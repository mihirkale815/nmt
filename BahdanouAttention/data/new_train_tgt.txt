and it can be a very complicated thing , what human health is .
and bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task , but what i &apos;m going to try to say is that even in that complexity , there &apos;s some simple themes that i think , if we understand , we can really move forward .
and those simple themes aren &apos;t really themes about the complex science of what &apos;s going on , but things that we all pretty well know .
and i &apos;m going to start with this one : if momma ain &apos;t happy , ain &apos;t nobody happy .
we know that , right ? we &apos;ve experienced that .
and if we just take that and we build from there , then we can go to the next step , which is that if the ocean ain &apos;t happy , ain &apos;t nobody happy .
that &apos;s the theme of my talk .
and we &apos;re making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways .
this is a shot of <unk> row in 1932 .
<unk> row , at the time , had the biggest industrial canning operation on the west coast .
we piled enormous amounts of pollution into the air and into the water .
<unk> <unk> , who was a professor at the <unk> &apos;s marine station where i work , wrote in the 1940s that &quot; the fumes from the scum floating on the <unk> of the bay were so bad they turned <unk> paints black . &quot;
people working in these <unk> could barely stay there all day because of the smell , but you know what they came out saying ?
they say , &quot; you know what you smell ?
that pollution was money to that community , and those people dealt with the pollution and absorbed it into their skin and into their bodies because they needed the money .
we made the ocean unhappy ; we made people very unhappy , and we made them unhealthy .
the connection between ocean health and human health is actually based upon another couple simple <unk> , and i want to call that &quot; pinch a <unk> , hurt a whale . &quot;
the pyramid of ocean life ...
we see the base of the food chain , the plankton , the small things , and we see how those animals are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid , and on so up this diagram .
and that flow , that flow of life , from the very base up to the very top , is the flow that ecologists see .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to preserve when we say , &quot; save the ocean . heal the ocean . &quot;
it &apos;s that pyramid .
because when we jam things in the bottom of that pyramid that shouldn &apos;t be there , some very frightening things happen .
pollutants , some pollutants have been created by us : molecules like pcbs that can &apos;t be broken down by our bodies .
and they go in the base of that pyramid , and they drift up ; they &apos;re passed up that way , on to predators and on to the top predators , and in so doing , they accumulate .
now , to bring that home , i thought i &apos;d invent a little game .
we don &apos;t really have to play it ; we can just think about it here .
it &apos;s the styrofoam and chocolate game .
imagine that when we got on this boat , we were all given two styrofoam peanuts .
can &apos;t do much with them : put them in your pocket .
suppose the rules are : every time you offer somebody a drink , you give them the drink , and you give them your styrofoam peanuts too .
what &apos;ll happen is that the styrofoam peanuts will start moving through our society here , and they will accumulate in the <unk> , <unk> people .
there &apos;s no mechanism in this game for them to go anywhere but into a bigger and bigger pile of <unk> styrofoam peanuts .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens with <unk> in this food pyramid : they accumulate into the top of it .
now suppose , instead of styrofoam peanuts , we take these lovely little chocolates that we get and we had those instead .
well , some of us would be eating those chocolates instead of passing them around , and instead of accumulating , they will just pass into our group here and not accumulate in any one group because they &apos;re absorbed by us .
and that &apos;s the difference between a <unk> and , say , something natural like an <unk> , something we want out of the marine food chain .
we have great examples of that , unfortunately .
pcbs accumulate in dolphins in <unk> bay , in texas , in north carolina .
they get into the food chain .
the dolphins eat the fish that have pcbs from the plankton , and those pcbs , being <unk> , accumulate in these dolphins .
now , a dolphin , mother dolphin , any dolphin -- there &apos;s only one way that a <unk> can get out of a dolphin .
and what &apos;s that ?
in mother &apos;s milk .
adult males : a huge load .
juveniles : a huge load .
females after their first calf is already <unk> : a lower load .
those females , they &apos;re not trying to .
those females are passing the pcbs in the fat of their own mother &apos;s milk into their offspring , and their offspring don &apos;t survive .
the death rate in these dolphins , for the first calf born of every female dolphin , is 60 to 80 percent .
these mothers pump their first offspring full of this pollutant , and most of them die .
now , the mother then can go and reproduce , but what a terrible price to pay for the accumulation of this pollutant in these animals -- the death of the first-born calf .
there &apos;s another top predator in the ocean , it turns out .
and we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places .
this is whale meat that i photographed in a grocery store in tokyo -- or is it ?
in fact , what we did a few years ago was learn how to smuggle a molecular biology lab into tokyo and use it to genetically test the dna out of whale meat samples and identify what they really were .
and some of those whale meat samples were whale meat .
that &apos;s another story .
even though they were labeled whale meat , they were dolphin meat .
and those dolphin parts had a huge load of pcbs , <unk> and heavy metals .
and that huge load was passing into the people that ate this meat .
it turns out that a lot of dolphins are being sold as meat in the whale meat market around the world .
that &apos;s a tragedy for those populations , but it &apos;s also a tragedy for the people eating them because they don &apos;t know that that &apos;s toxic meat .
we had these data a few years ago .
i remember sitting at my desk being about the only person in the world who knew that whale meat being sold in these markets was really dolphin meat , and it was toxic .
it had <unk> times the toxic loads ever allowed by the epa .
and for the very first time in my scientific career , i broke scientific protocol , which is that you take the data and publish them in scientific journals and then begin to talk about them .
but at least it &apos;s labeled correctly , and you &apos;re no longer going to be buying toxic dolphin meat instead .
these women have toxic breast milk .
they cannot feed their offspring , their children , their breast milk because of the accumulation of these toxins in their food chain , in their part of the world &apos;s ocean pyramid .
that means their immune systems are compromised .
it means that their children &apos;s development can be compromised .
and the world &apos;s attention on this over the last decade has reduced the problem for these women , not by changing the pyramid , but by changing what they particularly eat out of it .
we &apos;ve taken them out of their natural pyramid in order to solve this problem .
that &apos;s a good thing for this particular acute problem , but it does nothing to solve the pyramid problem .
there &apos;s other ways of breaking the pyramid .
the pyramid , if we jam things in the bottom , can get backed up like a sewer line that &apos;s clogged .
and if we jam nutrients , sewage , fertilizer in the base of that food pyramid , it can back up all through it .
we end up with things we &apos;ve heard about before : red tides , for example , which are blooms of toxic algae floating through the oceans causing neurological damage .
we can also see blooms of bacteria , blooms of viruses in the ocean .
these are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here and a bacteria in the genus vibrio , which includes the genus that has cholera in it .
how many people have seen a &quot; beach closed &quot; sign ?
why does that happen ?
it happens because we have <unk> so much into the base of the natural ocean pyramid that these bacteria clog it up and <unk> onto our beaches .
often what jams us up is sewage .
now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park where you had a big sign at the front saying , &quot; closed because human sewage is so far over this park that you can &apos;t use it &quot; ?
not very often . we wouldn &apos;t tolerate that .
we wouldn &apos;t tolerate our parks being <unk> by human sewage , but beaches are closed a lot in our country .
it &apos;s not just a question of cleanliness ; it &apos;s also a question of how those organisms then turn into human disease .
these <unk> , these bacteria , can actually infect people .
they can go into your skin and create skin infections .
this is a graph from noaa &apos;s ocean and human health initiative , showing the rise of the infections by vibrio in people over the last few years .
surfers , for example , know this incredibly .
and if you can see on some surfing sites , in fact , not only do you see what the waves are like or what the weather &apos;s like , but on some surf rider sites , you see a little flashing poo alert .
some of these infections are actually carrying antibiotic resistance genes now , and that makes them even more difficult .
these same infections create harmful algal blooms .
those blooms are generating other kinds of chemicals .
this is just a simple list of some of the types of poisons that come out of these harmful algal blooms : shellfish poisoning , fish <unk> , <unk> shellfish poisoning -- you don &apos;t want to know about that -- <unk> shellfish poisoning , <unk> shellfish poisoning .
these are things that are getting into our food chain because of these blooms .
<unk> <unk> very famously traced a very interesting story of cholera into human communities , brought there , not by a normal human vector , but by a marine vector , this <unk> .
copepods are small crustaceans .
they &apos;re a tiny fraction of an inch long , and they can carry on their little legs some of the cholera bacteria that then leads to human disease .
that has sparked cholera epidemics in ports along the world and has led to increased concentration on trying to make sure shipping doesn &apos;t move these vectors of cholera around the world .
so what do you do ?
we have major problems in disrupted ecosystem flow that the pyramid may not be working so well , that the flow from the base up into it is being blocked and clogged .
what do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow ?
well , there &apos;s a bunch of things you could do .
you could call joe the plumber , for example .
and he could come in and fix the flow .
monterey is one of those .
in 1932 , that &apos;s the picture .
in 2009 , the picture is dramatically different .
the <unk> are gone . the pollution has <unk> .
but there &apos;s a greater sense here that what the individual communities need is working ecosystems .
they need a functioning pyramid from the base all the way to the top .
and that pyramid in monterey , right now , because of the efforts of a lot of different people , is functioning better than it &apos;s ever <unk> for the last 150 years .
it didn &apos;t happen accidentally .
it happened because many people put their time and effort and their pioneering spirit into this .
on the left there , julia <unk> , the mayor of my little hometown in pacific grove .
at 74 years old , became mayor because something had to be done to protect the ocean .
that change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift , not only in the fortunes of monterey bay , but other places around the world .
well , i want to leave you with the thought that what we &apos;re really trying to do here is protect this ocean pyramid , and that ocean pyramid connects to our own pyramid of life .
it &apos;s an ocean planet , and we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species , but the pyramid of life in the ocean and our own lives on land are intricately connected .
and it &apos;s only through having the ocean being healthy that we can remain healthy ourselves .
stephen <unk> : following the mercury trail
adrian <unk> : well , we &apos;re here today to talk about the evolution of a puppet horse .
basil jones : but actually we &apos;re going to start this evolution with a hyena .
okay , we &apos;ll do something with it .
the hyena is the ancestor of the horse because it was part of a production called &quot; <unk> in africa , &quot; a handspring production from 1995 , where it had to play <unk> with helen of troy .
this production was directed by south african artist and theater director , william <unk> .
so it needed a very articulate front paw .
but , like all puppets , it has other attributes .
bj : breath is really important for us .
it &apos;s the kind of original movement for any puppet for us onstage .
puppets always have to try to be alive .
it &apos;s their kind of <unk> onstage , that desperation to live .
ak : yeah , it &apos;s basically a dead object , as you can see , and it only lives because you make it .
an actor struggles to die onstage , but a puppet has to struggle to live .
and in a way that &apos;s a metaphor for life .
bj : so every moment it &apos;s on the stage , it &apos;s making the struggle .
so we call this a piece of emotional engineering that uses <unk> 17th century technology -- to turn <unk> into verbs .
ak : well actually i prefer to say that it &apos;s an object constructed out of wood and cloth with movement built into it to persuade you to believe that it has life .
ak : it has ears that move passively when the head goes .
bj : and it has these <unk> made out of plywood , covered with fabric -- curiously similar , in fact , to the plywood canoes that adrian &apos;s father used to make when he was a boy in their workshop .
and when we met at art school and fell in love in 1971 , i hated puppets .
i really thought they were so beneath me .
and , in fact , it took about 10 years to discover the <unk> bamana puppets of mali in west africa , where there &apos;s a fabulous tradition of puppetry , to learn a renewed , or a new , respect for this art form .
ak : so in 1981 , i persuaded basil and some friends of mine to form a puppet company .
and 20 years later , miraculously , we collaborated with a company from mali , the <unk> <unk> troupe of <unk> , where we made a piece about a tall giraffe .
it was just called &quot; tall horse , &quot; which was a <unk> giraffe .
the <unk> have now turned into <unk> of cane , but it &apos;s ultimately the same structure .
ak : the person in the hind legs is also controlling the tail , a bit like the hyena -- same mechanism , just a bit bigger .
and he &apos;s controlling the ear movement .
bj : so this production was seen by tom morris of the national theatre in london .
ak : it &apos;s about a boy who falls in love with a horse .
the horse is sold to the first world war , and he joins up to find his horse .
bj : so tom gave us a call and said , &quot; do you think you could make us a horse for a show to happen at the national theatre ? &quot;
ak : it seemed a lovely idea .
bj : but it had to ride . it had to have a rider .
a play about early 20th century plowing technology and cavalry charges was a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department at the national theatre in london .
so we began with a test .
bj : this is adrian and <unk> <unk> , who went on to actually design the cane system for the horse , and our next-door neighbor <unk> , riding on a ladder .
the weight is really difficult when it &apos;s up above your head .
so we made a model .
this is a cardboard model , a little bit smaller than the hyena .
you &apos;ll notice that the legs are plywood legs and the canoe structure is still there .
bj : and the two <unk> are inside .
but we didn &apos;t realize at the time that we actually needed a third <unk> , because we couldn &apos;t manipulate the neck from inside and walk the horse at the same time .
ak : we started work on the prototype after the model was approved , and the prototype took a bit longer than we anticipated .
and we had a crate built for it .
it had to be shipped to london .
we were going to <unk> it on the street outside of our house in cape town , and it got to midnight and we hadn &apos;t done that yet .
bj : so we got a camera , and we posed the puppet in various galloping <unk> .
and we sent it off to the national theatre , hoping that they believed that we created something that worked .
ak : a month later , we were there in london with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us .
bj : about 40 people .
we opened the lid , we took the horse out , and it did work ; it walked and it was able to be ridden .
here i have an <unk> clip of the very first walk of the prototype .
this is in the national theatre studio , the place where they cook new ideas .
it had by no means got the green light yet .
the choreographer , <unk> <unk> , invented a beautiful sequence where the baby horse , which was made out of sticks and bits of twigs , grew up into the big horse .
and nick <unk> , the director of the national theatre , saw that particular moment , he was standing next to me -- he nearly wet himself .
and so the show was given the green light .
and we went back to cape town and redesigned the horse completely .
here is the plan .
and here is our factory in cape town where we make horses .
the horses are completely handmade .
but because they have to be light and flexible , and each one of them is different , they can &apos;t be mass-produced , unfortunately .
so here are some <unk> horses ready to be worked in london .
and now we would like to introduce you to joey .
joey boy , you there ?
joey .
joey .
joey , come here .
no , no , i haven &apos;t got it .
come here . stand here where people can see you .
move around . come on .
i &apos;d just like to describe -- i won &apos;t talk too loud . he might get irritated .
he has bicycle brake cables going down to the head control in his hand .
each one of them operates either an ear , separately , or the head , up and down .
but he also controls the head directly by using his hand .
the ears are obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse .
when they point right back , the horse is fearful or angry , depending upon what &apos;s going on in front of him , around him .
or , when he &apos;s more relaxed , the head comes down and the ears listen , either side .
horses &apos; hearing is very important .
it &apos;s almost more important than their eyesight .
over here , tommy &apos;s got what you call the heart position .
he &apos;s working the leg .
you see the string tendon from the hyena , the hyena &apos;s front leg , automatically pulls the hoop up .
horses are so unpredictable .
the way a <unk> comes up with a horse immediately gives you the feeling that it &apos;s a convincing horse action .
bj : and mikey also has , in his fingers , the ability to move the tail from left to right , and up and down with the other hand .
and together , there &apos;s quite a complex possibility of tail expression .
adrian thought that he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in two and make it breathe like that -- because that &apos;s how a horse would breathe , with an expanded chest .
so he made a channel in here , and the chest moves up and down in that channel .
so it &apos;s <unk> really , the up and down movement , but it feels like breath .
and it &apos;s very , very simple because all that happens is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees .
if i were to touch the horse here on his skin , the heart puppeteer can shake the body from inside and get the skin to <unk> .
and i would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice , that i was making a three-dimensional drawing of a horse that somehow moves in space .
the skin itself is made out of a see-through nylon mesh , which , if the lighting designer wants the horse to almost disappear , she can light the background and the horse becomes <unk> .
or if you light it from above , it becomes more solid .
again , that was a practical consideration .
the guys inside the horse have to be able to see out .
they have to be able to act and it &apos;s very much an <unk> activity that they &apos;re engaged in .
it &apos;s three heads making one character .
but now we would like you to put joey through some paces .
and plant .
thank you .
and now just -- all the way from sunny california we have <unk> joaquin who &apos;s going to ride the horse for us .
so we would like to stress that the performance you see in the horse is three guys who have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly .
bj : not being able to talk to one another while they &apos;re onstage because they &apos;re mic &apos;d .
the sound that that very large chest makes , of the horse -- the <unk> and the <unk> and everything -- that starts usually with one performer , carries on with a second person and ends with a third .
ak : mikey <unk> from <unk> .
mikey <unk> , craig , leo , <unk> joaquin and basil and me .
thank you . thank you .
handspring puppet co . : the genius puppetry behind war horse
let &apos;s start with day and night .
life evolved under conditions of light and darkness , light and then darkness .
and so plants and animals developed their own internal clocks so that they would be ready for these changes in light .
these are chemical clocks , and they &apos;re found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell .
it &apos;ll do this for weeks , until it kind of gradually loses the plot .
and it &apos;s incredible to watch , but there &apos;s nothing psychic or paranormal going on ; it &apos;s simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond , usually , with what &apos;s going on around it .
and in humans , we call it the &quot; body clock . &quot;
you can see this most clearly when you take away someone &apos;s watch and you shut them into a bunker , deep underground , for a couple of months .
people actually volunteer for this , and they usually come out kind of <unk> about their productive time in the hole .
so , no matter how <unk> these subjects would have to be , they all show the same thing .
they get up just a little bit later every day -- say 15 minutes or so -- and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this over the course of the weeks .
and so , in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks , rather than somehow sensing the day outside .
so fine , we have a body clock , and it turns out that it &apos;s incredibly important in our lives .
it &apos;s a huge driver for culture and i think that it &apos;s the most <unk> force on our behavior .
we evolved as a species near the equator , and so we &apos;re very <unk> to deal with 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness .
but of course , we &apos;ve spread to every corner of the globe and in arctic canada , where i live , we have perpetual daylight in summer and 24 hours of darkness in winter .
so the culture , the northern aboriginal culture , traditionally has been highly seasonal .
in winter , there &apos;s a lot of sleeping going on ; you enjoy your family life inside .
and in summer , it &apos;s almost manic hunting and working activity very long hours , very active .
so , what would our natural rhythm look like ?
well , it turns out that when people are living without any sort of artificial light at all , they sleep twice every night .
they go to bed around 8 : 00 p.m.
until midnight and then again , they sleep from about 2 : 00 a.m. until sunrise .
and <unk> , they have a couple of hours of sort of <unk> quiet in bed .
and during this time , there &apos;s a surge of <unk> , the likes of which a modern day never sees .
the people in these studies report feeling so awake during the daytime , that they realize they &apos;re experiencing true <unk> for the first time in their lives .
so , cut to the modern day .
we &apos;re living in a culture of jet lag , global travel , 24-hour business , shift work .
thank you .
<unk> gamble : our natural sleep cycle
i want to help you <unk> what philanthropy is , what it could be , and what your relationship to it is .
i want to start with these word pairs here .
we all know which side of these we &apos;d like to be on .
when philanthropy was reinvented a century ago , when the foundation form was actually invented , they didn &apos;t think of themselves on the wrong side of these either .
in fact they would never have thought of themselves as closed and set in their ways , as slow to respond to new challenges , as small and risk-averse .
and in fact they weren &apos;t . they were reinventing charity in those times , what rockefeller called &quot; the business of benevolence . &quot;
but by the end of the 20th century , a new generation of critics and reformers had come to see philanthropy just this way .
this entrepreneurial energy is emerging from many quarters .
and it &apos;s driven and propelled forward by new leaders , like many of the people here , by new tools , like the ones we &apos;ve seen here , and by new pressures .
i &apos;ve been following this change for quite a while now , and participating in it .
this report is our main public report .
what it tells is the story of how today actually could be as historic as 100 years ago .
what i want to do is share some of the coolest things that are going on with you .
and as i do that , i &apos;m not going to dwell much on the very large philanthropy that everybody already knows about -- the gates or the soros or the google .
instead , what i want to do is talk about the philanthropy of all of us : the democratization of philanthropy .
this is a moment in history when the average person has more power than at any time .
what i &apos;m going to do is look at five categories of experiments , each of which challenges an old assumption of philanthropy .
the first is mass collaboration , represented here by wikipedia .
now , this may surprise you .
but remember , philanthropy is about giving of time and talent , not just money .
he said , &quot; we have lived in this world where little things are done for love and big things for money .
now we have wikipedia .
suddenly big things can be done for love . &quot;
watch , this spring , for paul hawken &apos;s new book -- author and entrepreneur many of you may know about .
the book is called &quot; blessed unrest . &quot;
and when it comes out , a series of wiki sites under the label wiser , are going to launch at the same time .
wiser stands for world index for social and environmental responsibility .
wiser sets out to document , link and empower what paul calls the largest movement , and fastest-growing movement in human history : humanity &apos;s collective immune response to today &apos;s threats .
now , all of these big things for love -- experiments -- aren &apos;t going to take off .
but the ones that do are going to be the biggest , the most open , the fastest , the most connected form of philanthropy in human history .
this is , of course , to philanthropy what ebay and amazon are to commerce .
think of it as peer-to-peer philanthropy .
and this challenges yet another assumption , which is that organized philanthropy is only for the very wealthy .
take a look , if you haven &apos;t , at <unk> .
omidyar network has made a big investment in <unk> .
it &apos;s one of the best known of these new marketplaces where a donor can go straight into a classroom and connect with what a teacher says they need .
take a look at changing the present , started by a tedster , next time you need a wedding present or a holiday present .
<unk> is for a whole country .
and it goes on and on .
the third category is represented by warren buffet , which i call aggregated giving .
it &apos;s not just that warren buffet was so amazingly generous in that historic act last summer .
it &apos;s that he challenged another assumption , that every <unk> should have his or her own fund or foundation .
one of the best known is acumen fund , led by jacqueline novogratz , a tedster who got a big boost here at ted .
but there are many others : new profit in cambridge , new school &apos;s venture fund in silicon valley , venture philanthropy partners in washington , global fund for women in san francisco .
take a look at these .
these funds are to philanthropy what venture capital , private equity , and eventually mutual funds are to investing , but with a twist -- because often a community forms around these funds , as it has at acumen and other places .
now , imagine for a second these first three types of experiments : mass collaboration , online marketplaces , aggregated giving .
and understand how they help us <unk> what organized philanthropy is .
it &apos;s not about foundations necessarily ; it &apos;s about the rest of us .
i &apos;m going to look quickly at the fourth and fifth categories , which are innovation , competitions and social investing .
they &apos;re betting a visible competition , a prize , can attract talent and money to some of the most difficult issues , and thereby speed the solution .
this tackles yet another assumption , that the <unk> and the organization is at the center , as opposed to putting the problem at the center .
you can look to these innovators to help us especially with things that require technological or scientific solution .
that leaves the final category , social investing , which is really , anyway , the biggest of them all , represented here by <unk>
and this , of course , tackles the biggest assumption of all , that business is business , and philanthropy is the vehicle of people who want to create change in the world .
<unk> is a new community site that &apos;s built by the community , linking and mapping this new social capital market .
it lists already 1,000 entities that are offering debt and equity for social enterprise .
so we can look to these innovators to help us remember that if we can leverage even a small amount of the capital that seeks a return , the good that can be driven could be astonishing .
now , what &apos;s really interesting here is that we &apos;re not thinking our way into a new way of acting ; we &apos;re acting our way into a new way of thinking .
philanthropy is <unk> itself before our very eyes .
and even though all of the experiments and all of the big <unk> don &apos;t yet fulfill this aspiration , i think this is the new zeitgeist : open , big , fast , connected , and , let us also hope , long .
we have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things .
if we don &apos;t develop the stamina to stick with things -- whatever it is you pick , stick with it -- all of this stuff is just going to be , you know , a <unk> .
but i &apos;m really hopeful .
and everywhere i go , including here at ted , i feel that there is a new moral hunger that is growing .
what we &apos;re seeing is people really wrestling to describe what is this new thing that &apos;s happening .
words like &quot; <unk> , &quot; and &quot; natural capitalism , &quot; and &quot; <unk> , &quot; and &quot; venture philanthropy . &quot;
we don &apos;t have a language for it yet .
whatever we call it , it &apos;s new , it &apos;s beginning , and i think it &apos;s <unk> to quite significant .
and that &apos;s where my imagined future comes in , which i am going to call the social singularity .
many of you will realize that i &apos;m ripping a bit off of the science fiction writer <unk> <unk> &apos;s notion of a technological singularity , where a number of trends accelerate and converge and come together to create , really , a shockingly new reality .
it may be that the social singularity ahead is the one that we fear the most : a convergence of catastrophes , of environmental degradation , of weapons of mass destruction , of pandemics , of poverty .
that &apos;s because our ability to confront the problems that we face has not kept pace with our ability to create them .
and as we &apos;ve heard here , it is no exaggeration to say that we hold the future of our civilization in our hands as never before .
the question is , is there a positive social singularity ?
is there a frontier for us of how we live together ?
our future doesn &apos;t have to be imagined .
we can create a future where hope and history rhyme .
but we have a problem .
our experience to date , both individually and collectively , hasn &apos;t prepared us for what we &apos;re going to need to do , or who we &apos;re going to need to be .
we are going to need a new generation of citizen leaders willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning as rapidly as possible .
that &apos;s why i have one last thing i want to show you .
this is a photograph taken about 100 years ago of my grandfather and great-grandfather .
this is a newspaper publisher and a banker .
and they were great community leaders .
and , yes , they were great philanthropists .
and so , in their honor , i want to offer you this blank slide .
and i want you to imagine that this a photograph of you .
and i want you to think about the community that you want to be part of creating .
whatever that means to you .
and i want you to imagine that it &apos;s 100 years from now , and your grandchild , or <unk> , or niece or <unk> or <unk> , is looking at this photograph of you .
<unk> <unk> : you are the future of philanthropy
i believe that there are new , hidden tensions that are actually happening between people and institutions -- institutions that are the institutions that people inhabit in their daily life : schools , hospitals , workplaces , factories , offices , etc .
and something that i see happening is something that i would like to call a sort of &quot; democratization of intimacy . &quot;
and what do i mean by that ?
i mean that what people are doing is , in fact , they are sort of , with their communication channels , they are breaking an imposed isolation that these institutions are imposing on them .
how are they doing this ? they &apos;re doing it in a very simple way , by calling their mom from work , by <unk> from their office to their friends , by texting under the desk .
the pictures that you &apos;re seeing behind me are people that i visited in the last few months .
and i asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most .
and somebody brought a boyfriend , somebody a father .
one young woman brought her grandfather .
for 20 years , i &apos;ve been looking at how people use channels such as email , the mobile phone , texting , etc .
what we &apos;re actually going to see is that , fundamentally , people are communicating on a regular basis with five , six , seven of their most intimate sphere .
now , lets take some data . facebook .
recently some sociologists from facebook -- facebook is the channel that you would expect is the most <unk> of all channels .
and an average user , said cameron <unk> , from facebook , has about 120 friends .
but he actually talks to , has two-way exchanges with , about four to six people on a regular base , depending on his gender .
academic research on instant messaging also shows 100 people on buddy lists , but fundamentally people chat with two , three , four -- anyway , less than five .
and when you go to skype , it &apos;s down to two people .
a lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed .
i mean , i &apos;ve been a bit disappointed sometimes when i saw this data and all this deployment , just for five people .
and some sociologists actually feel that it &apos;s a closure , it &apos;s a <unk> , that we &apos;re <unk> from the public .
and i would actually , i would like to show you that if we actually look at who is doing it , and from where they &apos;re doing it , actually there is an incredible social transformation .
there are three stories that i think are quite good examples .
the first gentleman , he &apos;s a baker .
and so he starts working every morning at four o &apos;clock in the morning .
and around eight o &apos;clock he sort of <unk> away from his oven , cleans his hands from the flour and calls his wife .
he just wants to wish her a good day , because that &apos;s the start of her day .
and i &apos;ve heard this story a number of times .
or a mother who , at four o &apos;clock , suddenly manages to find a corner in the toilet to check that her children are safely home .
then there is another couple , there is a brazilian couple .
they &apos;ve lived in italy for a number of years .
they skype with their families a few times a week .
but once a <unk> , they actually put the computer on their dining table , pull out the webcam and actually have dinner with their family in sao paulo . and they have a big event of it .
and i heard this story the first time a couple of years ago from a very modest family of immigrants from kosovo in switzerland .
they had set up a big screen in their living room , and every morning they had breakfast with their grandmother .
and then there is the third couple . they are two friends .
they chat to each other every day , a few times a day actually .
and finally , finally , they &apos;ve managed to put instant messaging on their computers at work .
and now , obviously , they have it open .
and this is exactly what we &apos;ve been seeing with teenagers and kids doing it in school , under the table , and texting under the table to their friends .
so , none of these cases are unique .
i mean , i could tell you hundreds of them .
but what is really exceptional is the setting .
so , think of the three settings i &apos;ve talked to you about : factory , migration , office .
but it could be in a school , it could be an administration , it could be a hospital .
if you were lucky there was a public phone hanging in the corridor or somewhere .
if you were in management , oh , that was a different story .
maybe you had a direct line .
if you were not , you maybe had to go through an operator .
but basically , when you walked into those buildings , the private sphere was left behind you .
and this has become such a norm of our professional lives , such a norm and such an expectation .
and it had nothing to do with technical capability .
the phones were there . but the expectation was once you moved in there your commitment was fully to the task at hand , fully to the people around you .
that was where the focus had to be .
and this has become such a cultural norm that we actually school our children for them to be capable to do this <unk> .
if you think nursery , kindergarten , first years of school are just dedicated to take away the children , to make them used to staying long hours away from their family .
and then the school <unk> perfectly well .
and of course , the major thing : learn to pay attention , to concentrate and focus your attention .
this only started about 150 years ago .
it only started with the birth of modern bureaucracy , and of industrial revolution .
when people basically had to go somewhere else to work and carry out the work .
so , until then , basically people were living on top of their trades .
they were living on top of the land they were <unk> .
they were living on top of the workshops where they were working .
and if you think , it &apos;s permeated our whole culture , even our cities .
if you think of medieval cities , medieval cities the boroughs all have the names of the <unk> and professions that lived there .
now we have <unk> residential <unk> that are well distinct from production areas and commercial areas .
and actually , over these 150 years , there has been a very clear class system that also has emerged .
so the lower the status of the job and of the person carrying out , the more removed he would be from his personal sphere .
people have taken this amazing possibility of actually being in contact all through the day or in all types of situations .
and they are doing it massively .
i really think that the number is conservative .
in my own research , we saw that the peak for private email is actually 11 o &apos;clock in the morning , whatever the country .
75 percent of people admit doing private conversations from work on their mobile phones .
100 percent are using text .
the point is that this <unk> of the personal sphere is not terribly successful with all institutions .
i &apos;m always surprised the u.s. army sociologists are discussing of the impact for instance , of soldiers in iraq having daily contact with their families .
but there are many institutions that are actually blocking this access .
and every day , every single day , i read news that makes me <unk> , like a $ 15 fine to kids in texas , for using , every time they take out their mobile phone in school .
immediate <unk> to bus drivers in new york , if seen with a mobile phone in a hand .
companies blocking access to im or to facebook .
and they are actually trying to block , in a certain sense , this movement of a greater possibility of intimacy .
<unk> <unk> : how the internet enables intimacy
so , how many of you have ever gotten behind the wheel of a car when you really shouldn &apos;t have been driving ?
maybe you &apos;re out on the road for a long day , and you just wanted to get home .
you were tired , but you felt you could drive a few more miles .
maybe you thought , i &apos;ve had less to drink than everybody else , i should be the one to go home .
or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere .
does this sound familiar to you ?
now , in those situations , wouldn &apos;t it be great if there was a button on your dashboard that you could push , and the car would get you home safely ?
now , that &apos;s been the promise of the self-driving car , the autonomous vehicle , and it &apos;s been the dream since at least 1939 , when general motors <unk> this idea at their <unk> booth at the world &apos;s fair .
now , it &apos;s been one of those dreams that &apos;s always seemed about 20 years in the future .
now , two weeks ago , that dream took a step forward , when the state of nevada granted google &apos;s self-driving car the very first license for an autonomous vehicle , clearly establishing that it &apos;s legal for them to test it on the roads in nevada .
now , california &apos;s considering similar legislation , and this would make sure that the autonomous car is not one of those things that has to stay in vegas .
now , why would we want to do such a thing ?
well , there &apos;s two really good reasons for this .
first , we believe that before people turn over control to an autonomous car , that autonomous car should be at least as good as the very best human drivers .
now , if you &apos;re like me , and the other 70 percent of the population who know that we are above-average drivers , you understand that &apos;s a very high bar .
there &apos;s another reason as well .
just like race car drivers can use all of the friction between the tire and the road , all of the car &apos;s capabilities to go as fast as possible , we want to use all of those capabilities to avoid any accident we can .
now , you may push the car to the limits not because you &apos;re driving too fast , but because you &apos;ve hit an icy patch of road , conditions have changed .
in those situations , we want a car that is capable enough to avoid any accident that can physically be avoided .
i must confess , there &apos;s kind of a third motivation as well .
you see , i have a passion for racing .
in the past , i &apos;ve been a race car owner , a crew chief and a driving coach , although maybe not at the level that you &apos;re currently expecting .
it &apos;s another one of those categories where maybe there &apos;s not a lot of competition .
but this is <unk> . it &apos;s an entirely <unk> electric vehicle , which through using its <unk> drive and <unk> <unk> can drift around corners .
it can get sideways like a rally car driver , always able to take the <unk> curve , even on slippery , changing surfaces , never spinning out .
i guess it goes without saying that we &apos;ve had a lot of fun doing this .
but in fact , there &apos;s something else that we &apos;ve developed in the process of developing these autonomous cars .
we have developed a tremendous appreciation for the capabilities of human race car drivers .
as we &apos;ve looked at the question of how well do these cars perform , we wanted to compare them to our human counterparts .
and we discovered their human counterparts are amazing .
now , we can take a map of a race track , we can take a mathematical model of a car , and with some iteration , we can actually find the fastest way around that track .
we line that up with data that we record from a professional driver , and the resemblance is absolutely remarkable .
they &apos;re able to go out and consistently do this , pushing the car to the limits every single time .
it &apos;s extraordinary to watch .
you put them in a new car , and after a few laps , they &apos;ve found the fastest line in that car , and they &apos;re off to the races .
it really makes you think , we &apos;d love to know what &apos;s going on inside their brain .
so as researchers , that &apos;s what we decided to find out .
we decided to instrument not only the car , but also the race car driver , to try to get a glimpse into what was going on in their head as they were doing this .
now , this is dr. <unk> <unk> applying electrodes to the head of john morton .
john morton is a former <unk> and <unk> driver , who &apos;s also a class champion at le <unk> .
fantastic driver , and very willing to put up with graduate students and this sort of research .
she &apos;s putting electrodes on his head so that we can monitor the electrical activity in john &apos;s brain as he races around the track .
now , clearly we &apos;re not going to put a couple of electrodes on his head and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track .
however , neuroscientists have identified certain patterns that let us tease out some very important aspects of this .
in contrast , theta waves are associated with a lot of cognitive activity , like visual processing , things where the driver is thinking quite a bit .
now , we can measure this , and we can look at the relative power between the theta waves and the alpha waves .
this gives us a measure of mental workload , how much the driver is actually challenged cognitively at any point along the track .
now , we wanted to see if we could actually record this on the track , so we headed down south to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is a legendary <unk> about halfway between salinas and monterey .
it has a curve there called the <unk> .
now , the <unk> is a <unk> , followed by a quick right-handed turn as the road drops three stories .
now , the strategy for driving this as explained to me was , you aim for the bush in the distance , and as the road falls away , you realize it was actually the top of a tree .
all right , so thanks to the <unk> program at stanford , we were able to take john there and put him behind the wheel of a 1960 porsche <unk> <unk> .
life is way too short for boring cars .
so , here you see john on the track , he &apos;s going up the hill -- oh ! somebody liked that -- and you can see , actually , his mental workload -- measuring here in the red bar -- you can see his actions as he approaches .
now watch , he has to <unk> .
look for the tree , and down .
not surprisingly , you can see this is a pretty challenging task .
you can see his mental workload spike as he goes through this , as you would expect with something that requires this level of complexity .
but what &apos;s really interesting is to look at areas of the track where his mental workload doesn &apos;t increase .
i &apos;m going to take you around now to the other side of the track .
turn three . and john &apos;s going to go into that corner and the rear end of the car is going to begin to slide out .
he &apos;s going to have to correct for that with steering .
so watch as john does this here .
watch the mental workload , and watch the steering .
the car begins to slide out , dramatic maneuver to correct it , and no change whatsoever in the mental workload .
in fact , entirely <unk> .
now , our data processing on this is still preliminary , but it really seems that these phenomenal feats that the race car drivers are performing are instinctive .
they are things that they have simply learned to do .
it requires very little mental workload for them to perform these amazing feats .
and their actions are fantastic .
this is exactly what you want to do on the steering wheel to catch the car in this situation .
now , this has given us tremendous insight and inspiration for our own autonomous vehicles .
we &apos;ve started to ask the question : can we make them a little less algorithmic and a little more intuitive ?
can we take this <unk> action that we see from the very best race car drivers , introduce it to our cars , and maybe even into a system that could get onto your car in the future ?
that would take us a long step along the road to autonomous vehicles that drive as well as the best humans .
but it &apos;s made us think a little bit more deeply as well .
do we want something more from our car than to simply be a <unk> ?
do we want our car to perhaps be a partner , a coach , someone that can use their understanding of the situation to help us reach our potential ?
can , in fact , the technology not simply replace humans , but allow us to reach the level of reflex and intuition that we &apos;re all capable of ?
so , as we move forward into this technological future , i want you to just pause and think of that for a moment .
what is the ideal balance of human and machine ?
and as we think about that , let &apos;s take inspiration from the absolutely amazing capabilities of the human body and the human mind .
thank you .
chris <unk> : the future race car -- <unk> , and no driver
so today , i &apos;m going to tell you about some people who didn &apos;t move out of their neighborhoods .
the first one is happening right here in chicago .
brenda <unk> was hired to help <unk> <unk> society and keep them from going back into prison .
we know that two-thirds of them are going to go back .
i find it interesting that , for every one dollar we spend , however , on early childhood education , like head start , we save 17 dollars on stuff like incarceration in the future .
or -- think about it -- that 60,000 dollars is more than what it costs to send one person to harvard as well .
but brenda , not being <unk> by stuff like that , took a look at her challenge and came up with a <unk> solution : create a business that produces skin care products from honey .
okay , it might be obvious to some of you ; it wasn &apos;t to me .
it &apos;s the basis of growing a form of social innovation that has real potential .
she combined employment experience and training with life skills they needed , like <unk> and teamwork , and also how to talk to future employers about how their experiences actually demonstrated the lessons that they had learned and their <unk> to learn more .
less than four percent actually go back to jail .
so these young men and women learned <unk> and life skills through bee keeping and became productive citizens in the process .
talk about a sweet beginning .
now , i &apos;m going to take you to los angeles , and lots of people know that l.a. has its issues .
they have not enough water on most days and too much to handle when it rains .
currently , 20 percent of california &apos;s energy consumption is used to pump water into mostly southern california .
their spending loads , loads , to channel that rainwater out into the ocean when it rains and floods as well .
now andy <unk> is working to help l.a. cut infrastructure costs associated with water management and urban heat island -- linking trees , people and technology to create a more livable city .
all that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water , also helps cool our cities .
because , come to think about it , do you really want air-conditioning , or is it a cooler room that you want ?
how you get it shouldn &apos;t make that much of a difference .
so a few years ago , l.a. county decided that they needed to spend 2.5 billion dollars to repair the city schools .
and andy and his team discovered that they were going to spend 200 million of those dollars on asphalt to surround the schools themselves .
and by presenting a really strong economic case , they convinced the l.a. government that replacing that asphalt with trees and other greenery , that the schools themselves would save the system more on energy than they spend on <unk> infrastructure .
now judy bonds is a coal miner &apos;s daughter .
and if anyone should be clinging to the former glory of the coal mining history , and of the town , it should be judy .
but the way coal is mined right now is different from the deep mines that her father and her father &apos;s father would go down into and that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people .
now , two dozen men can tear down a mountain in several months , and only for about a few years &apos; worth of coal .
it can make a mountain go from this to this in a few short months .
just imagine that the air surrounding these places -- it &apos;s filled with the residue of explosives and coal .
when we visited , it gave some of the people we were with this strange little cough after being only there for just a few hours or so -- not just miners , but everybody .
and judy saw her landscape being destroyed and her water poisoned .
and the coal companies just move on after the mountain was emptied , leaving even more unemployment in their wake .
but she also saw the difference in potential wind energy on an intact mountain , and one that was reduced in elevation by over 2,000 feet .
three years of dirty energy with not many jobs , or centuries of clean energy with the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency based on technical skills , and developing local knowledge about how to get the most out of that region &apos;s wind .
she calculated the <unk> cost and the payback over time , and it &apos;s a <unk> on so many levels for the local , national and global economy .
it &apos;s a longer payback than mountaintop removal , but the wind energy actually pays back forever .
now mountaintop removal pays very little money to the locals , and it gives them a lot of misery .
the water is turned into goo .
most people are still unemployed , leading to most of the same kinds of social problems that unemployed people in inner cities also experience -- drug and alcohol abuse , domestic abuse , teen pregnancy and poor heath , as well .
now judy and i -- i have to say -- totally related to each other .
not quite an obvious alliance .
i mean , literally , her hometown is called <unk> , west virginia .
i mean , they are not -- they ain &apos;t competing for the birthplace of hip hop title or anything like that .
but the back of my t-shirt , the one that she gave me , says , &quot; save the endangered hillbillies . &quot;
so <unk> and hillbillies we got it together and totally understand that this is what it &apos;s all about .
but just a few months ago , judy was diagnosed with <unk> lung cancer .
and it has since moved to her bones and her brain .
and i just find it so bizarre that she &apos;s suffering from the same thing that she tried so hard to protect people from .
but her dream of coal river mountain wind is her legacy .
and she might not get to see that mountaintop .
but rather than writing yet some kind of manifesto or something , she &apos;s leaving behind a business plan to make it happen .
that &apos;s what my <unk> is doing .
so i &apos;m so proud of that .
but these three people don &apos;t know each other , but they do have an awful lot in common .
they &apos;re all problem <unk> , and they &apos;re just some of the many examples that i really am privileged to see , meet and learn from in the examples of the work that i do now .
i was really lucky to have them all featured on my corporation for public radio radio show called <unk>
now they &apos;re all very practical visionaries .
they take a look at the demands that are out there -- beauty products , healthy schools , electricity -- and how the money &apos;s flowing to meet those demands .
and when the cheapest solutions involve reducing the number of jobs , you &apos;re left with unemployed people , and those people aren &apos;t cheap .
in fact , they make up some of what i call the most expensive citizens , and they include <unk> impoverished , traumatized vets returning from the middle east , people coming out of jail .
and for the veterans in particular , the <unk> said there &apos;s a <unk> increase in mental health pharmaceuticals by vets since 2003 .
i think that number &apos;s probably going to go up .
they &apos;re not the largest number of people , but they are some of the most expensive -- and in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse , drug and alcohol abuse , poor performance by their kids in schools and also poor health as a result of stress .
so these three guys all understand how to productively channel dollars through our local economies to meet existing market demands , reduce the social problems that we have now and prevent new problems in the future .
and there are plenty of other examples like that .
one problem : waste handling and unemployment .
even when we think or talk about recycling , lots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfills and leaving many municipalities , diversion rates -- they leave much to be recycled .
and where is this waste handled ? usually in poor communities .
and in my hometown , we actually tried to do one of these in the bronx , but our mayor decided what he wanted to see was a jail on that same spot .
fortunately -- because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs -- but after many years , the city wanted to build a jail .
they &apos;ve since abandoned that project , thank goodness .
another problem : unhealthy food systems and unemployment .
working-class and poor urban americans are not benefiting economically from our current food system .
it relies too much on transportation , chemical fertilization , big use of water and also refrigeration .
<unk> agricultural operations often are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land , and it produces this incredibly unhealthy product that costs us billions in healthcare and lost productivity .
the numbers just aren &apos;t there .
this can support seasonal farmers around metro areas who are losing out because they really can &apos;t meet the year-round demand for produce .
it &apos;s not a competition with rural farm ; it &apos;s actually <unk> .
it allies in a really positive and economically viable food system .
the goal is to meet the cities &apos; institutional demands for hospitals , senior centers , schools , daycare centers , and produce a network of regional jobs , as well .
this is smart infrastructure .
and how we manage our built environment affects the health and well-being of people every single day .
our municipalities , rural and urban , play the operational course of infrastructure -- things like waste disposal , energy demand , as well as social costs of unemployment , <unk> rates , incarceration rates and the impacts of various public health costs .
smart infrastructure can provide <unk> ways for municipalities to handle both infrastructure and social needs .
and we want to shift the systems that open the doors for people who were formerly tax <unk> to become part of the tax base .
and imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic stability .
so i &apos;m hoping you can see a little theme here .
these examples indicate a trend .
i haven &apos;t created it , and it &apos;s not happening by accident .
i &apos;m noticing that it &apos;s happening all over the country , and the good news is that it &apos;s growing .
it is an essential pillar to this country &apos;s recovery .
and i call it &quot; hometown security . &quot;
the recession has us <unk> and fearful , and there &apos;s something in the air these days that is also very empowering .
it &apos;s a realization that we are the key to our own recovery .
now is the time for us to act in our own communities where we think local and we act local .
and when we do that , our neighbors -- be they next-door , or in the next state , or in the next country -- the sum of the local is the global .
hometown security means rebuilding our natural defenses , putting people to work , restoring our natural systems .
hometown security means creating wealth here at home , instead of destroying it overseas .
tackling social and environmental problems at the same time with the same solution yields great cost savings , wealth generation and national security .
many great and inspiring solutions have been generated across america .
the challenge for us now is to identify and support countless more .
now , hometown security is about taking care of your own , but it &apos;s not like the old saying , &quot; charity begins at home . &quot;
i recently read a book called &quot; love leadership &quot; by john hope <unk> .
and it &apos;s about leading in a world that really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear .
and reading that book made me <unk> that theory because i need to explain what i mean by that .
see , my dad was a great , great man in many ways .
he grew up in the segregated south , escaped <unk> and all that during some really hard times , and he provided a really stable home for me and my siblings and a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times .
but , like all of us , he had some problems .
and his was gambling , compulsively .
to him that phrase , &quot; charity begins at home , &quot; meant that my <unk> -- or someone else &apos;s -- would just happen to coincide with his lucky day .
so you need to help him out .
and sometimes i would loan him money from my <unk> or summer jobs , and he always had the great intention of paying me back with interest , of course , after he hit it big .
he made 15,000 dollars cash and bought the house that i grew up in .
so i &apos;m not that unhappy about that .
but listen , i did feel <unk> to him , and i grew up -- then i grew up .
and i &apos;m a grown woman now , and i have learned a few things along the way .
to me , charity often is just about giving , because you &apos;re supposed to , or because it &apos;s what you &apos;ve always done , or it &apos;s about giving until it hurts .
i &apos;m about providing the means to build something that will grow and <unk> its original investment and not just require greater giving next year -- i &apos;m not trying to feed the habit .
i spent some years watching how good intentions for community empowerment , that were supposed to be there to support the community and empower it , actually left people in the same , if not worse , position that they were in before .
and i know a little bit about these issues , because , for many years , i spent a long time in the non-profit industrial complex , and i &apos;m a recovering executive director , two years clean .
but during that time , i realized that it was about projects and developing them on the local level that really was going to do the right thing for our communities .
but i really did struggle for financial support .
the greater our success , the less money came in from foundations .
and i tell you , being on the ted stage and winning a macarthur in the same exact year gave everyone the impression that i had arrived .
and by the time i &apos;d moved on , i was actually covering a third of my agency &apos;s budget deficit with speaking fees .
and i think because early on , frankly , my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time .
but since then , the park that was just a dump and was featured at a ted2006 talk became this little thing .
but i did in fact get married in it .
over here .
there goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding .
the south bronx <unk> was also just a drawing on the stage back in 2006 .
since then , we got about 50 million dollars in stimulus package money to come and get here .
and we love this , because i love construction now , because we &apos;re watching these things actually happen .
so i want everyone to understand the critical importance of shifting charity into enterprise .
hometown security is next on my <unk> list .
what we need are people who see the value in investing in these types of local enterprises , who will partner with folks like me to identify the growth trends and climate adaptation as well as understand the growing social costs of business as usual .
we need to work together to embrace and repair our land , repair our power systems and repair ourselves .
it &apos;s time to stop building the shopping malls , the prisons , the stadiums and other <unk> to all of our collective failures .
it is time that we start building living monuments to hope and possibility .
thank you very much .
majora carter : 3 stories of local <unk>
&quot; even in purely non-religious terms , homosexuality represents a misuse of the sexual faculty .
it is a pathetic little <unk> substitute for reality -- a <unk> flight from life .
as such , it deserves no compassion , it deserves no treatment as minority martyrdom , and it deserves not to be deemed anything but a pernicious sickness . &quot;
that &apos;s from time magazine in 1966 , when i was three years old .
and last year , the president of the united states came out in favor of gay marriage .
and my question is , how did we get from there to here ?
how did an illness become an identity ?
when i was perhaps six years old , i went to a shoe store with my mother and my brother .
and at the end of buying our shoes , the salesman said to us that we could each have a balloon to take home .
my brother wanted a red balloon , and i wanted a pink balloon .
my mother said that she thought i &apos;d really rather have a blue balloon .
but i said that i definitely wanted the pink one .
and she reminded me that my favorite color was blue .
the fact that my favorite color now is blue , but i &apos;m still gay -- -- is evidence of both my mother &apos;s influence and its limits .
when i was little , my mother used to say , &quot; the love you have for your children is like no other feeling in the world .
and when i was little , i took it as the greatest compliment in the world that she would say that about parenting my brother and me .
and when i was an adolescent , i thought that i &apos;m gay , and so i probably can &apos;t have a family .
and when she said it , it made me anxious .
and after i came out of the closet , when she continued to say it , it made me furious .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m gay . that &apos;s not the direction that i &apos;m headed in .
and i want you to stop saying that . &quot;
about 20 years ago , i was asked by my editors at the new york times magazine to write a piece about deaf culture .
and i was rather taken <unk> .
i had thought of deafness entirely as an illness .
those poor people , they couldn &apos;t hear .
they lacked hearing , and what could we do for them ?
and then i went out into the deaf world .
i went to deaf clubs .
i saw performances of deaf theater and of deaf poetry .
i even went to the miss deaf america contest in nashville , tennessee where people complained about that <unk> southern signing .
it felt as valid perhaps even as american culture .
and when her daughter was born , she suddenly found herself confronting questions that now began to seem quite resonant to me .
she was facing the question of what to do with this child .
should she say , &quot; you &apos;re just like everyone else but a little bit shorter ? &quot;
or should she try to construct some kind of dwarf identity , get involved in the little people of america , become aware of what was happening for dwarfs ?
and i suddenly thought , most deaf children are born to hearing parents .
those hearing parents tend to try to cure them .
most gay people are born to straight parents .
those straight parents often want them to function in what they think of as the mainstream world , and those gay people have to discover identity later on .
and here was this friend of mine looking at these questions of identity with her dwarf daughter .
and i thought , there it is again : a family that perceives itself to be normal with a child who seems to be extraordinary .
and i hatched the idea that there are really two kinds of identity .
there are vertical identities , which are passed down <unk> from parent to child .
those are things like ethnicity , frequently nationality , language , often religion .
those are things you have in common with your parents and with your children .
and while some of them can be difficult , there &apos;s no attempt to cure them .
you can argue that it &apos;s harder in the united states -- our current presidency notwithstanding -- to be a person of color .
and yet , we have nobody who is trying to ensure that the next generation of children born to african-americans and asians come out with <unk> skin and yellow hair .
there are these other identities which you have to learn from a peer group .
and i call them horizontal identities , because the peer group is the horizontal experience .
these are identities that are alien to your parents and that you have to discover when you get to see them in peers .
and those identities , those horizontal identities , people have almost always tried to cure .
and i wanted to look at what the process is through which people who have those identities come to a good relationship with them .
and it seemed to me that there were three levels of acceptance that needed to take place .
there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s family acceptance , and there &apos;s social acceptance .
and they don &apos;t always coincide .
and a lot of the time , people who have these conditions are very angry because they feel as though their parents don &apos;t love them , when what actually has happened is that their parents don &apos;t accept them .
love is something that ideally is there <unk> throughout the relationship between a parent and a child .
but acceptance is something that takes time .
one of the dwarfs i got to know was a guy named clinton brown .
when he was born , he was diagnosed with <unk> dwarfism , a very <unk> condition , and his parents were told that he would never walk , he would never talk , he would have no intellectual capacity , and he would probably not even recognize them .
and it was suggested to them that they leave him at the hospital so that he could die there quietly .
and his mother said she wasn &apos;t going to do it .
and she took her son home .
and even though she didn &apos;t have a lot of educational or financial advantages , she found the best doctor in the country for dealing with <unk> dwarfism , and she got clinton enrolled with him .
and in the course of his childhood , he had 30 major surgical procedures .
and he spent all this time stuck in the hospital while he was having those procedures , as a result of which he now can walk .
and while he was there , they sent tutors around to help him with his school work .
and he worked very hard because there was nothing else to do .
and he ended up achieving at a level that had never before been <unk> by any member of his family .
he was the first one in his family , in fact , to go to college , where he lived on campus and drove a <unk> car that <unk> his unusual body .
and his mother told me this story of coming home one day -- and he went to college nearby -- and she said , &quot; i saw that car , which you can always recognize , in the parking lot of a bar , &quot; she said .
&quot; and i thought to myself , they &apos;re six feet tall , he &apos;s three feet tall .
two beers for them is four beers for him . &quot;
she said , &quot; i knew i couldn &apos;t go in there and interrupt him , but i went home , and i left him eight messages on his cell phone . &quot;
and she said , &quot; what did i do ? i loved him , that &apos;s all .
clinton just always had that light in him .
and his father and i were lucky enough to be the first to see it there . &quot;
i &apos;m going to quote from another magazine of the &apos; 60s .
this one is from 1968 -- the atlantic monthly , voice of liberal america -- written by an important <unk> .
it is sad , yes -- dreadful . but it carries no guilt .
there &apos;s been a lot of ink given to the enormous progress that we &apos;ve made in the treatment of gay people .
the fact that our attitude has changed is in the headlines every day .
but we forget how we used to see people who had other differences , how we used to see people who were disabled , how inhuman we held people to be .
and the change that &apos;s been accomplished there , which is almost equally radical , is one that we pay not very much attention to .
one of the families i interviewed , tom and karen robards , were taken <unk> when , as young and successful new yorkers , their first child was diagnosed with down syndrome .
they thought the educational opportunities for him were not what they should be , and so they decided they would build a little center -- two classrooms that they started with a few other parents -- to educate kids with <unk>
and over the years , that center grew into something called the <unk> center , where there are now thousands upon thousands of children with intellectual disabilities who are being taught .
in the time since that atlantic monthly story ran , the life expectancy for people with down syndrome has tripled .
the experience of down syndrome people includes those who are actors , those who are writers , some who are able to live fully independently in adulthood .
the robards had a lot to do with that .
and i said , &quot; do you regret it ?
do you wish your child didn &apos;t have down syndrome ?
do you wish you &apos;d never heard of it ? &quot;
and interestingly his father said , &quot; well , for david , our son , i regret it , because for david , it &apos;s a difficult way to be in the world , and i &apos;d like to give david an easier life .
but i think if we lost everyone with down syndrome , it would be a catastrophic loss . &quot;
and karen robards said to me , &quot; i &apos;m with tom .
for david , i would cure it in an instant to give him an easier life .
we live at a point when social acceptance for these and many other conditions is on the up and up .
and yet we also live at the moment when our ability to eliminate those conditions has reached a height we never imagined before .
most deaf infants born in the united states now will receive cochlear implants , which are put into the brain and connected to a receiver , and which allow them to acquire a <unk> of hearing and to use oral speech .
a compound that has been tested in mice , <unk> , is useful in preventing the action of the achondroplasia gene .
achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism , and mice who have been given that substance and who have the achondroplasia gene , grow to full size .
there are blood tests which are making progress that would pick up down syndrome more clearly and earlier in pregnancies than ever before , making it easier and easier for people to eliminate those pregnancies , or to <unk> them .
and so we have both social progress and medical progress .
and i believe in both of them .
i believe the social progress is fantastic and meaningful and wonderful , and i think the same thing about the medical progress .
but i think it &apos;s a tragedy when one of them doesn &apos;t see the other .
we have to think about how we feel about cures altogether .
and a lot of the time the question of parenthood is , what do we <unk> in our children , and what do we cure in them ?
this is what we hear when you pray for a cure -- that your <unk> wish for us is that someday we will cease to be and strangers you can love will move in behind our faces . &quot;
it &apos;s a very extreme point of view , but it points to the reality that people engage with the life they have and they don &apos;t want to be cured or changed or eliminated .
they want to be whoever it is that they &apos;ve come to be .
one of the families i interviewed for this project was the family of dylan <unk> who was one of the perpetrators of the <unk> massacre .
it took a long time to persuade them to talk to me , and once they agreed , they were so full of their story that they couldn &apos;t stop telling it .
and the first weekend i spent with them -- the first of many -- i recorded more than 20 hours of conversation .
and on sunday night , we were all exhausted .
we were sitting in the kitchen . sue <unk> was fixing dinner .
and i said , &quot; if dylan were here now , do you have a sense of what you &apos;d want to ask him ? &quot;
and his father said , &quot; i sure do .
i &apos;d want to ask him what the hell he thought he was doing . &quot;
and sue looked at the floor , and she thought for a minute .
and then she looked back up and said , &quot; i would ask him to forgive me for being his mother and never knowing what was going on inside his head . &quot;
when i had dinner with her a couple of years later -- one of many dinners that we had together -- she said , &quot; you know , when it first happened , i used to wish that i had never married , that i had never had children .
if i hadn &apos;t gone to ohio state and crossed paths with tom , this child wouldn &apos;t have existed and this terrible thing wouldn &apos;t have happened .
i recognize the pain they caused to others , for which there can be no forgiveness , but the pain they caused to me , there is , &quot; she said .
&quot; so while i recognize that it would have been better for the world if dylan had never been born , i &apos;ve decided that it would not have been better for me . &quot;
i thought it was surprising how all of these families had all of these children with all of these problems , problems that they mostly would have done anything to avoid , and that they had all found so much meaning in that experience of parenting .
and then i thought , all of us who have children love the children we have , with their flaws .
ironically , it turns out , that it &apos;s our differences , and our negotiation of difference , that unite us .
i decided to have children while i was working on this project .
and many people were astonished and said , &quot; but how can you decide to have children in the midst of studying everything that can go wrong ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m not studying everything that can go wrong .
what i &apos;m studying is how much love there can be , even when everything appears to be going wrong . &quot;
i thought a lot about the mother of one disabled child i had seen , a severely disabled child who died through caregiver neglect .
and when his ashes were <unk> , his mother said , &quot; i pray here for forgiveness for having been twice robbed , once of the child i wanted and once of the son i loved . &quot;
and i figured it was possible then for anyone to love any child if they had the effective will to do so .
so my husband is the biological father of two children with some lesbian friends in minneapolis .
i had a close friend from college who &apos;d gone through a divorce and wanted to have children .
and so she and i have a daughter , and mother and daughter live in texas .
and my husband and i have a son who lives with us all the time of whom i am the biological father , and our surrogate for the pregnancy was laura , the lesbian mother of oliver and lucy in minneapolis .
so the shorthand is five parents of four children in three states .
and there are people who think that the existence of my family somehow <unk> or <unk> or damages their family .
and there are people who think that families like mine shouldn &apos;t be allowed to exist .
and i don &apos;t accept <unk> models of love , only additive ones .
and i believe that in the same way that we need species diversity to ensure that the planet can go on , so we need this diversity of affection and diversity of family in order to strengthen the <unk> of kindness .
the day after our son was born , the pediatrician came into the hospital room and said she was concerned .
she said that might mean that he had brain damage .
in so far as he was extending them , he was doing so <unk> , which she thought could mean that there was a tumor of some kind in action .
and he had a very large head , which she thought might indicate <unk> .
and as she told me all of these things , i felt the very center of my being pouring out onto the floor .
and i thought , here i had been working for years on a book about how much meaning people had found in the experience of parenting children who are disabled , and i didn &apos;t want to join their number .
because what i was encountering was an idea of illness .
and like all parents since the dawn of time , i wanted to protect my child from illness .
and i wanted also to protect myself from illness .
we took him to the mri machine , we took him to the cat scanner , we took this <unk> child and gave him over for an arterial blood draw .
we felt helpless .
and at the end of five hours , they said that his brain was completely clear and that he was by then extending his legs correctly .
and when i asked the pediatrician what had been going on , she said she thought in the morning he had probably had a <unk> .
but i thought how my mother was right .
i thought , the love you have for your children is unlike any other feeling in the world , and until you have children , you don &apos;t know what it feels like .
i think children had <unk> me the moment i connected <unk> with loss .
but i &apos;m not sure i would have noticed that if i hadn &apos;t been so in the thick of this research project of mine .
i &apos;d encountered so much strange love , and i fell very naturally into its <unk> patterns .
and i saw how splendor can illuminate even the most abject vulnerabilities .
during these 10 years , i had witnessed and learned the terrifying joy of unbearable responsibility , and i had come to see how it <unk> everything else .
thank you .
andrew solomon : love , no matter what
most people don &apos;t know that when i went to high school in this country -- i applied for university at a time when i was convinced i was going to be an artist and be a sculptor .
my family was wealthy , and my father believed in one thing , and that was to give us all as much education as we wanted .
and i announced i wanted to be a sculptor in paris .
and he was a clever man . he sort of said , &quot; well , that &apos;s ok , but you &apos;ve done very well in your math <unk> . &quot;
in fact , i &apos;d got an 800 . and he thought i did very well -- and i did , too -- in the arts : this was my passion .
and i thought that was the best deal in town , so i accepted it immediately .
and i decided that if i was good in art , and i was good in mathematics , i &apos;d study architecture , which was the blending of the two .
i went and told my headmaster that , at prep school .
and i said to him what i was doing , that i was going to go study architecture because it was art and mathematics put together .
he said to me something that just went completely over my head .
he said , &quot; you know , i like grey suits , and i like <unk> suits , but i don &apos;t like grey <unk> suits . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; what a turkey this guy is , &quot; and i went off to mit .
i studied architecture , then did a second degree in architecture , and then actually quickly realized that it wasn &apos;t architecture .
that really , the mixing of art and science was computers , and that that really was the place to bring both , and enjoyed a career doing that .
and probably , if i were to fill out jim <unk> &apos;s scale , i &apos;d put 100 percent on the side of the equation where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative .
and after doing this for a long time , and the media lab passing the baton on , i thought , &quot; well , maybe it &apos;s time for me to do a project .
something that would be important , but also something that would take advantage of all of these <unk> that one had . &quot;
and in the case of the media lab , knowing a lot of people , knowing people who were either executives or wealthy , and also not having , in my own case , a career to worry about anymore .
my career , i mean , i &apos;d done my career .
didn &apos;t have to worry about earning money .
didn &apos;t have to worry about what people thought about me .
never shown this picture before , and probably going to be sued for it .
it &apos;s taken at three o &apos;clock in the morning , without the permission of the company .
if you look at the picture , you &apos;ll see they &apos;re stacked up .
those are conveyor belts that go around .
this is one of the conveyor belts with the thing going by , but then you &apos;ll see the ones up above .
what happens is , they burn into flash memory the software , and then test them for a few hours .
but you &apos;ve got to have the thing moving on the assembly line , because it &apos;s constant .
so they go around in this loop , which is why you see them up there .
so this was great for us because it was a real turning point . but it goes back .
this picture was taken in 1982 , just before the ibm pc was even announced .
seymour papert and i were bringing computers to schools and developing nations at a time when it was way ahead of itself .
but one thing we learned was that these kids can absolutely jump into it just the same way as our kids do here .
and when people tell me , &quot; who &apos;s going to teach the teachers to teach the kids ? &quot;
i say to myself , &quot; what planet do you come from ? &quot;
okay , there &apos;s not a person in this room -- i don &apos;t care how techie you are -- there &apos;s not a person in this room that doesn &apos;t give their laptop or cell phone to a kid to help them <unk> it . ok ?
we all need help , even those of us who are very seasoned .
this picture of seymour -- 25 years ago . seymour made a very simple observation in 1968 , and then basically presented it in 1970 -- april 11 to be precise -- called &quot; teaching children thinking . &quot;
what he observed was that kids who write computer programs understand things differently , and when they <unk> the programs , they come the closest to learning about learning .
that was very important , and in some sense , we &apos;ve lost that .
kids don &apos;t program enough and boy , if there &apos;s anything i hope this brings back , it &apos;s programming to kids .
it &apos;s really important . using applications is ok , but programming is absolutely fundamental .
this is being launched with three languages in it : squeak , logo , and a third , that i &apos;ve never even seen before .
the point being , this is going to be very , very intensive on the programming side .
this photograph is very important because it &apos;s much later .
and these kids had their laptops . but it was really what <unk> this , plus the influence of joe and others . we started one laptop per child .
this is the same village in cambodia , just a couple of months ago .
these kids are real pros . there were just 7,000 machines out there being tested by kids . being a nonprofit is absolutely fundamental .
everybody advised me not to be a nonprofit , but they were all wrong .
and the reason being a nonprofit is important is actually <unk> .
there are many reasons , but the two that merit the little bit of time is : one , the clarity of purpose is there . the moral purpose is clear .
i can see any head of state , any executive i want , at any time , because i &apos;m not selling laptops . ok ? i have no shareholders .
whether we sell , it doesn &apos;t make any difference whatsoever .
the clarity of purpose is absolutely critical . and the second is very counterintuitive -- you can get the best people in the world .
if you look at our professional services , including search firms , including communications , including legal services , including banking , they &apos;re all pro bono . and it &apos;s not to save money .
we &apos;ve got money in the bank . it &apos;s because you get the best people .
you get the people who are doing it because they believe in the mission , and they &apos;re the best people .
we couldn &apos;t afford to hire a cfo . we put out a job description for a cfo at zero salary , and we had a queue of people .
and while this machine in some sense is silly , in retrospect , it actually served a very important purpose .
that <unk> crank was remembered by everybody .
everybody remembered the <unk> crank . it &apos;s different .
it was getting its power in a different way . it &apos;s kind of childlike .
even though this wasn &apos;t the direction we went because the crank -- it really is stupid to have it on board , by the way .
in spite of what some people in the press don &apos;t get it , didn &apos;t understand it , we didn &apos;t take it off because we didn &apos;t want to do -- having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want .
you want a separate thing , like the <unk> <unk> .
i didn &apos;t bring one with me , but they really work much better <unk> .
and then , i could tell you lots about the laptop , but i decided on just four things .
that the reason that you want to be below two watts is that &apos;s roughly what you can generate with your upper body .
<unk> display -- that sunlight display &apos;s fantastic .
we were using it at lunch today in the sunlight , and the more sunlight the better .
and that was really critical . the mesh network , it &apos;ll become commonplace .
and of course , &quot; rugged &quot; goes without saying .
and the reason i think design matters isn &apos;t because i wanted to go to art school .
and by the way , when i graduated from mit , i thought the worst and <unk> thing to do would be to go to paris for six years .
so , i didn &apos;t do that . but design matters for a number of reasons .
the most important being that it is the best way to make an inexpensive product .
most people make inexpensive products by taking cheap design , cheap labor , cheap components , and making a cheap laptop .
and , in english , the word &quot; cheap &quot; has a double meaning , which is really appropriate , because it &apos;s cheap , in the <unk> sense , as well as inexpensive .
and i can race through these and save a lot of time because yves and i obviously didn &apos;t compare notes .
these are his slides , and so i don &apos;t have to talk about them .
it wasn &apos;t just to kind of make it cute , because somebody -- you know , good design is very important .
yves showed one of the <unk> devices .
it &apos;s a lot of stuff that goes behind these . these can talk to each other .
if you &apos;re in a desert , they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart .
if you &apos;re in the jungle , it &apos;s about 500 meters . so if a kid bicycles home , or walks a few miles , they &apos;re going to be off the grid , so to speak .
they &apos;re not going to be near another laptop , so you have to nail these onto a tree , and sort of , get it .
you don &apos;t call <unk> or sprint . you build your own network .
and that &apos;s very important , the user interface .
we are launching with 18 keyboards . english is by far the minority .
i &apos;m willing to suspect some of you hadn &apos;t even heard of them before .
is there anybody in the room , one person , unless you work with olpc , is there anybody in the room that can tell me what language the keyboard is that &apos;s on the screen ? there &apos;s only one hand -- so you get it .
yes , you &apos;re right . he &apos;s right . it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s ethiopian . in ethiopia , there &apos;s never been a keyboard .
there is no keyboard standard because there &apos;s no market .
and this is the big difference .
again , when you &apos;re a nonprofit , you look at children as a mission , not as a market .
so we went to ethiopia , and we helped them make a keyboard .
and this will become the standard ethiopian keyboard .
so what i want to end with is sort of what we &apos;re doing to roll it out .
and we changed strategy completely . i decided at the beginning -- it was a pretty good thing to decide in the beginning , it &apos;s not what we &apos;re doing now -- is to go to six countries .
big countries , one of them is not so big , but it &apos;s rich .
here &apos;s the six . we went to the six , and in each case the head of state said he would do it , he &apos;d do a million .
we thought , this is exactly the right strategy , get it out , and then the little countries could sort of <unk> on these big countries .
and so i went to each of those countries at least six times , met with the head of state probably two or three times .
in each case , got the ministers , went through a lot of the stuff .
this was a period in my life where i was traveling 330 days per year .
not something you &apos;d envy or want to do .
in the case of libya , it was a lot of fun meeting gaddafi in his tent .
the camel smells were unbelievable .
so we went to smaller ones . uruguay , bless their hearts .
small country , not so rich . president said he &apos;d do it , and guess what ?
he did do it . the tender had nothing in it that related to us , nothing specific about <unk> , <unk> , low-power , but just a vanilla laptop proposal .
when it was announced that they were going to do every child in uruguay , the first 100,000 , boom , went to olpc .
the next day -- the next day , not even 24 hours had passed -- in peru , the president of peru said , &quot; we &apos;ll do 250 . &quot; and boom , a little domino effect .
the president of rwanda stepped in and said he would do it .
the president of ethiopia said he would do it .
and boom , boom , boom . the president of mongolia .
and so what happens is , these things start to happen with these countries -- still not enough .
we thought that was a good time to announce it .
launched it on the 12 of november .
we said it would be just for a short period until the 26 . we &apos;ve extended it until the 31 .
and the &quot; give one , get one &quot; program is really important because it got a lot of people absolutely interested .
the first day it was just wild . and then we said , &quot; well , let &apos;s get people to give many . not just one , and get one , but maybe give 100 , give 1,000 . &quot; and that &apos;s where you come in .
and that &apos;s where i think it &apos;s very important . i don &apos;t want you all to go out and buy 400 dollars worth of laptops . okay ? do it , but that &apos;s not going to help . okay ?
if everybody in this room goes out tonight and orders one of these things for 400 dollars , whatever it is , 300 people in the room doing it -- yeah , great .
i want you do something else .
and it &apos;s not to go out and buy 100 or 1,000 , though , i invite you to do that , and 10,000 would be even better .
tell people about it ! it &apos;s got to become viral , ok ?
use your mailing lists . people in this room have extraordinary mailing lists .
get your friends to give one , get one .
and if each one of you sends it to 300 or 400 people , that would be fantastic .
i won &apos;t dwell on the pricing at all .
just to say that when you do the &quot; give one , get one , &quot; a lot of press is a bit about , &quot; they didn &apos;t make it , it &apos;s <unk> dollars , it &apos;s not 100 . &quot;
it will be 100 in two years . it will go below 100 .
but it was the countries that wanted it to go up , and we let them push it up for all sorts of reasons . so what you can do -- i &apos;ve just said it . don &apos;t just give one , get one .
i just want to end with one last one . this one is not even <unk> old , or maybe it &apos;s <unk> .
the first kids got their laptops . they got them by ship , and i &apos;m talking now about 7,000 , 8,000 at a time went out this week .
they went to uruguay , peru , mexico .
we &apos;re selling a billion cell phones worldwide this year .
but a million a month in <unk> is a big number .
and the world production today , everybody combined , making laptops , is five million a month . so i &apos;m standing here telling you that sometime next year , we &apos;re going to make 20 percent of the world production .
and if we do that , there are going to be a lot of lucky kids out there .
and we hope if you have eg two years from now , or whenever you have it again , i won &apos;t have bad breath , and i will be invited back , and will have , hopefully by then , maybe 100 million out there to children .
thank you .
nicholas negroponte : one laptop per child , two years on
nicholas negroponte talks about how one laptop per child is doing , two years in . speaking at the eg conference while the first <unk> laptops roll off the production line , he <unk> the controversies and <unk> to the goals of this far-reaching project .
i , like many of you , am one of the two billion people on earth who live in cities .
and there are days -- i don &apos;t know about the rest of you guys -- but there are days when i palpably feel how much i rely on other people for pretty much everything in my life .
and some days , that can even be a little scary .
but what i &apos;m here to talk to you about today is how that same interdependence is actually an extremely powerful social infrastructure that we can actually harness to help heal some of our deepest civic issues , if we apply open source collaboration .
a couple of years ago , i read an article by new york times writer michael pollan in which he argued that growing even some of our own food is one of the best things that we can do for the environment .
now at the time that i was reading this , it was the middle of the winter and i definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt in my new york city apartment .
so i was basically just willing to settle for just reading the next wired magazine and finding out how the experts were going to figure out how to solve all these problems for us in the future .
but that was actually exactly the point that michael pollan was making in this article -- was it &apos;s precisely when we hand over the responsibility for all these things to specialists that we cause the kind of messes that we see with the food system .
so , i happen to know a little bit from my own work about how nasa has been using hydroponics to explore growing food in space .
and you can actually get optimal nutritional yield by running a kind of high-quality liquid soil over plants &apos; root systems .
but i can offer some natural light and year-round climate control .
fast-forward two years later : we now have window farms , which are vertical , <unk> platforms for <unk> indoors .
now light and temperature vary with each window &apos;s <unk> , so a window farm requires a farmer , and she must decide what kind of crops she is going to put in her window farm , and whether she is going to feed her food organically .
back at the time , a window farm was no more than a technically complex idea that was going to require a lot of testing .
so i decided that , instead of creating a product , what i was going to do was open this up to a whole bunch of co-developers .
the first few systems that we created , they kind of worked .
we were actually able to grow about a salad a week in a typical new york city apartment window .
and we were able to grow cherry tomatoes and <unk> , all kinds of stuff .
but the first few systems were these leaky , loud <unk> that martha stewart would definitely never have approved .
so to bring on more co-developers , what we did was we created a social media site on which we published the designs , we explained how they worked , and we even went so far as to point out everything that was wrong with these systems .
