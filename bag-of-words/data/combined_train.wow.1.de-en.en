that &apos;s what we do for most problems -- in math and physics , even in social policy -- we slice them into smaller , more manageable problems .
i had never swum in water of minus 1.7 degrees before , because it &apos;s just impossible to train in those types of conditions .
if i do like you , i give you one cow and many other things and we become friends .
so , kind of a weird combination of high-tech and low-tech .
let &apos;s begin by winding the timeline back 13.7 billion years , to the beginning of time .
if i was tired , i drank more espressos .
jim fallon : exploring the mind of a killer
if it is the case , ladies and gentlemen -- and it is -- that we are now locked together in a way that has never been quite the same before , then it &apos;s also the case that we share a destiny with each other .
and then the second step is to say , &quot; the situation is admittedly dangerous , but only for a short time . &quot;
this is people designing their own experiences .
hello .
e : happy birthday to you .
as a continent , here are our priorities .
well , as an environmentalist , we would rather that didn &apos;t happen .
she didn &apos;t speak to me for a very long time , because she thought i &apos;d let my family down .
now , put it this way : what ways of thinking about justice and morality underlie the arguments we have over marriage ?
think about how powerful that is if you &apos;re trying to encourage fuel efficiency .
and none of those problems could i have dealt with , but i have a really bright research team .
he said , &quot; long story .
when it came to our atmosphere , however , it wasn &apos;t that much of a joke over the long term , because it turned out that we were losing oxygen , quite a lot of oxygen .
it &apos;s in that context that i rescue children .
and i go to see a famous magician and proudly ask him , &quot; well what do you think ? &quot;
i grew up at a time when iconic actors from kuwait , syria , egypt used laughter to unite the region , just as football can .
in my husband &apos;s homeland in the highlands of sulawesi island in eastern indonesia , there is a community of people that experience death not as a singular event but as a gradual social process .

he wanted a bigger band .
&quot; i &apos;m coming . &quot; italian hand signals follow .
audience : fold . js : really loud .
essentially it &apos;s propaganda .
it &apos;s the same for the first two parts of the sequence .
it &apos;s freezing cold , and that thin air really gets you .
and i looked at it , just said , &quot; yuck , &quot; and go and work on the other side of the island .
my parents were fanatics about learning , and i &apos;ll come back to that a little bit later .
and then , 15 years after looking at linux and figuring out how the community worked , he said , &quot; i think i know how to write a version control system for free people . &quot;
what i have here is a cinder block that we &apos;ve coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material .
i don &apos;t know of one in the world , and the opportunity is there to transform our experience in our cities .
we are now not just reading genomes ; we are writing them .
and this is one of many ways that we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period .
got a good pilot , brian allen , to operate it , and finally , succeeded . but unfortunately , about 65,000 dollars was spent on the project .
when i came home off that elephant , do you know what the most amazing part was ?
so that was a factor-100 saving .
and i think that is really the nature of architecture .
we have almost 14 million roots .
if you don &apos;t get an opening shock , you don &apos;t get a parachute -- you &apos;ve got a whole new problem set .
and it &apos;s even cruel to think of anything like this .
in cleveland , there &apos;s burnham mall , on the left .
for instance , this is herbert with his grandmother .
and social business needs markets , and there are some issues for which you just can &apos;t develop the kind of money measures that you need for a market .
we get people coming to the foundation all the time .
what did you want to be when you were little ? do you love what you do ?
by the way , the secret is not to go to sleep until you &apos;ve written your words for the day .
now , it &apos;s hard to program a robot to do delicate things like this , but it turns out my colleague , pieter abbeel , who &apos;s here at berkeley , has develeloped a new set of techniques for teaching robots from example .
artificial retinas , the ability to put these arrays on the back of the eyeball and allow the blind to see .
you don &apos;t have that kind of fine control with conventional leather .
it &apos;s a great source of stem cells .
so we &apos;re zooming in here just to show you a little bit of it .
i imagined in my head , a kind of long line of individuals that were never going away , that would always be with us .
the point is that education doesn &apos;t actually work by teaching you things .
i showed him and maria a zooplankton trawl from the gyre north of hawaii with more plastic than plankton .
but the dirty production , the burning of toxins , the lack of environmental standards in asia is actually creating so much dirty air pollution it &apos;s coming across the ocean and has erased our gains here in california .
rainfall is up .
this is cuba , and this is the recycling of a squeaky toy as a bicycle bell , and this is a raincoat that is made out of rice sacks .
i &apos;ve tried to work out which is bigger , and it &apos;s almost impossible .
when my father and i started a company to 3d print human tissues and organs , some people initially thought we were a little crazy .
there are words that we &apos;re truly afraid of .
we all need help , even those of us who are very seasoned .
i think that something needs to be done about this .
so some people got this slip of paper and five dollars .
and these people , a handful of people , have been working for 20 years , looking for particles that may or may not exist .
so an x-ray comes in in the diagram on the left and it knocks out an electron from the inner shell of an atom .
now , if you think about how our world got so accelerated , the usual suspects rear their heads .
after the war , you tear that up , you put 100,000 troops in europe for over 40 years .
read that great piece in the new yorker about how our echo boomers , 19 to 25 , over in iraq taught each other how to do sys admin work , over the internet in chat rooms .
it &apos;s actually functioning as a paddle even though it &apos;s interacting with a surface that we normally think of as a solid .
and i would like it to be ethiopia .
and in fact , i think we &apos;re even wrong when we talk about cancer as a thing .
so , i got my hands on that chemical , filled the sink up with it , and stuck my face in the sink and tried to breathe that in , which was really impossible .
they didn &apos;t have sparklers . but , they -- -- you can make up rules , but they have to relate only to the things that you &apos;ve been able to demonstrate .
this destructive power takes many different forms .
but whichever it turns out to be , there is one thing i &apos;m sure of : the journey will be full of surprises .
the combination of spin , on the one hand , and the internet on the other .
it hits very close to home .
there &apos;s a long history in astronomy of unlikely things turning out to be there . and i mean , the finest example of that was radio astronomy as a whole .
it &apos;s called &quot; helios &quot; -- helios from the sun .
that &apos;s great . i need help with this one .
it &apos;s a kiva , and larry &apos;s putting some water in there , and it works much better than a fish .
who are the cast of characters ? what &apos;s the costume ?

they really enjoyed each other &apos;s company .
the storm was so fierce that we had to lay , fully dressed , fully equipped , laid out on the tent floor to stop the tent from blowing off the mountain .
thirty-five to 50 percent of women forget oral rehydration therapy , they are increasing -- they are actually making their child more likely to die through their actions .
the worse that it is for us , the better that it is for this fundraising .
it &apos;s pretty extraordinary .
you know it &apos;s going to really transform how we feel about travel , and it will also , i think , enhance our freedom of mobility .
well , there &apos;s a lot of know-how out there .
well , why don &apos;t we first say to those helping us out , &quot; don &apos;t be shy about infrastructure .
and let &apos;s understand : this is not an incremental sort of change .
first thing to notice is , half of them do not even have access to a 401 plan .
and the reason he would do that kind of thing is because he understood it feels so much better to stand there and say , &quot; here in my own little world , i am a god , i understand everything .
this was going to be superman , or it wasn &apos;t worth my time or their money .
and this is what we discovered .
put it in the shower , or in the closet , but not in the foyer .
what do we typically finance ?
so it &apos;s not multi-touch as a whole that &apos;s patented .
thank you . it &apos;s really an honor and a privilege to be here spending my last day as a teenager .
it stands for mutually assured destruction .
so , i met the man , walked in his office , and saw these posters and magazine covers of people he has coached .
how can we tell this woman that she ain &apos;t going to have a washing machine ?
meat is a very different story because , of course , animals could walk into the city .
because i want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible .
it turned out , in every single case , they came out of the indian educational system .
i had a kid one day come into my class having been stabbed the night before .
i suggested it and people said , &quot; no no no .
however , an 18 year-old trying to start a school is not easy unless you have a big patron or a big supporter .
so we all get a very distorted picture of reality .
the way we transmit wireless data is by using electromagnetic waves -- in particular , radio waves .
and she goes inside , and woman comes up to her and says , &quot; welcome to mothers2mothers .

i was born in 1976 .
it was very obvious , from the very beginning , that she was a leader .
here &apos;s another one . this is from a game called &quot; food force , &quot; which is a game that teaches children how to run a refugee camp .
when we measure corporate performances , we don &apos;t include our impacts on nature and what our business costs society .
if you think that , plato &apos;s not your guy .
and this was the first prototype in korea , as we &apos;re dealing with a dynamic envelope , and then the same characteristic of the fabric .
aside from alex ross &apos;s style , which is very glamorous , one thing about superman is he makes you believe that a man can fly .
and the book is called &quot; the garden of priapus . &quot;
and the real problem with the global supply chain is that it &apos;s supranational .
because she has been suffering from a superbug called c. diff , and it &apos;s resistant to antibiotics in many cases .
but julián le barón keeps working and he has been mobilizing communities in chihuahua for over a year .
working on projects that actually have visible impacts , like a book for a deceased german artist whose widow came to us with the requirement to make her late husband famous .
so , we &apos;re talking about things like inflatable liners that can conform to the complex topological shape on the inside of a cave , foamed-in-place airlocks to deal with this complex topology , various ways of getting breathing gases made from the intrinsic materials of these bodies .
prior to world war ii , they were making 1000 planes a year .
they &apos;ve been watching too much &quot; terminator . &quot;
human societies got larger , denser , more interconnected .
i usually say to people , when they say , &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
and they had those expectations because agent metaphors imply the deliberate action of a living thing pursuing a goal .
people were walking around obsessed .
so this is a different approach .
but when you &apos;re down here , where the psycho milts of the world are adding one photo at a time , that &apos;s institution as obstacle .
by now i know you &apos;re dying to know what it is and where you can get one .
girl : holly .
we &apos;re comfortable with it needing some tweaks , but we want to keep it .
it wasn &apos;t till -- huygens had two things .
because simple answers may emerge .

a victor in a thousand contests , three great civil rights laws , medicare , aid to education .
these kids did a little graffiti on their desks , and then they signed up for two extra courses .
you can see easily that all the oily water just goes over the back of the boom .

the russians bombarded grozny constantly for weeks , killing mainly the civilians who were still trapped inside .
first , they tend to work in markets where people make one , two , three dollars a day and they are making all of their decisions within that income level .
we simply couldn &apos;t capture it on video .
but he says that he has yet to experience someone who became more aware of their body , in all its frailty and its grace , without , at the same time , becoming more compassionate towards all of life .

so i was arrested quite early in stalin &apos;s purges , and spent 16 months in a russian prison .
and this is a sheet of acrylic infused with colorless light-diffusing particles .
one day my father introduced me to my sister .
i mean , you have the typical european cities , with a dense urban core , good public transportation mostly , not a lot of road capacity .
we exercise these prior to implantation .
another reason is our american emphasis on the virtues of self-reliance and independence , so we instinctively look down on older people who are no longer self-reliant and independent .
this peers , inc. concept is in a very difficult and complex realm .
and here &apos;s this really sophisticated technology coming down the road , all these associated social , moral , ethical questions , and we scientists are just lousy at explaining to the public just exactly what it is we &apos;re doing in those labs .
finally , we have contextual communication .
so unrealistic optimism can lead to risky behavior , to financial collapse , to faulty planning .
here &apos;s the data for 1,100 canadians .
case in point , einstein .
that was the one that i studied .
i felt this tap on my shoulder , and i turned around to see this giant girl in a hoodie sweatshirt emerge from the crowd .
that &apos;s where i got reacquainted with abraham maslow &apos;s &quot; hierarchy of needs . &quot;
however , it &apos;s hard sometimes to remember the extent of that urbanization .
number two , very quickly : how do you solve global climate change when we don &apos;t even have a national energy policy in this country and when gridlock in congress seems to be the norm ?
so when the storm is coming up , it drives a pin into the ground .
it &apos;s reached about seven-and-a-half million human feelings now .
one is well known : untestable theories .
so this is one that they found , they called the knife , the carnival , the boston shuffler , twilight .
they scan each individual x-ray .
no ? now ?
i &apos;m talking about losing it in the same way that we lost the dinosaurs : actually losing it , never to be seen again .
and then you finally get squatter homes like this , which is built on the suburban model .
and they &apos;re creating -- you can think of it as a kind of wallpaper .
so , that pathologist is just like looking at this plastic bottle .
okay , now this gives one a little pause .
chad showed me how easy it is to purchase and fly aerial drones .
let &apos;s not talk about breastfeeding .
bless you . thank you very much .
we are losing species from the earth faster than the dinosaurs disappeared , and leading that loss are amphibians .
music for me was more than a passion . it was obsession .
there &apos;s five to 10 times more wind available worldwide than we need for all the world .
the paper apologized but said it never runs photos of women .

so the college works following the lifestyle and workstyle of mahatma gandhi .
they would get dentures , and if you got dentures , you weren &apos;t going to be able to eat corn-on-the-cob , you &apos;ll eat mush for the rest of your life .
you can see that it &apos;s like three billion missing here .
zoom into it and see where it was taken .
i used to work , also while at microsoft , at a leading restaurant in seattle , so i do a lot of cooking .
&quot; can the brain build such a perception ? &quot;
at first , we were safe in the camp .
this is the picture taken at eight kilometers , ok ? again , the shoreline .
then we &apos;d had 100 years of modern rain science , and that had accelerated desertification , as we first discovered in africa and then confirmed in the united states , and as you see in this picture of land managed by the federal government .
these are potential sources for high-speed data transmission .
but we can push this idea further .
another one was an interactive project where , when you moved the mouse over the letters of &quot; happy mom day , &quot; it reveals a special happy mother &apos;s day slogan .
god cannot be glamorous because god is omnipotent , omniscient -- too far above us .
you know , 20 years before it was still , &quot; ask not what you can do , &quot; but with reagan , it &apos;s , &quot; that &apos;s where , there &apos;s nancy and i , &quot; that kind of language .
let &apos;s take meritocracy .
&quot; oh yeah . &quot; hundred percent .
so i could do more large-scale projects .
no , i think that &apos;s wrong .
the rocket engine begins .
the reason is there &apos;s a separate pathway going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers , and that &apos;s not been cut by the accident .
they all showed this strange sort of skating gait that they adopted once the bridge started to move .
they don &apos;t want legal distinctions between legal and illegal sharing .

in the 1930s , if any of you wanted to make a movie , you had to work for warner brothers or rko because who could afford a movie set and lighting equipment and editing equipment and scoring and more ?
he kept it to himself for 30 years .
they thought you just wear out , there &apos;s nothing you can do about it -- kind of like an old shoe .
this is the only equation in the talk by the way .
20 billion dollars of this material is produced every year , in everything from building materials to surfboards to coffee cups to table tops .
the tricky part is the implementation .
rodney mullen : that &apos;s a good question .
so this work was a real technical challenge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our works , over years to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics .
in a second i &apos;m going to show you a slow motion of a single firefly so that you can get a sense . this is a single frame .
ghanaian economist george ayittey unleashes a torrent of controlled anger toward corrupt leaders in africa -- and calls on the &quot; cheetah generation &quot; to take back the continent .
of course , there were kids who had to .
and it doesn &apos;t even get tired of grading the same work multiple times , we &apos;ve seen that in many of the examples that i &apos;ve shown you .
martin seligman : the new era of positive psychology
this is looking directly across the street from where they were standing .
because when people all share values , when people all share morals , they become a team , and once you engage the psychology of teams , it shuts down open-minded thinking .
you know , innovators , the entrepreneurs out there , you know that when you &apos;re going for a goal , the first thing you have to do is believe that you can do it yourself .
they are more expensive in places like north america .
we &apos;re doing great . we &apos;re doing fine .
because it &apos;s actually not that hideous .
a retired school teacher , there she is with a social security administrator .
it &apos;s a human and technological revolution .
but he did have one suggestion .
milo : i could just squish it .
hourly simulations show that largely or wholly renewable grids can deliver highly reliable power when they &apos;re forecasted , integrated and diversified by both type and location .
but that in fact seemed to be the case .
now , this is really special cork , and this cork is what &apos;s going to protect us from the violent atmospheric entry that we &apos;re about to experience .
now , why is this story important ?
today i &apos;ll be focusing on a major problem that is linked to phosphorus .
the exception was japan .
which is why phil morrison calls seti , &quot; the archaeology of the future . &quot;
and one of the major things we can do we &apos;ve talked a bit about here today is moving the curve to the left .
this first challenge is what i refer to as the persuasion challenge .
but you will remain one of the most important superpowers , and the most hopeful superpower , for the time to be .
autism creates itself .
let &apos;s look at a couple of quick examples .
my sister was struggling to get through undergrad .
he changed exactly one word : &quot; heidi &quot; to &quot; howard . &quot;
this is a photographer &apos;s light box application .
another irony , the double irony is that on the figs and the olives , eduardo can make more money selling those than he can on the foie gras .
now here we go in to the -- la la la , off to work .
and how do we do that ?
and i think this is actually a shrimp that &apos;s releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water .
because nobody &apos;s ever climbed an 8,000-meter peak without oxygen that doesn &apos;t have an ace gene .
the decompiculture society shares a vision of a cultural shift , from our current culture of death denial and body preservation to one of decompiculture , a radical acceptance of death and decomposition .
now visual expression is just one form of culture integration .

they all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism .
now , what we were trying to understand was , is this true ?
similarly , when you put motor output on movement output , it &apos;s extremely noisy .
and probably the easiest way to show you that , is to show you this graph .
so , they poke at it and peck at it and whatnot .
but i realized that what i really needed to know i couldn &apos;t get from training courses .
halfway up the bank , a young teenage elephant came in behind her , and he propped his trunk underneath her , and he began to shovel her up the bank .
people are less happy when they &apos;re mind-wandering no matter what they &apos;re doing . for example , people don &apos;t really like commuting to work very much .
we imagine there are only two choices : either full engagement and troop deployment or total isolation .
sb : thank you . i scared myself .
now , none of you is a martian . how did you do that ?
when ugly jerry was around , jerry was popular .
and i believe dean kamen presented it at ted a few years ago .
the mediatheque has something like 16 stations where the public can get onto the server and look at digital artworks or also curated artworks off the web .
and i think this is largely what &apos;s behind the crisis of legitimacy in our different governments right now .
we find that if we get them out of institutions and into loving families early on , they recover their developmental delays , and go on to lead normal , happy lives .
and the man knows that he doesn &apos;t have to do any digging to get roots .
any time perspective in excess has more negatives than positives .

the first year we got nothing .
again , sanitation and water is incredibly important , but it also costs a lot of infrastructure .
it &apos;s a part of the spiritual world .
i just came to my senses , obviously .
if you look at the scene , egypt , for 30 years , had been in a downhill -- going into a downhill .
the pack stays together .
but we don &apos;t just experience them , we show them .
couldn &apos;t actually turn back very much , because if you were king a thousand years ago , while it still took hours and hours and weeks and weeks to traverse your own country , there wasn &apos;t much you were in charge of .
two percent isn &apos;t 20 percent , but in the car business , which is slow moving , that &apos;s huge ; that &apos;s arrival .
and what we &apos;re here to do is not to talk about puerto rico or the past .
votes can &apos;t go missing because then you won &apos;t find yours when you look for it .
step one : woman says , &quot; i want to have a baby . iskam baby . &quot;
we &apos;re going to have a department of something else between war and peace .
but not everything was human , and i will give you a very exciting example .
it &apos;s got a needle , like a record needle , that goes back and forth over the surface , bumps up and down , and feels the height of the first surface .
and i can look at the journey , not just the destination .
everyone &apos;s a bit psychopathic . &quot;
so , you know , by being able to write a genome and plug it into an organism , the software , if you will , changes the hardware .
ts : yeah .
and so i was surprised when i noticed one day that the conservatives had disappeared from my facebook feed .
there &apos;s really no ceremony , rituals , or rites .
it &apos;s a blind computer .
and i have a dream .
they used the same trash to form green manure .
mammography relies on differences in the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue , and we &apos;ve seen that those differences can be obscured in a dense breast .
thank you .
and all of this comes from the architecture of complexity , or the patterns of how things are connected .
what we started to do was to realize that we had to take charge and reform ourselves .
when we share ideas we all get more .
and if you find one , i will say that this is something related to seti , because naturally you can &apos;t do it .
for the past five years , i &apos;ve been taking my wife and kids to southwestern montana , where i worked as a teenager on the hay harvest . and montana , at first sight , seems like the most pristine environment in the united states .
when i &apos;m walking around an art gallery , rooms and rooms full of paintings , after about 15 or 20 minutes , i realize i &apos;m not thinking about the paintings .

marcus du sautoy : symmetry , reality &apos;s riddle
that &apos;s me getting mica .

they are losing up to 30 percent of their business with people leaving shops faster , or just turning around on the door .
it &apos;s becoming , i think , a really great institution .
this is not a product placement . it &apos;s just -- in fact , if i was coca cola , i &apos;d be pretty distressed about this -- -- but basically , this is it .
infection in india .
knowing that she wants to stick a needle in your skin and suck out your blood ? that &apos;s awful , right ?
there are nine billion humans coming our way .
and that &apos;s great when i can degrade the tissue .
and so i &apos;ve figured out , over time , the solution to the depression : you make a friend in every town and you &apos;ll never be lonely .
there is a single candle flickering in the center ; by an arrangement of reflective glasses , it reflects into infinity in all directions .
and yet , the irony is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space .
which is how i ended up having lunch with the scientologists .
but they have two types of gill structures .
there &apos;s no photoshop here .
this is a marketplace , also in kenya , toi market , lots of dealers , in almost everything you want to buy .
second , we need to create the space for what i call &quot; managed dissent . &quot;
em : thank you . that was awesome . that was really , really cool .
i said , &quot; no , i &apos;ve got the best eduction .
optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief , an intellectual posture .
first question : if i want to ask them to call up -- because they do hear them through the ear .
what will that lead to ?
the sun end was about four inches in diameter , and then it tapered over about 35 feet to about a millimeter at the earth end .
and the most important message of roots and shoots is that every single individual makes a difference .
and all those phones were in the few urban places .
ramona pierson : an unexpected place of healing

if he can see this pattern in his own brain , he can learn how to control it .
as you can see , a project evolves through a series of generations of design meetings .
we all know everybody in this room makes mistakes .

the defeated candidate gave up power and made way for ghana to move into a new democratic cycle .

they &apos;re malleable . they &apos;re volatile , and as a result , we all need to remember to be cautious , that the accuracy of our memories is not measured in how vivid they are nor how certain you are that they &apos;re correct .
when you think about it , the oceans are 75 percent of the planet .
i was a 24-year-old young engineer .
so a lot of people have heard about the wikipedia bush-kerry controversy .
yes we can . we can do it .
and i &apos;m not just talking about laws as they relate to people living with hiv , but people who are at greatest risk of infection -- people such as those who inject drugs or sex workers or transgendered persons or migrants or prisoners .
on the left hand side there is a large volcano called axial seamount .
ss : two weeks ago , aimee was up for the arthur ashe award at the espys .
so i have branded myself as a war child .
and these days , people ask me a lot , how did that feel .
i remember a few years ago , i was thinking about all this , and i went to see &quot; the sunday sport , &quot; a tabloid newspaper that i don &apos;t recommend you to start reading if you &apos;re not familiar with it already .
what happened is we had evolved an agricultural economy to a world of big business .
these are just some of the households that we &apos;ve done in the intel studies .
so that ranges from heart disease to malaria , hiv , aids , as well as other forms of cancer -- anything .
this number is small .
so low income here , high income there .
bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate , pet , will sink in seawater and not make it this far from civilization .
and so i managed to fly the balloon down through the clouds , and about 50 feet , before i hit the sea , threw myself over .

susan cain : the power of introverts
each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other .
no , what happened to us , chris , is that power , it &apos;s priced off the margin .

the world &apos;s largest and most devastating environmental and industrial project is situated in the heart of the largest and most intact forest in the world , canada &apos;s boreal forest .
i flew around the world .
and before i left the hospital , after a year of being hospitalized , i had seven ruptures of my carotid artery .
and it turns out to not be very hard .
this is morocco last year in the atlas mountains , training in preparation for some high altitude jumps .
and that &apos;s the power of storytelling .
i &apos;m not real good with math , but i was working on it .
another kind of cell , head direction cells , which i didn &apos;t mention yet , they fire like a compass according to which way you &apos;re facing .
i couldn &apos;t leave the story , and i couldn &apos;t leave the topic either , because everywhere i went i met more of these women who no one seemed to know about , or even wish to .
this was a fly by wire . it has wings .
when i spoke at ted in 1996 , reporting on my studies of the early virtual communities , i said , &quot; those who make the most of their lives on the screen come to it in a spirit of self-reflection . &quot;
women can talk .
and the artist that drew this observation test did some errors , had some mistakes -- there are more or less 12 mistakes .
takes about a minute .
we have a tool that actually helps us out in this study , and that &apos;s the fact that the universe is so incredibly big that it &apos;s a time machine , in a certain sense .
the purpose was to make a crater to excavate the material and see what was underneath the surface of this comet , which we learned quite a bit about .
so we &apos;re going to go out and swing around and look back at this .
after this awful event occurs , rocket gets to decide how she feels about it .
and the therapy is delivered continuously at home , without having to go into the hospital either periodically or continually .
in the developed world it &apos;s on average 80 kilograms per person per year , which goes up to 120 in the united states and a bit lower in some other countries , but on average 80 kilograms per person per year .
so then , once you &apos;ve done that , the next stage is to know what it is .
nothing lights up the brain like play .
upgrades the life for these geese .
so with such large , lightweight pillows , we had much less steel .
anesthesia gave surgeons the freedom to operate .
when &apos;s the last time you really enjoyed just the voice of your friend ?
and in fact , sometimes i feel a little sorry for the chicken on my dinner plate , when i think of how intense this brain system is .
took about two years , because i &apos;m looking for fat-free design .
it &apos;s next to nothing . especially designed for me .
let &apos;s see what we get there .
but more important , the pan-african student body is a continual source of strength , pride and commitment to africa .
and when i was 13 , i had a job at a dressmaker &apos;s shop sewing clothes .
he &apos;ll play it . i don &apos;t know how we &apos;ll react to it , but something will change .

recently , obama has introduced optimism at a sort of time of global financial crisis .
turn that piece of paper that you did the sketch on back over , and you &apos;ll find those 30 circles printed on the piece of paper .
so vitamin d is good for you -- it stops rickets , it prevents calcium metabolism , important stuff .
and so from social networks to sociable robots , we &apos;re designing technologies that will give us the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship .
this is the town hall for the city .
we have to figure out how to make this tradeoff between growing food and having a healthy environment work better .
that &apos;s the first time , as a teacher , that i had heard the word &quot; teach ourselves &quot; said so casually .
kb : thanks for letting me show these .
and should they ever come in contact ...
rules and incentives don &apos;t tell you how to be a good friend , how to be a good parent , how to be a good spouse , or how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer or a good teacher .
i met mandela at the arusha peace talks , and so on and so on and so on -- while i was building the case to prove whether this idea would make sense .
let us not keep them and ourselves in the dark .
today we have technology that lets us express ourselves a great deal , perhaps a little too much .
and abbreviated it to meme , just because it sounds good and made a good meme , an effective spreading meme .
rw : that &apos;s terrific . thank you .
so decades ago , not years ago , i set out to find a place in the world where i could observe dolphins underwater to try to crack the code of their communication system .
if you &apos;re wired to make deals , you make deals .
so that becomes a very powerful force for them to make their brand more elastic .
his name is dr. denis mukwege .
with a 3d visualization like this , we can not only just say voyager 1 flew by saturn .
she took over as executive director .
so i created 10 fake male profiles .
but you should be aware that its use is very much illegal in the united states .
so what seems like a very clunky product is , in fact , incredibly useful .
but then i took a trip to the national museum of natural history .
in order to do that , however , we needed to have a method of distinguishing normal from malignant , and on the left is the single normal cell , human breast , put in three-dimensional gooey gel that has extracellular matrix , it makes all these beautiful structures .
here &apos;s an example of the puzzle you &apos;re going to solve .
i can &apos;t look you in the eyes and tell you that i have a simple solution for that , but i can look you in the eyes and tell you that we can &apos;t solve any of those problems if we don &apos;t have crop diversity .
i hold out hope that we &apos;ll be able to reconcile this conflict with some sort of , some yet uninvented technology .
so what have we learned from all this ?
this is now supposed to be my bacterial cell .
you know , there &apos;s this little child who can &apos;t see , can &apos;t really understand much about the world , has no one in the family who plays an instrument , and yet he taught himself to play that .
this theory and others like it are long shots .
so , i kind of believe that we &apos;re in like the &quot; cave-painting &quot; era of computer interfaces .
so we &apos;ve got about 100,000 pieces up there .
this is an unbelievable light show .
most of you have the intuition that it &apos;s not -- you wouldn &apos;t pay that for it .
j i don &apos;t know . i guess people can see the gross disparity in force .
well , i &apos;ve got to tell you , it &apos;s just not going to be pretty .
and so the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence .
consider for example transporting goods .
three : the secret to high performance isn &apos;t rewards and punishments , but that unseen intrinsic drive -- the drive to do things for their own sake .
i &apos;ll explain what that means . we &apos;re looking at three trends .
the other assumption that you made -- and this little lesson is to show you that you will make assumptions .
this kid needs a lot of work . &quot;
as a friend of mine says , &quot; life is a series of things you &apos;re not quite ready for . &quot;
i can bring home the bacon , fry it up in the pan and never let you forget you &apos;re a man . &quot;
we have to know a little more about the world .
that is , every day , 25,000 children die of entirely preventable causes .
the actual nerve supplying the arm was severed , was cut , by say , a motorcycle accident .
this surgeon has over 3,000 hours of laparoscopic experience .
what we need is information .
and aicha started , and she said , &quot; i don &apos;t know if my son is guilty or innocent , but i want to tell you how sorry i am for what happened to your families .
this has led , in the space of only four years from the time the gene was discovered to the start of a clinical trial , to a test of that very compound .
and i couldn &apos;t wait to trip the mind fantastic .
what &apos;s important though is that writing only emerged about 5,000 years ago . so what that means is that all the people before there was any writing , every word that they ever said , every utterance disappeared . no trace . evanescent . gone .
i think we have their attention .
and i would like to say that life was totally easy with them .
and the strangler says very matter-of-factly , &quot; oh no . if i &apos;d felt the distress , i could not have done it .
the computer learned what the monkey brain did to move its arm in various ways .
so i took the food supply of every single country and i compared it to what was actually likely to be being consumed in each country .
all the peoples that the babylonians had repressed and removed will go home , and they &apos;ll take with them their gods .
while i was doing that work , my mom and my dad , they were looking at it and they said , &quot; why do you deal with negative subjects all the time ? &quot;
i had been steeped in the intelligence on iraq and its wmd , and my testimony to the inquiry said three things : that the government exaggerated the intelligence , which was very clear in all the years i &apos;d read it .
and my answer to kimberly was that what i &apos;m sending is none of your business , and it should be none of your government &apos;s business either .
we now deliver food in over 30 countries over cell phones , transforming even the presence of refugees in countries , and other ways .
there &apos;s a railroad track .
jh : so note how bradley &apos;s petty , moralistic self just dies on the way up the staircase .
i think it has to start with us .
the second question is , who are you connecting ?
the best four minutes of my entire life were those in the olympic stadium .
let &apos;s focus on the conversations between our friends and our family and our coworkers and our loved ones .
300 to 500 million cases are reported .
it &apos;s quite likely in an audience this size this won &apos;t happen to anybody here .
this is a fundamental question that most of us are asking .
why am i asking all of these business questions , instead of just showing them pages ?
our dream is for our partners , our husbands , not to be given to us because of a horoscope , because they &apos;ve been tested for hiv . &quot;
this is not like that . i &apos;m much more like scotty .
we need to understand software as well as just giving someone hardware .
let &apos;s go .
okay . right .
that &apos;s why you need not just be training in one specialty , but also acquire breadth in other fields , related to and even distant from your own initial choice .
they back then , actually , made fortune cookies using very much the similar kind of irons that we saw back in kyoto .
i was in a bit of a spot .
everybody gets involved . it &apos;s just a matter of when the inevitable happens .
i experienced this , not so much as a geographical shift , as a linguistic one .
these are tricky puzzles because your first instinct is to say &quot; tulip , &quot; and then you have to unstick yourself .
we actually just got &quot; middle class &quot; in colorado springs , colorado , but you get the picture .
on the left , i &apos;ve plotted the scores for liberals ; on the right , those for conservatives ; in the middle , the moderates .
and the answer is zero .
both countries are in asia .
it &apos;s not that i didn &apos;t have help , but honestly , i sort of led , i was the team leader .
so that &apos;s no great surprise .
how had i spent my valuable time ?
instead , we prefer these really dazzling technological solutions , which cost a huge amount of money .
and humans dispersed -- not once , but twice .
it &apos;s been known for a long time , you can &apos;t tickle yourself as well as other people can .
if you look at their feet , they have leaf-like structures called linalae with millions of hairs .
for instance , this is another student of mine , susan jackson from australia , who did work with some of the leading athletes in the world .
i grew up amongst those animals .
it doesn &apos;t radiate .
it was very much uncontrollable , and in a certain sense , it seemed to be the extreme of complexity , just a mess , a mess and a mess .
should we do serious research on this topic ?
so , the chinese are very good at these puns and alternative wording and even memes .
and the thing i &apos;m really trying to do is enabling people to have more rich kinds of interactive experiences .
any claim that al qaeda had to being protectors of islam against the western crusaders was drowned in the blood of iraqi muslims .
but the geneticist professor steve jones describes how unilever actually did solve this problem -- trial and error , variation and selection .
and they all took the spotlight , even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to .
it &apos;s about helping people to build lives of dignity , stability , economic autonomy , citizenship .
so it makes sense to want your enemy to be happy , because they &apos;ll stop being your enemy because that &apos;s too much trouble .
and conversely , we older people are not fluent in the technologies essential for surviving in modern society .
there are many kinds of interviews . we know them .
so now -- i always ask , why do i put myself in this position ?
these are very compelling , vivid sensations .
and then , over time , we were able to bring down the cost significantly to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out .
and so i just think , they got their lecture to go to .
so i &apos;m not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up .
so say on the order of tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands of molecules will come together to form a large structure that didn &apos;t exist before .
and we got these overlapping circles . and we found only 173 genes common to all 13 organisms .
so , maybe spraying ddt on crops is a really bad idea .
she said that , first of all , that she didn &apos;t know how to contact me .
they &apos;re exotic . they &apos;re experimental .
wise he was , indeed , but he also had a wonderful sense of humor .
i would pass their sheet of paper .
but immediately the system goes like , &quot; what kind of dumb piece of code was this ?
the final stages , when i ran the samples through a high-pressure liquid chromatography mass spectrometer , which separated the compounds and analyzed the chemicals and told me exactly how much carcinogens i had in my chicken .
she said , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
the strange one looks likes this : that we live in a three-dimensional world .
it has no fresh water that it &apos;s able to drink , but it drinks water out of fog .
and she said , &quot; well , something very weird was happening .
he was an early talker .
but jefferson wasn &apos;t quite right , was he ?
he has this line where he says , you know , you &apos;re going to put up a link there , if you see a link , somebody decided to put it there .
and in the current iran , zoroastrians and christians have guaranteed places in the iranian parliament , something to be very , very proud of .
what you &apos;re going to learn is this .
the next step is to learn the capability to make yourself a scientist .
cancer exploded the wall of my disconnection .
and these decisions affect africa .
so i &apos;ve joined a growing band of people that try to make molecular spells using dna . we use dna because it &apos;s cheaper .
and this virtual object takes 200 real people about 56 days of real time to build , plus countless thousands of hours of effort before that .
but just keep staring at it .
and i said , &quot; well , what , he didn &apos;t want to hang out with the other patients ? &quot;
we then execute that on the robot , we observe what happens , then we adjust the controls using a sequence of techniques called iterative learning .
for so much of my life , i wanted something else to make me happy .
because i could go on for about two hours with evidence of people &apos;s inability to estimate odds and inability to estimate value .
so i was very excited about this .
can we roll the video ?
that one is , more or less , the same type of process .
and you can see , you go inside the family enclosure -- you go inside and here &apos;s pots in the fireplace , stacked recursively .
these are some questions that we &apos;ve yet to ask .
and he said , &quot; well , i &apos;m in truro , &quot; which is where i was , and he asked me out for supper .
it &apos;s embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the west .
one day a nasa manager comes into my office , sits down and says , &quot; can you please tell us , how do we look for life outside earth ? &quot;
how much do i stand to gain from cheating ?
and then we started a new policy -- a new policy completely different .
shame drives two big tapes -- &quot; never good enough &quot; and , if you can talk it out of that one , &quot; who do you think you are ? &quot;
we need to kind of get down and do the gritty work of reducing our dependence upon this fuel and these molecules .
and there &apos;s nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies .
it &apos;s not so much psychological , it &apos;s vascular , and nicotine makes your arteries constrict .
it expresses , but it doesn &apos;t solve , an underlying problem .
i think there &apos;s a belief that it &apos;s just impossible , that you cannot quantify the doings of mankind , that you cannot measure history .
our experience points to an amazing increase in human productivity by over 20 percent by using these plants .
china &apos;s building 300 new cities in the next 20 years .
what has happened in the last 15 years with this work ?
i &apos;m tired of you having to come here , harassing us , while your children are sleeping peacefully in your homes .
so imagine that the operators make their return by building a percentage markup into each transaction .
you can use statistics , or you can use stories .
so i met this character , steven .
this is something that we &apos;re using today to search for e.t. , and the electronics have gotten very much better too .
and the first one , and i &apos;m about to utter a heresy here , none of them exercise , at least the way we think of exercise .
this is the retiree health care benefits .
it &apos;s the end of the conversation for intelligent design creationists .
and this is something that is common to all our big cities .
and she , of course , naturally as a nine-year-old , looked at me and said quizzically , &quot; what &apos;s literacy ? &quot;
and in many places , they &apos;re there .
okay ?
they have figured out everything that &apos;s required to dismantle , take things apart , rewrite the circuitry , re-flash the firmware , do whatever you want to with the phone , and they can fix anything so quickly .
it means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have .
you don &apos;t need the 30-day waiting period .
so for ted we actually built a robot , over there , a prototype , with the tail .
so he had a handful of shrimp , maybe seven or eight shrimp , and all those other animals on the deck of the boat are bycatch .
we have .
so if you keep further down the knowledge map , we &apos;re getting into more advanced arithmetic .
it can get sideways like a rally car driver , always able to take the tightest curve , even on slippery , changing surfaces , never spinning out .
that &apos;s no problem , as most of you know , because i can just delete that dot .
so simplicity and predictability are characteristics of simple things .
and the third kind of project : something for the local environment .
and the very last one is a billboard .
30 percent of our households gave .
how can we have critical thinking without being able to quote and being able to compare what happened in the past ?
lord , i hate to hear that news .
when an artful blob of paint or two , by an artist , suggests a person -- say , one of marvin minsky &apos;s little society of mind -- do they send little painters out to fill in all the details in your brain somewhere ?
and i said , &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
for the longest time people have regarded science and humanities as being distinct .
so i hate to put a timeline on scientific innovation , but the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends .
by 1913 , these 10 countries , plus the united states , controlled vast global empires -- 58 percent of the world &apos;s territory , about the same percentage of its population , and a really huge , nearly three-quarters share of global economic output .
and you just saw motts the research engineer , there , going into the mri system , and he was wearing goggles .
and moving on to some applications developed by developers and researchers around the world , with robots and simple machines , for example -- in this case , flying a toy helicopter simply by thinking &quot; lift &quot; with your mind .
it generates 30 % of greenhouse gas emissions .
i will kill you in the name of allah , wuhahahahaha . &quot;
we had to age the teeth over time .
i had to do something .
i thought i could jazz it up a bit , have a little fun with it .
there is a compound in chocolate called phenethylamine that might be an aphrodisiac .
and i feel humbled by their strength .
kb : thank you .
the wall that kept me , elyn , professor saks , separate from that insane woman hospitalized years past , lay smashed and in ruins . &quot;
i &apos;d like to put this kind of friday night bar discussion aside and get you to actually step into the lab .
and not just in chicago , but in the entire united states .
but cambodia is not alone .
every single one of us , depending on where we &apos;re sitting , will experience this sound quite , quite differently .
so i just want to tell you my story .
a possible mode of being here would be a way of life -- a way of being , experiencing , thinking , seeing , interacting with the world .
thomas friedman is one of my favorite new york times columnists , and he poignantly commented that 2008 is when we hit a wall , when mother nature and the market both said , &quot; no more . &quot;
because the clock is ticking for all of us .
so , there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs .
so that &apos;s the photographs that i wanted to show you .
and look again at this kleiber .
but in china they &apos;re saying , &quot; no , we &apos;re putting in 27 in the next 10 years . &quot;
now , they trade up the politicians every time .
they &apos;re right at the center of the whole thing .
it hardly happens .
so , taxi journeys might be one example .
because now , with this idea we can take a random sample of people , have them nominate their friends , those friends would be more central , and we could do this without having to map the network .
so i thought that it will be good to start with it .
it &apos;s like the lights are on , but nobody &apos;s home on this demographic y2k + 10 problem . right ?
put your arms straight down at your side , look up , open your eyes , stare straight ahead , and speak out your question loudly so everybody can hear .
i think it &apos;s there , and i think we need to go look for it , and i think it &apos;s underground .
but it &apos;s a lion of the sea . it &apos;s a top predator .
and we &apos;ve decided in the next three years , we will double the volume of certified material we put through our business .
these are , indeed , the chronic disorders of young people .
it takes a full eight minutes for its radiation to reach us .
the dark side of the web is allergic to the light .
and many think that these countries are stagnant , but they are not .
we need to confront this fear .
to make law simple so that you feel free , the people in charge have to be free to use their judgment to interpret and apply the law in accord with reasonable social norms .
you &apos;re putting yourself , you &apos;re binding yourself , and you &apos;re weaseling your way out of it , and then you &apos;re beating yourself up afterwards .
and yet , mysteriously , somehow the bee flies .
the search is not for the solution of the problem , but for problems themselves worth solving .
we talk about biofuels that haven &apos;t been invented yet .
now there &apos;s a reason why i study this , versus traditional anthropology .
finally , there &apos;s one of evening primrose that bjorn rorslett from norway sent me -- fantastic hidden pattern .
but it has been amazingly successful in one regard , in that it has become , it has congealed into this endangered people &apos;s movement that was missing in the 20th century .
now , a historian tells me it &apos;s even more difficult to predict about the past .
and when noah had done built his ark ...
now , you might think of flu as just a really bad cold , but it can be a death sentence .
but like i said , haibao looked very familiar , because he is actually the chinese character for &quot; people . &quot;
this single story of africa ultimately comes , i think , from western literature .
a blind man can see that the diamonds end up in his pocket .
we have to teach the kids that the world is not indestructible .
i want to show you a couple of examples why .
there are 1.4 billion different ways that a family can find itself .
so thank you very much .
breast cancer , as we said , kills women , but heart disease kills a whole bunch more .
and i really wanted this story to be about three things : i wanted it to be about abundance , about diversity and about resilience .
this is a creation story , i think , equally as wonderful .
what he was trying to do with me was to inspire me to protect the world , and show me just how fragile the world is .
my mother said , &quot; someone has to . &quot;
and it turns out that when you &apos;re anxious you squirt neural transmitters in the brain , which focuses you makes you depth-first .
here is the chart of over 43 people helping to steer the robot that could not steer and get it on its way , from one corner from one corner of washington square park to another .
derek sivers : keep your goals to yourself
so , this is my latest cooker , and if this looks more complicated than the nuclear reactor , that &apos;s because it is .
and i feel strongly enough about that to make a bet with you : either we &apos;re going to find e.t. in the next two dozen years , or i &apos;ll buy you a cup of coffee .
assuming you live a long life , there &apos;s a 50 percent chance you &apos;ll develop arthritis .
no , no , no , shush . we &apos;ve got to go quickly .
it is made for a diet which is soft , mushy , which is reduced in fibers , which is very easily chewable and digestible .
the millennium bridge was supposed to be the pride of london -- a beautiful new footbridge erected across the thames , first river crossing in over 100 years in london .
governor comes to him one day , actually invites him to come to his office .
now , our big symbol at ideo is actually not so much the place , it &apos;s a thing .
so what are we looking for in a meal ?
we &apos;re all liars .
so before i do that , just one warning , which is that this presentation has been rated &apos; r &apos; by the motion picture association of america .
which brings on another threshold effect i like to call furnace dumping , which is , quite simply , if you have a building that doesn &apos;t need to be heated with a furnace , you save a whole bunch of money up front .
maybe you will cut ? lift .
so this story stayed with me .
and i was so thrilled .
so i thought , well , why can &apos;t we do something like that and create a clean energy jobs race to the top ?
but it &apos;s never going to happen by forcing these organizations to lower their horizons to the demoralizing objective of keeping their overhead low .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re searching for -- when we &apos;re working our craft , we are really trying to find that truth out there .
the first was moral , that psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists , pathologizers , that our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble , bricks fell on you .
when we focus on ourselves in any activity , we do turn that part of ourselves off if there &apos;s another person .
and i was looking at that , trying to figure out what it means .
as eleni has said , when people gain income , they gain choice , and that is fundamental to dignity .
they say , well , we have a thing in a box , and we have its inputs and its outputs .
i called her up .
diabetes i &apos;ve just mentioned . heart failure we already talked about . hypertension : 74 million people could have continuous blood-pressure monitoring to come up with much better management and prevention .
and the rabbi said , &quot; you &apos;ve misunderstood me .
ok , now , do you believe in witchcraft at all ?
it makes the brain inherently robust .

derartu tulu ruins the script .
and we &apos;re not going to cure the problems of the urban by dragging the country into the city , which is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time .
what does this mean ?

today , we will see 250,000 individual new computer viruses .
one day , 16 years after i had this poster on my wall , i lay in bed and looked at her , and i suddenly thought , i wonder what the painter did to her to make her look like that .
and there &apos;s some spectacular things .
what we need to be able to do is to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of .
in the meanwhile , let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier .
why that ? because fuel is not easy to replace .
oh , when i was buying the clubs , somehow the young juggler was hiding from the others .
so they &apos;re less likely to be randomly false positives , randomly false negatives .
and they , if you try to produce a different wall with this 18th one , it will have to have the same symmetries as one of these 17 .

cruising random city streets , rocking a drop-top cadillac with a big backseat , packing like 13 brown paper walmart bags full of loaded mockingbirds , and i &apos;ll get everybody .
the water was cleaned , but because they got a lot of batteries , they were able to store a lot of electricity .

the red is modern conflict , conflicts within states .
i hate this stuff . it &apos;s hard to read .

and she published 42 articles just dedicated to the subject .
in ballooning , or in life , how do we change altitude ?
so they &apos;re skin cells that can be tricked , kind of like cellular amnesia , into an embryonic state .
one does a lot of hard work knowing that most of these ideas probably won &apos;t end up being true about nature .
let &apos;s say i &apos;m going to cut the liver right here .
and again , that brings us back to the importance of that spring in storing up and releasing so much energy in this system .
today we have 20 million refugees in the world .
it involves gravitational waves .
so low-income people often are the ones who are buying the products that have those dangerous chemicals in them that their children are using .
and at each one of these stages , can be seen as a collision -- a collision with something else -- for example , a critical price-line that changes both the technology and also changes its effect on the world . it &apos;s an inflection point .
why do they call it that ?
now , steve , you know where the spike is , but nobody else , does ? correct ?
isn &apos;t it a little convenient that in the midst of the world war , out of nowhere , suddenly an italian scientist showed up with an amazing new technology that would transform everything in the world and darken the history of the human species forever after ?

how many people here would say you &apos;re a maker , if you raise your hand ?
the way the tv-industrial complex works , is you buy some ads -- interrupt some people -- that gets you distribution .

so you can use this information to understand you in a responsive loop .
and you can actually see here the printhead going through and printing this structure , and it takes about 40 minutes to print this structure .

it &apos;s almost in the same way that a telescope or microscope recalibrates your eyesight ; i think computer simulations can recalibrate your instinct across vast scales of both space and time .
it comes from information that is freely available and out there , but that we are willfully blind to , because we can &apos;t handle , don &apos;t want to handle , the conflict that it provokes .
it is an increasingly difficult picture , even assuming the economy does quite well -- probably better than it will do .

these are the galleries with the light coming in through the skylights , and at night , and on opening day .
it was really humbling to see for the first time , to really understand that even if i could have taken a magic wand and fixed everything , i probably would have gotten a lot wrong .
the other thing is , we love batteries .
kevin , can you help ?
in the very short run , you can sometimes fool yourself into thinking that there &apos;s fundamentally opposing goals , but in the long run , ultimately , we &apos;re learning in field after field that this is simply not true .
and the visuals you &apos;re about to see are not prerecorded .
think about what happened .
you pick it up , you put the damn thing back on , and finish the goddamn race ! &quot;
thank you . thank you .
because isn &apos;t that easy ?
nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land .
it &apos;s as big as any of the biggest trees east of the mississippi river , and yet it &apos;s only a minor feature on chronos .
the moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine , you can start shooting at people .
so we have two prototypes .
and i started walking off .
we &apos;re born makers .
i was so determined to be a teacher now so that i could make a difference in my family .
i would also like to tell the world that animals love .
i wish i could do that now .
psychologists have known about the negative consequences of incentivizing everything for 30 years .
our subjects doubled their cheating .
but let me also thank the incredible creators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television screens throughout all these ages of television .
so i quickly went to work with a great team around me .
and i could never really understand exactly what it was , or how it was informing me .
i mean , there would be an advantage to experiencing our emotions inside , you know , anger or happiness .
so they &apos;re all using this molecule for interspecies communication .
not a single one of those cells is conscious ; not a single one of those cells knows who you are , or cares .
so think about a cop .
this is the kind of innovation that is , quite frankly -- it &apos;s interesting that it &apos;s coming from africa .
this is not really what the medical doctors are using right now , but i hope they will in the future .
but , in fact , most boys tend to be a certain way , and most girls tend to be a certain way .
it is the critical long-term shift caused by the internet .
as long as kids are playing computer games , graphics is getting better and better and better .
i was sort of astonished to find out how many i have actually .
but he hears some voices up in the stairwell , so he climbs up the stairwell .
so if you &apos;re driving on the freeway and you want to know where &apos;s the next gas station , you have a map to tell you that that gas station is down the road .
but i borrow a lesson that i learned from him .
because the more we learned , the more concerned we grew .
one , that we can put our attention wherever we want it to be ; two , that we will always be heard ; and three , that we will never have to be alone .
when you do this kind of stuff it &apos;s like doing eva .
it &apos;s written around 1834 , so , even though it &apos;s old , i hope you like it .
but the problem is , you get hungry , so it &apos;s hard to keep it off .
this is -- this is intense material , i should warn you .
the taliban are running suicide schools , preparing a generation of boys for atrocities against civilians .
do you give the nets for free to maximize coverage , or do you make people pay in order to make sure that they really value them ?
the reason it &apos;s different is that , just in the past few years , our machines have started demonstrating skills they have never , ever had before : understanding , speaking , hearing , seeing , answering , writing , and they &apos;re still acquiring new skills .
so , that was noraida , and just like lorraine and everybody else you &apos;re meeting today , these are folks who are based on real people from my real life : friends , neighbors , family members .
could it be there is something more going on here ?
we &apos;re then able to compare the results from that study with real world experience , because we &apos;re putting two of these in hospitals that johns hopkins works with in sierra leone , including the hospital where that emergency c-section happened .
the words on the card describe what will happen inside .
two months ago , i remembered that promise i made , when a distinguished english critic published an article in the london times , asking who could be the winner of the orchestra world cup .
we &apos;re lying in bed , and gene and i are talking about how cool we are .
this is what the u.k. government target on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like .
sometimes quite freshly floral , and then again sometimes extremely pungent . &quot;
and almost universally , amongst all the kids , they were really psychologically damaged by having been made fun of , ridiculed , picked on and been rejected .
can really take a leadership role , and chicago is one example .
it &apos;s emotional . it &apos;s personal .
it can only be a state of being , not just a fleeting emotion , sensation .
so it &apos;s going to be really important that he be able to drive me around some day .
but i &apos;m going to try and do something different , and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories , and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we &apos;ve been talking about .
i want to demo this actually , because it &apos;s a very simple process .
just imagine that the air surrounding these places -- it &apos;s filled with the residue of explosives and coal .
this building has the ability , in short order , to go back to a flat floor organization such that they can rent it out .
and i said , &quot; if you &apos;re serious , i will try to find a family for her . &quot;
or roger 2.0 .
and i think a lot of people in africa have this different perspective , and i think that &apos;s going to impact technology .
i set that whole thing up .
so thank you and thank you for listening .
well , you know what bovine stercus is ?
and david wanted to carve deeply into brad &apos;s face to bring the aging to this character .
and so it &apos;s not an accident that a great flowering of innovation happened as england switched to tea and coffee .
we know for example that we now have specialized eye trackers and infrared brain scans , mri &apos;s that can decode the signals that our bodies send out when we &apos;re trying to be deceptive .
so i said , &quot; i am dead , so i need to be born again . &quot;
since there was nothing there , you might as well not look .
and it &apos;s what i call being design driven .
and being alone is very unnatural to the human .
and if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by george orwell , well it turns out that george orwell was an optimist .
and 10 years ago it seemed like i had a lot of time to convince intel to work on this . right ?
they were singing and dancing .
first , they demoralize the people who are engaged in the activity .
but we &apos;re not content to stop there .
we belong to the family called the hominidae .
and we measured how much they were willing to pay for it .
and i guess i &apos;ll keep investigating until i get the answers .
what is it that makes us capable of supposing anything , and does this tell us anything about what we can suppose ?
and they thought that they clarified the issue , because they &apos;d set out a clear distinction between legal and illegal copying .
and mr. carrillo &apos;s alibi ?
let &apos;s begin with a story .
this e8 pattern has very deep mathematical roots .
it &apos;s a remarkably beautiful landscape . i can &apos;t even begin to describe it to you .
a local official literally prostrated himself in the street , in front of these protesters , in order to get them to go away .
and i see , even more importantly , the power of music to connect hearts .
yeah ! yeah .
because we kind of have to -- we &apos;re just compelled to .
now , mismatches -- when one person assumes one relationship type , and another assumes a different one -- can be awkward .
if you think about the problem of bananas versus chocolates , we think we &apos;re going to eat bananas next week .
in the upper right of that picture on the left is almost the mississippi delta , and the lower left of that picture is the texas-mexico border .
how much livestock do you need to produce this ?
the perfect kitchen -- no bills on the counter in the perfect kitchen .
it &apos;s the bridge over the drina river , the subject of a novel by ivo andrić , and it talks about how , in that very troubled part of europe and the balkans , over time there &apos;s been enormous building of walls .
i want to point out one thing . this is -- you guys know what this is .
this is buster setting up a pull-up machine at the office of his new startup habit labs , where they &apos;re trying to build up other applications like health month for people .
it &apos;ll spread to the entire curve .
here , you can see where punta tombo is , and they breed in incredibly dense colonies .
so when we came back to italy , and one of the things that i remember the most is my family having this hard time to share stories .
if you &apos;re really quick , if you &apos;re really quick -- and i can prove this -- this is half a towel from the dispenser in this building .
what is the ideal balance of human and machine ?
there &apos;s been a strong trend toward miniaturization , better sensitivity , so much so that , a few years ago , a gps tracking device looked like this clunky box to the left of the keys .
with trade , there &apos;s mutual interdependency and mutual gain between parties .
under no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis of whether someone had no arms , no legs -- they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand .
&quot; bless you , man . &quot;
biological yield is really important .
what is iran going to do about its nuclear weapons program ?
no time , unfortunately , to mention those . &quot;
and we invite you to participate . thank you very much .
just me and god-given talent .
how many of you here could describe the sound of a single planet or star ?
&quot; you didn &apos;t shave . &quot; &quot; but sir — &quot; &quot; no , don &apos;t tell me how often you scraped your face this morning .
nathalie miebach : art made of storms
so what else do you require ?
then he lost his job .
and so i started a collaboration with this person , michael zasloff and thomas fishbein , to look at the microbes that colonized these ilea after they were transplanted into a recipient .
the government , meanwhile , has been acting like santa claus .
and especially if it &apos;s kind of interesting books that you care about , in languages that you can read .
so imagine your kid &apos;s algebra textbook in seventh grade .
1887 : the dawes act .
there are beetles that roll little balls of dung great distances across the desert floor to feed to their hatchlings .
the eastern hemlock tree has often been described as the redwood of the east .
so there &apos;s really only one area where we &apos;re near the top , and that &apos;s in failing to give our teachers the help they need to develop their skills .
you know , just like people on the street when you get too close to them .
they survive because medieval scribes copied them and copied them and copied them .
i don &apos;t have a pointer here , but you see the green , sort of rectangle or trapezoid ?
the creator doesn &apos;t have any rights .
the second issue : your country could be under cyberattack with entire regions plunged into total darkness , and you may not even know who &apos;s attacking you .
i think right now the computers will be at the top and everything will be kind of going down and stuff .
he looks , it &apos;s a dog , he drops to his knees .
so the chance that she &apos;s innocent isn &apos;t one in 73 million .
comparing it with a typical building , what happens if we seek to use such design strategies in terms of really large-scale thinking ?
but the interactivity allows the audience to shape what you &apos;re going to do as much as you shape their experience of the world .
i want a house , and i want a car .
and i also bought a laser cutter and started to fabricate within my own shop , kind of , large-scale building elements and models , where we could go directly to the tooling .
if you can convince me we can do all that , then , yes , i would take the two percent .
in the process , i &apos;ve gathered a few fragments that help me shed some light on this puzzle .
and when the woman has male-pattern disease -- so she looks like barbara in the movie -- they get treated .
it &apos;s dna which is pretty badly fragmented , but with good techniques now , you can basically reassemble the whole genome .
this is my grandmother , and this is where i get this mouth .
these transactions create allies , not enemies .
one , ok , 197042 .
lesley hazleton : on reading the koran
but maybe we can afford to provide each student with a computer or a smartphone .
and so , i &apos;ve got about 20 seconds left , so if i &apos;m going to leave you with anything , last decade was the decade of social .
why ? because as your attention shifts to your cell phone , you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly to the car braking in front of you , and so you &apos;re much more likely to get engaged into a car accident .
by his own writing , this man was either asleep , at a prayer meeting with al and tipper or learning how to launch a nuclear missile out of a suitcase .
it is not the same pattern at two different scales .
and the point of this magazine was to read the articles , listen to the music , and try to interpret it .
some people have a better musical ability and ability to appreciate music than others have .
it was like vegetable jerky , and killed all of them .
but the trick with bridges is , ultimately , you need someone to cross them .
the best thing to do is to get as big as i can get . &quot;
the service which grew out of this , dial 1298 for ambulance , with one ambulance in 2004 , now has a hundred-plus ambulances in three states , and has transported over 100,000 patients and victims since inception .
and i know that &apos;s hard to believe , that the american people are moderate , pragmatic centrists .
this is a scene at base camp , at one of the camps where some of the climbers were lost .
now , how many things are these ?
these devices beat back and forth about 200 hertz during flight , and the animal can use them to sense its body rotation and initiate very , very fast corrective maneuvers .
they know perfectly well , but they have no other choice .
sometimes you just want to stand in the corner and stare out of the window .
i now look at my kitchen , and i bow to it , and i thank my ancestors for coming up with the invention that probably made us humans .
and so clearly they were criminals because of the way they died .
i had an office in those days which bordered a slum , an urban slum , so there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum .
my father has this on his desk , and he sees his grandchildren everyday , changing constantly .
now we &apos;re into a distance sort of between here and here .
and when we gave graduate engineers that question , they said it couldn &apos;t be done .
when i spoke to some printers when i started doing this and told them what i wanted to do , which was to print conductive inks onto paper , they told me it couldn &apos;t be done , again , that kind of favorite thing .
so this was before the computer was invented .
that chin barbel is flashing .
vc : thank you , neil .
we did this experiment with a group of patients who had anterograde amnesia . these are hospitalized patients .
this is where people normally object that it doesn &apos;t sound very sustainable to sail water from copenhagen to china .
i mean , they can do like seven kilometers an hour and sustain it .
eight , nine , 10 .
so , several years ago , i decided to look into the brain and study this madness .
it &apos;s just to tell you that in that red section of the brain stem , there are , to make it simple , all those little squares that correspond to modules that actually make brain maps of different aspects of our interior , different aspects of our body .
it was tracked for 43 days , swimming 1,700 kilometers , or more than 1,000 miles .
why were you all sure that the answer to the question was no , before i &apos;d even told you anything about the context ?
and so , if you think of cancer as a system , there &apos;s an input and an output and a state in the middle .
because liberals like to say , &quot; fetch , please . &quot;
another update : you will recall i introduced you guys to the quadro tracker .
this is a very different demographic .
are we alone in this vast universe of energy and matter and chemistry and physics ?
i am told you will go from here .
that &apos;s all , shukran . thank you very much for the opportunity .
tim jackson : an economic reality check
but if you haven &apos;t played with a battery and a bulb , if you &apos;ve only seen a circuit diagram , you might not be able to do that , and that &apos;s one of the problems .
i had to meet my prime minister .
i think if you treat people well , people will come back and come back for more .
i did not expect to be spending a significant part of my time as a harvard surgeon worrying about checklists .
why have we got 130,000 troops on the ground ?
well , the question with which i &apos;d like to end is this : if we &apos;re so damn stupid , how did we get to the moon ?
see if you can see those waves propagating through the swarm .
but they also have rising costs to our security , economy , health and environment that are starting to erode , if not outweigh their benefits .
at the same time , all of our firepower was impotent when it came to halting or even stemming the slaughter in rwanda , darfur , myanmar .
gene and gail know everyone in atlanta -- they &apos;re the most social couple imaginable .
and i had a mac classic . and it &apos;s a little box .
and when that responsibility is diffused between a whole network of researchers , academics , industry sponsors , journal editors , for some reason we find it more acceptable , but the effect on patients is damning .
so why all the big deal about genetics ?
so you have this little algal forest , and in the size of a laptop you can find more than 100 species of algae , mostly microscopic fit hundreds of species of little animals that then feed the fish , so that the system recovers .
but this part of the equation i didn &apos;t really get , and i don &apos;t think my physicians really get this part of the equation .
well , the answer to that question , and who was really involved and what really happened , well that &apos;s going to probably remain locked away in the secretive company registries of the british virgin islands and elsewhere unless we all do something about it .
all it takes in one person to mess it up .
the infant mortality rate is the highest on this continent and is about three times higher than the u.s. national average .
we &apos;ll have completed the reverse-engineering of the human brain , 1,000 dollars of computing will be far more powerful than the human brain in terms of basic raw capacity .
it &apos;s an old eastern tradition based on the knowledge that it &apos;s not healthy for a human being to spend too much time staring at his own reflection .
so , why -- why and where -- did chop suey come from ?
self-sustaining entities , 18 months return on investment , plus we &apos;re paying people living wage and health benefits , while feeding people for pennies on the dollar .
i &apos;m like , &quot; that &apos;s stupid because you have to work for five hours .
because they were getting it from abroad .
i make a rural woman to compete with multinationals .
well , we said , what if you now send the command to the phantom , but give him visual feedback that it &apos;s obeying his command , right ?
i &apos;m not so old .
i think a great example of this is ethiopia &apos;s new health extension program .
and yet , two hours later you find yourself standing on the roof of this monastery , smeared with mud , blood and sweat .
we brought in rick baker , and rick is one of the great makeup and special effects gurus of our industry .
this is less than a dollar and this is non-stick ; it is coated with one of these food-grade materials .
and the network effects rule , meaning that the more you have , the more you get .
simple .
there &apos;s much more in culture : there &apos;s manuscripts , there newspapers , there &apos;s things that are not text , like art and paintings .
it was said when he got a copy of the king james bible or &quot; aesop &apos;s fables , &quot; he was so excited he couldn &apos;t sleep .
we need incentives . people have to make a living .
and she said maybe part of the reason was it was difficult for her .
this whimsical wrap-up of ted2006 -- presented by einstein , the african grey parrot , and her trainer , stephanie white -- simply tickles . watch for the moment when einstein has a moment with al gore .
around the world today we &apos;re seeing an incredible transformation , from what i would call a biocidal species , one that -- whether we intentionally or unintentionally -- have designed our systems to kill life , a lot of the time .
george bush thought he was going to invade iraq , find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction , liberate the people and bring democracy to the middle east .
there will be massive amounts of data flowing ashore , all available to anyone who has any interest in using it .
i have three more years than i thought .
they don &apos;t spend time alone .
you &apos;ll hear a train in moment that they don &apos;t react to .
one day that eye may be that of an intelligent alien , and the sooner we eschew our narrow view of evolution the sooner we can truly explore our ultimate origins and destinations .
in fact , it was capable of doing everything we do today with computers , only really slowly .
they lie beyond the visible .
the association is very easy : buy green , don &apos;t buy red , think twice about yellow .
he co-wrote a mockumentary about failed superheroes called &quot; super-has-beens . &quot;
so this dung pat was actually -- well , it was a dung pat 15 minutes before this photograph was taken , and we think it &apos;s the intense competition that makes the beetles so well-adapted to rolling balls of dung .
it &apos;s called the other car .
now , i had been working on other topics : the emergence of infectious diseases , which come out of the natural ecosystems of the earth , make a trans-species jump , and get into humans .
and you &apos;ll see , there &apos;s some damage to the surface of the coral .
this shift is the most striking in the u.s. and in the u.k. , but it &apos;s a global phenomenon .
thank you . thank you .
leading the way -- what &apos;s leading the way ?
these robots we &apos;re shipping every day .
but what breaks my heart and what &apos;s alarming is that in those two interviews , the people around , who were interviewed as well , refer to that behavior as talibanization .
but there &apos;s still a sort of filling in , as we can tell if we look at this .
you heard stories earlier today about patients who are taking control of their cases , patients who are saying , &quot; you know what , i know what the odds are , but i &apos;m going to go look for more information .
thank you .
in the health care system , if you touch average , you &apos;re done .
which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue , the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food .
it also recognizes where you &apos;re looking , your head orientation .
help me build this school .
most of them come from very optionless families , not just poor .
now if you look at hong kong , they have a very interesting system called octopus there .
now why do we call david an underdog ?
and i would like to know what the audience is , and so who of you ever ate insects ?
but i want you to take this very seriously .
and the other thing that &apos;s pretty cool about the technology is that it only transfers energy to things that work at exactly the same frequency .
so the most common question i get asked , and i &apos;m going to answer it now so i don &apos;t have to do it over drinks tonight , is how did this come about ?
i think we have three challenges for the future .
and she found the place and decided to go there , went there .
in the experiments i told you about , we have lifted the identity of the critic , but we still have no idea how the critic does its job .
this will linger during the break , so take advantage of the networking opportunities .
and if somebody answers , that shall be my wish . &quot;
this light up here is the same light that occurs in every middle-class foyer in america .
what do they have in common ?
and then they said to half the physicians , they said , &quot; yesterday you reviewed the patient &apos;s case and you realized that you forgot to try one medication .
but the king was serious .
and here &apos;s the only picture of leonardo that &apos;s widely accepted .
so the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities .
but you may not know that he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain , noninvasively , with focused ultrasound in the &apos; 50s .
it &apos;s activated when one recognizes cartoons , when one draws cartoons , and when one hallucinates them .
if you go into that phone , every single thing in that phone or computer or any other computing device is mathematics . it &apos;s all numbers at the bottom .
if we ate like a primate , we should not be here .
i said , &quot; great . what do you do ? &quot;
believe it or not , even with internal viscera .
some 74 percent of people received the data .
in order to do six cups , i must have perfect control over three with my right hand .
some of you remember this , i &apos;m sure .
yet i could see soiled nappies , and i could see that some of the children were distressed , but the only noise was a low , continuous moan .
what &apos;s really important is that the ecx will operate a market information system to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country , using vsat technology to bring an electronic price dissemination directly to farmers .
there are other questions like this , too .
a 400-foot-tall calving face breaking off .
and for those of you in the diaspora who are struggling with where should i be , should i move back , should i stay ?
and these plants need sunlight , so we know when we find that sediment there &apos;s no ice overhead .
it &apos;s almost like the concept of number being developed for symmetry .
a major overhaul of poland &apos;s education helped to dramatically reduce between variability among schools , turn around many of the lowest-performing schools , and raise performance by over half a school year .
in 2008 , it flew for a whopping 20 seconds , a year later , two minutes , then six , eventually 11 .
my parents were radicals -- who became , well , grown-ups .
transferred to a larger scale -- actually a lot larger , with a lot of help -- 14,064 bicycle reflectors -- a 20-day install .
and so along with changing who worked there , you must have come up against another positioning that we always run into , in particular with women , and it has to do with outside image , dress , the veiled woman .
but as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day-to-day lives , incredible things happened .
children have been trafficked from other conflict zones to come and work on the coffee plantations .
which one seems longer ?
we pursue our individual goals .
and my son , youngest son who studied in beijing , in china , he got a long-term perspective .
interviewer : just sideways . about how much was it moving , do you think ?
kirsten ashburn : mmm , gosh .
but soon they realized that this is the new role of designer : to be in this process from the very beginning to the very end .
so this is another one of these mind-boggling global problems .
and the problem when you &apos;re younger -- for all you students out there -- is , your head gets kind of big really easy .
it &apos;s an antidote to the growing tendency we have to feel that we can really ever experience life by watching it on a computer screen , you know , when we &apos;re in a wi-fi zone .
but seriously , seriously , we did get along , because we had a common goal of wanting to inspire these young people .
i want you to examine the shard of glass .
a few years ago , kevin kelly , my partner , and i noticed that people were subjecting themselves to regimes of quantitative measurement and self-tracking that went far beyond the ordinary , familiar habits such as stepping on a scale every day .
so building this complete teacher feedback and improvement system won &apos;t be easy .
and this is codex c here .
remarkably , we find we can completely dissociate these two abnormalities .
ninety-five percent of that land can only feed people from animals .
i grew up with a radio in a car .
remarkable impact on mortality .
this is all i &apos;m asking for really in human decision making , is the consideration of these three things .
and it is important to prove that growth and democracy are not incompatible , that you can have a democracy , that you can have an open society , and you can have growth .
he was talking to a very large man , but i didn &apos;t care .
they &apos;re basically retaining their juvenile characteristics very late in what we call ontogeny .
executive office of the president .
because the web of the spider , it was sending me insane , because i couldn &apos;t get the web to move off .
trita parsi : iran and israel : peace is possible
and my uncle suddenly says , &quot; where are chris &apos; presents ? &quot;
he was a design scientist , if you like , a poet , but he foresaw all the things that are happening now .
as many as 100 million refugees from bangladesh could be expected to migrate into india and into china .
my seeing her , it wasn &apos;t her , at the mailbox .
so the biggest and the most important thing is our neutral point-of-view policy .
the personal debt-to-income ratio basically went from 65 percent to 135 percent in the span of about 15 years .
because this woman comes up -- you see at the end of the video -- she comes up .
but then , he said , &quot; if you see a leopard , boy , you better run like hell . &quot;
and these are in the form of sensory apparatus -- telescopes , microscopes -- reasoning apparatus -- various ways of thinking -- and , most importantly , in the ability to change perspective on things .
and i want to show you one of our tests .
would somebody get us started by giving us a two-digit number please ?
and people would come in and learn more about it .
i &apos;m going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow , one kind of flow of people , one kind of flow of capital , and , of course , trade in products and services .
the connection is the energy it takes to run the web , and to make everything we think possible , possible .
anyway he thought he &apos;d better do it , because i never met him before and he might lose face if he hadn &apos;t done the thing i sent him .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll be content together . &quot;

the nine-year-old put an impulse on every four notes .
so they get it in about 20 minutes and those who require surgery , are counseled , and then there are buses waiting , which will transport them to the base hospital .
but i don &apos;t think we should underestimate the extent to which massive changes in technology make possible the linking up of people across the world .

we &apos;ve been able to see every single nerve .
in a series of shows that includes &quot; 100 percent vancouver , &quot; &quot; 100 percent berlin , &quot; rimini protokoll makes shows that actually reflect society .
there &apos;s a hole at the front , and there &apos;s a reason for that .
but the problem is that it &apos;s a really ugly patty .
jacqueline novogratz : invest in africa &apos;s own solutions
so , they &apos;re learning from each other . and research bears this out .
i &apos;ve got a little video to show you , but keep in mind that this is with no electronic control , and this is also with only four leds .
and we are able to use this money for many things : very importantly , we put it in education .
stop global warming ; use condoms .
and that &apos;s the stealing cards , which i did .
they develop -- you can see on the far right one where it seems to just stack on top of each other , room , after room , after room .
but can an organism like this teach us anything about emotion-like states ?
now , this one &apos;s pretty cool .
what they have in common is what we see unlocks what we cannot see .
the air temperature was not too high , but it was not comfortable during these games .
the other point i &apos;d like to make about this is that this ocean &apos;s interconnected .
what the probe came down in was basically the titan equivalent of a mud flat .
anything that makes me think . anything that i don &apos;t understand , where i have to make the leap myself , in my own head , is going to stop the flow of the presentation .
but what if god doesn &apos;t act ? what if god doesn &apos;t do things at all ?
they carry over 60 million simultaneous voice conversations , and in a lot of the government and technology sites there was just this very apparent vulnerability .
it &apos;s almost like you can see them learning over those last 10 problems .
now as you &apos;re reading , however , you will be maybe surprised that you will quickly become numb to the numbers of deaths , because you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers of faceless , nameless dead people .
i mean that we have mathematically consistent theories that were actually introduced to explain a completely different phenomenon , ok , things that i haven &apos;t even talked about , that each predict the existence of a very weakly interacting , new particle .
so this actually has given rise to a really big internet meme that tens of thousands of people have participated in , which is called captcha art .
so you &apos;re kind of trying to say , &quot; people of iran , this is your destiny , lets go there . &quot;
oh , there we are . we can save it now .
&quot; well , you can &apos;t clearcut with a ... &quot;
the destabilizing effects of hunger are known throughout human history .
you know , you can tell -- and i think when we &apos;re getting into collective play , its really important for groups to gain a sense of safety through their own sharing of play signals .
because we &apos;ve got to stop , we &apos;ve got to do something where we unite -- separate from all the politics and religion that , as a young person , is confusing me .
those hearing parents tend to try to cure them .
if that does not survive , i &apos;m not the thing giving this talk .
and most of these levers have popularity problems , and if there is a lever you don &apos;t like the use of , well please do bear in mind that means you need even stronger effort on the other levers .
it just affects the payback period if you &apos;re comparing to grid-supplied electricity .
one for extracting oxygen out of the deep-sea water , another one which houses this chemosynthetic bacteria , which takes the hydrothermal fluid -- that hot water that you saw coming out of the bottom -- and converts that into simple sugars that the tube worm can digest .
are we guilty , as chimamanda adichie reminded us at the ted conference in oxford , of assuming that there is a single story of women &apos;s struggles for their rights while there are , in fact , many ?
they &apos;re actually developing a lot of their science and engineering curriculum to spread widely around the world in our system and they &apos;re also trying to develop all of their software tools completely open-source .
so , i went to the museum of natural history , and i checked out the bones , and i went to the gift shop , and i bought a book .
and from that point on i started thinking , are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong in this particular decision , or is it a more general case ?
and then a bbc crew came cruising through the biology department , looking for a story to do about new technologies in biology .
and i think that &apos;s some of the fear that we see about jobs disappearing from artificial intelligence and robots .
and then finally , having done all that , you &apos;ve now told me the whole thing , so now you &apos;ve got to bring it back to that conclusion .
so i tend to avoid that .
unfortunately , there &apos;s one group of people who get almost no systematic feedback to help them do their jobs better , and these people have one of the most important jobs in the world .
i called my sister . i called my neighbors . i said , &quot; come dig . &quot;
ushahidi , by contrast , is civic value .
you know , we have to change it .
somehow buying a local lettuce , changing a light bulb , driving the speed limit , changing your tires regularly , doesn &apos;t seem sufficient in the face of climate crisis .
i go , &quot; i don &apos;t know where we &apos;re going . &quot;
we are coming out of 50 years , most unusual years , of history in which we have had a totally mono-polar world , in which every compass needle for or against has to be referenced by its position to washington -- a world bestrode by a single colossus .
a smoldering grief .
i think it &apos;s because there &apos;s an imbalance , an asymmetry , in the way we treat creative , emotionally-driven psychological ideas versus the way we treat rational , numerical , spreadsheet-driven ideas .
we do have artists , but unfortunately we have not discovered them yet .
or immediately afterward , the han dynasty , still 2,000 years ago .
these nano-bots i mentioned will first be used for medical and health applications : cleaning up the environment , providing powerful fuel cells and widely distributed decentralized solar panels and so on in the environment .
jm : you might also want to have a look at this particular n-gram , and that &apos;s to tell nietzsche that god is not dead , although you might agree that he might need a better publicist .
it was always part of how they looked at the world . and that &apos;s what &apos;s really powerful .
so people have created this business .
broccoli is not a chinese vegetable ; in fact , it is originally an italian vegetable .
lyn gardner in the guardian has written that a great festival can show us a map of the world , a map of the city and a map of ourselves , but there is no one fixed festival model .
certainly that &apos;s true for most of human prehistory .
shortly after the tsunami i read a newspaper article written by the archbishop of canterbury -- fine title -- about the tragedy in southern asia .
his name is jesse sullivan .
but today i believe finally infrastructure is something which is agreed upon and which people want to implement .
i want you to remember that to create life &apos;s very diverse and complex forms , life uses computation to do that .
and to carry on with a theme that we &apos;ve already touched with is how nature is related to architecture .
it &apos;s basically symptoms .
&quot; thus said cyrus , king of persia , &apos; all the kingdoms of the earth have the lord god of heaven given thee , and he has charged me to build him a house in jerusalem .
he could never leave the tank or interact with the outside world .
rm : yeah . i , every time you think you &apos;ve chased something down , it &apos;s funny , no matter how good you are , and i know guys like this , it feels like you &apos;re polishing a turd .
understanding is not excusing . psychology is not excuse-iology .
in a country ravaged by violence against women , indian peacekeepers have inspired many local women to join the police force .
do you all know that spain -- part of the eu -- got 10 billion dollars in aid from the rest of the eu ?
you can &apos;t learn to fly at mach 20 unless you fly .
the right answer , confirmed by the soviet venera spacecraft , was that venus was very hot -- 900 degrees fahrenheit .
i would put it in the following equation : no 9 / 11 , no war .
and so , all the time you say , oh , i can predict the things .
as you can see , he &apos;s looking at the moment . he &apos;s got a little grimace on his face .
so clearly there is some effect .
we have our friend the domestic chicken .
and what &apos;s really neat about it -- well , actually , this all looks like nano-artwork , but it turns out that nano-artwork is just what you need to make nano-circuits .
imagine that snobbery is a distinctively u.k. phenomenon fixated on country houses and titles .
we found this last year .
sylvia &apos;s interested in art training .
now , this is a spectroscope , ok , on my laboratory bench .
and you answer my objection .
and everyone goes , &quot; great ! &quot; he leaves the country and the french and the germans go , &quot; no , no , forget about that , absolutely not . &quot; nothing happens . he goes to strasburg .
that doesn &apos;t work .
we have to do better than this .
hello . actually , that &apos;s &quot; hello &quot; in bauer bodoni for the typographically hysterical amongst us .
i was able to morph the culture into a non-sporulating form .
in theater , you have the character and the actor in the same place , trying to negotiate each other in front of an audience .
i &apos;ve discovered these people , who , in v-day world , we call vagina warriors .
we are left with this missing space of increased deaths the further north you go .
i &apos;m a farm boy . i grew up surrounded by animals , and i would look in these eyes and wonder what was going on there ?
hopefully very soon we will be there , because we are destined , obsessed with making it real .
there &apos;s also a weather goddess who controls a random stock market and random weather .
it &apos;s deeply embedded in the brain .
today , viruses are a global problem .
a single strand dipped in water that completely self-folds on its own into the letters m i t.
now in the extraordinary time that we have worked with legadema -- which is really over a five-year period -- 10,000 leopards were legally shot by safari hunters .
its head is down . it &apos;s walking backwards .
now to be clear , we &apos;re not quite ready to do this .
there &apos;s millions connected .
and i have a copy .
thank you .
what didn &apos;t work well ? our math sheets , or greeting visitors at the door .
but in fact , it was just coming up -- it was the nighttime ; the daytime temperatures didn &apos;t go up .
then you see his left leg .
so gneezy and rustichini said , &quot; how many instances of late pick-ups are there at these 10 daycare centers ? &quot;
age as pathology .
perhaps we are ready for something literally and figuratively more cultured .
i can hardly find the words to describe the peace i felt when i was acting .
this is a very important thing to know about people .
then i first took this job in hamburg , at an art pottery where everything was done on the wheel , and so i worked in a shop where there were several potters .
and of course , when it comes to cognitive effects , &quot; use it or lose it &quot; applies , so you want to stay mentally stimulated .
i think we live in a society which has simply pegged certain emotional rewards to the acquisition of material goods .
( audience : i just wanted to ask you , when we wear seatbelts we don &apos;t necessarily wear them just to prevent loss of life , it &apos;s also to prevent lots of serious injury .
so we start off the story with ernest , who volunteers as a census taker .
so i &apos;m thinking , &quot; mr. huf isn &apos;t going to be very happy when i told him his house has gone to another , into the atmosphere somewhere . &quot;
it &apos;s about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference .
just wait over there .
so right before the revolution we said that egyptians had never felt worse about their lives , but not only that , they thought their future would be no better .
how hard is it going to be to find life on mars ?
and there &apos;s a lot of rewards in thinking about complexity and emergence , not so much in thinking about simplicity .
but for another client in another culture , it could really be the right answer to a different question .
it looks like women got some power boost on a video game , or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills that lets them shoot up high .
and so , whereas dr. oliver sacks has talked about how perhaps one person in a million actually has true synesthesia , where they hear colors or taste shapes , and things like this , phonaesthesia is something we can all experience to some extent .
from just an idea that sounded crazy , you have the largest encyclopedia in the world .
because , when people heard that my son was a victim , i got immediate sympathy .
how may know somebody like this ? come on .
this is daniel ; he &apos;s one of our students in arctic village , alaska .
there &apos;s no democracy worth the name that doesn &apos;t have a transparency move , but transparency is openness in only one direction , and being given a dashboard without a steering wheel has never been the core promise a democracy makes to its citizens .
cool roofs are highly reflective surfaces that don &apos;t absorb solar heat and pass it on to the building or atmosphere .
now , to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life , for human beings , we know that there is a continuum of such facts .
&quot; sputnik &quot; was downtown , the negative . it wasn &apos;t touched .
people just go because it &apos;s pleasurable to be there .
if i show another aspect of that technology then , in a completely different context -- this apartment building in the alps in switzerland .
it gives us a little bit of justin bieber and a little bit of afghanistan .
okay , so frieda is my dead skeleton .
tell them this story . convince them to tell the story to another two persons .
and probably a whole bunch of trees as well .
and what those four chemicals do is they take any cell and take it way back up the mountain so it can become any body part .
well , that &apos;s pretty amazing .
and so what do the monkeys do ?
everybody wanted their deposit back . everybody is fleeing .
so when you do this , and when you plot the data , you pretty quickly come to some weird conclusions .
the animals are simply gone .
and i &apos;d like to talk about some of those just for the next few minutes .
i had so many surgeries to put my neck back together , to repair my heart a few times .
very -- one of the top popular singers in england today , katie melua .
still has the tag in it from me buying it , so i can take it back to the shop if she didn &apos;t like it .
how would i know what i was doing differently ?
oliver sacks : what hallucination reveals about our minds
did you know that we americans have about three times the amount of space we did 50 years ago ?
and if had been a horror movie , people in the audience would have started saying , &quot; don &apos;t go in there . don &apos;t go in there . &quot;
we have to change it so that the country is strong and stays at the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education , like science and mathematics .
that &apos;s bad news for us too .
the smoking debate took 40 years , and that was an easy one .
and you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse -- even when it &apos;s pretty old , like age 60 for a human , that old for a mouse -- if you give the mouse rapamycin , it will live longer .
and i &apos;m just going to zip through these slides .
pretty powerful .
james stavridis : a navy admiral &apos;s thoughts on global security
but that &apos;s not really true : you can be a serious professional adult and , at times , be playful .
is matter evolvable ?
aubrey de grey : my name &apos;s aubrey de grey , from cambridge .
let me talk about my own experience .
now this is a totally reasonable assumption , given that i have made quite a habit of encouraging people to spend more time playing games .
because your choice now is either i use my own needle now , or i could share a needle now and get a disease that &apos;s going to possibly kill me 10 years from now , or i could use my own needle now and go to jail tomorrow .
so , what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve succeeded in making something much bigger than a dna origami by combining dna origami with tiles .
free is probably the most interesting thing .
we did it so fast we weren &apos;t prepared for their collapse .
so , he &apos;d taken this data and made a presentation which just shattered a lot of myths that people had about the economics in the developing world .
this is what our summum bonum is .
it turns out there &apos;s an enormous amount of information already available on that subject , which is the mars rover problem .
so in america , it was kind of ridiculous that they said i should go to high school .
on the left there is the packbot from irobot .
why don &apos;t we control for other factors ?
in 1986 , i moved to rwanda , and i worked with a very small group of rwandan women to start that country &apos;s first microfinance bank .
and i love you , and i &apos;ll always be with you .
if you think about it , if you want to live in a world in the future where there are fewer material goods , you basically have two choices .
we all know that the internet has shrunk space as well as time .
i think we all -- if we don &apos;t look in the data -- we underestimate the tremendous change in asia , which was in social change before we saw the economical change .
okay .
but eventually , no matter how good you are at digging up the church records , and all that stuff , you hit what the genealogists call a brick wall .
this was the economic level at which sweden was .
and then i got this image in my head of what would happen if you yanked the wire from the wall and if you started to follow it . where would it go ?
in fact , the story holds true even if you have a person who got sight after several years of deprivation .
it &apos;s the precise amount of harm that comes to media companies whenever a single copyrighted song or movie gets pirated .
i don &apos;t believe it and i think this idea , popular as it is -- not in this guise but in general -- is itself one of the main problems that we face .
what would our ancestors 10,000 years ago have said if they really had technology assessment ?
so thank you . thank you , thomas . you &apos;re a delight .
i &apos;ll talk you through one example , and that &apos;s the example that everyone here will be aware of , and that &apos;s the example of al-qaeda .
and this is the weight of all air and land vertebrates .
how powerful would our world be if we had kids who were not afraid to take risks , who were not afraid to think , and who had a champion ?
beau lotto : optical illusions show how we see
when i was a young child , my mother , who was a choreographer , came upon a phenomenon that worried her .
how could it ever be adaptive for any organism to overcome self-interest ?
you know , andy grove stepped down as chairman of the board at intel -- and andy was one of my mentors , tough individual .
another , different kind of poem of youth and age .
this is benki .
it has a magnetic quality that draws me in .
i have , like , a thing about sleeping .
and that makes us larger than the u.s. as a telephone market .
and so you can actually sort of almost double your boat speed with systems like that . so that &apos;s sort of another interesting aspect of the future .
this may , we &apos;re going to go from minus 1,000 meters in zacaton , and if we &apos;re very lucky , depthx will bring back the first robotically-discovered division of bacteria .
now , that played itself out in the world cup campaign .
hi there .
so it was a little discouraging to the students .
it &apos;s a way to create new rules , and let people opt-in without coercion , and the opposition that coercion can force .
but can you sustain your company that way ?
ultimately , when we get it right , reputation capital could create a massive positive disruption in who has power , trust and influence .
and thank you chemical processing industry that gave us time to read books . &quot;
i remember that scene like it was yesterday ; i was 16 , i was in tears , i was in the closet , and i &apos;m looking at these two people , ferris bueller and some guy i &apos;d never seen before , fighting for love .
but i &apos;m going see what happens if i press this button .
so i traveled to boston , to cambridge , and i went to this wonderful ig nobel prize ceremony held at harvard university , and this ceremony is a very nice experience .
so we are trying to wipe out this virus completely .
i talk to him for hours .
but it turns out that in 1918 that was not the case at all .
our hands are amazing instruments .
interviewer : right . so if we get on it , we should be able to wobble it , yes ?
and everybody outside thought we were dying .
and i &apos;ll never forget hearing that story from dr. rachel naomi remen , who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her , that in the beginning of the creation something happened and the original light of the universe was shattered into countless pieces .
we have to come and attack this problem with a focus , with an effort that actually says , we &apos;re going to go to zero before the world ends .
we have opportunities in agriculture , like i said .
this is a drug called tamiflu . tamiflu is a drug which governments around the world have spent billions and billions of dollars on stockpiling , and we &apos;ve stockpiled tamiflu in panic , in the belief that it will reduce the rate of complications of influenza .
and aggregated , these smaller interceptions could actually infiltrate all the roadborne pollution that now runs into the estuary system , up to a seven inch rain event , up to a hundred-year storm .
let me give you an even more radical example of it : something called the results only work environment , the rowe , created by two american consultants , in place in place at about a dozen companies around north america .
if you want to take the game around the world , it &apos;s got to be the shortest form of the game .
but these localized rituals become pan-andean , and these fantastic festivals , like that of the qoyllur rit &apos;i , which occurs when the pleiades reappear in the winter sky .
the children are virtual prisoners ; they cannot leave , they cannot go home .
and then we apply all these other principles like transparency , professional management , measurable results , scalability , &#91; unclear &#93; , etc .
bf : yeah , it &apos;s all right .
and he invited us in particular because we have a very specific type of design process -- one that results in appropriate design solutions in places that don &apos;t usually have access to design services or creative capital .
whales also have contact calls like i described for the dolphins .
you &apos;re looking at a great example here .
so , these are the words i am waiting to hear , but from my son , not my daughter .
you start off at 11,500 feet .
and believe me , these are current pictures .
in a country of a billion people and some , why so few ?
somebody is camping in your head .
oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day , plus another four billion dollars a day in hidden economic and military costs , raising its total cost to over a sixth of gdp .
so this is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging .
of course , it &apos;s going to empower whoever is most skilled at using the technology and best understands the internet in comparison with whoever their adversary is .
those of you who changed your mind in favor of &quot; for &quot; put your hands up .
the other problem is they &apos;re right in the ozone layer , and i &apos;d prefer them above the ozone layer .
but actually , before placing the scaffold into the patient , we actually exercise it .
now talking about e.t. putting us there , or some other life , just pushes the problem further on .
fourteen minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and generous people who fought with me and for me and who waited to welcome me back from that agonized , lonely place .
and i thought that was incredibly peculiar .
but first of all , i want you to do me a favor .
the environmental protection agency even classified this group as a top-priority pollutant because it &apos;s been shown to cause cancer and birth defects by acting as a hormone disruptor .
but they said , &quot; you guys , you think that soldiers who are dying are not important , and your animals you are protecting are most important .
the first has to do with memory , that we can find these moments .
you and everyone else . this is the safe way to drive .
in somalia , the central government collapsed and clan warfare broke out .
you can get more bang for your buck , let &apos;s say .
so that means that the normal function of this hormone receptor is to speed up aging .
now , it &apos;s not without its problems .
many years ago , when i was a young congressman , i spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge of nuclear arms control -- the nuclear arms race .
our industrial society is scarcely 300 years old .
but there &apos;s also a downside to this -- a kind of dark side , in fact -- and that is that the more tightly linked we &apos;ve become to each other , the harder it is for each of us to remain independent .
research and ethics committee : if you want to do anything new in surgery , you have to get a license from your local research and ethics .
how about counting every calorie ?
and it &apos;s only a few months since governments injected enormous sums of money to try and keep the whole system afloat .
i &apos;m going to show you something a bit weird now .
a famous one , it &apos;s called the &quot; sevenfold causal method of developing compassion . &quot;
it &apos;s a way to bring power to the developing world , because it &apos;s produced in a factory and it &apos;s cheap .
this was my mental model of the world : exploding population , small planet ; it &apos;s going to lead to ugly things .
so when i look around , i think the day is not too far off at all when we &apos;re going to have androids doing a lot of the work that we are doing right now .
here &apos;s what newton himself said : &quot; nature is very consonant and conformable to her self . &quot;
he wonders , &quot; if my geologists don &apos;t know where the gold is , maybe somebody else does . &quot;
and we &apos;re going to be talking about 600 , 700 people . &quot;
but more significantly , they gave me the ability to believe , totally , to believe that i could .
this is that great big secret . because the internet provides this level playing field .
imagine what happens when the cost of getting information from anywhere to anywhere is close to zero .
ep : okay , osorio , thank you very much .
you can see that the health started to improve .
and he took me through specific examples of when he really needed it .
so we started out trying to figure out . how do we get to 10 cents ?
the nuclear waste typically goes into a dry cask storage out back of the parking lot at the reactor site because most places don &apos;t have underground storage yet .
that &apos;s understandable , but our experience with met suggests that if teachers manage the process , if they collect video in their own classrooms , and they pick the lessons they want to submit , a lot of them will be eager to participate .
europa is so far away that even at the speed of light , it would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle .
you know , you create power , then you tame it .
just when they stop needing our help taking a bath , they need our help dealing with cyberstalking or bullying .
in the first phase of development we were really enthused by all the things we could control with our mind .
what i &apos;m searching for is a durable mutation -- that &apos;s what all of us are searching for .
the vast majority of economists -- it is so uncool to call yourself an ideologue of either camp .
and now there &apos;s smoke and flames coming by our windows -- we &apos;re on the eleventh floor .
now , let &apos;s see the surfaces according to the quality of light that they reflect .
i &apos;m always thinking , &quot; how could i be more successful ? &quot;
it &apos;s not about low cost .
and the box has two knobs .
is that visible ? what i &apos;d like to talk about is one-sided things .
now that is less than a year old , in an operating room .
this is the breakdown product of the bedrock , that organisms are busy munching their way through .
what a coincidence !
but that &apos;s the lectures .
so here &apos;s an example . i &apos;ll use a figure eight , tracing out a figure eight as an example .
and there &apos;s some evidence that they are .
so what does all this add up to ?
now we can compare this to cutting-edge human performance .
the schools need you . the teachers need you .
you know , orion facing the roaring bull .
in so doing , i reached a frontier of biology so strange , so rich , that it seemed as though it exists on another planet .
and do you ever say , &quot; no , no i &apos;m not going to . &quot;
&quot; no ... not at all . &quot;
his grandfather died when he was only 10 .
and it goes like this .
what if morals , what if what makes something moral is just a matter of if it maximizes pleasure and minimizes pain ?
i can release my wing when i am in a spin or unstable .
so that was the idea .
the americans have even recognized it , in an agreement .
and it also supports working-class kids going into indian schools .
but ultimately , what is a story ? it &apos;s a contradiction .
so if i can make an analogy , let &apos;s say that you were trying to tell the difference between a good restaurant , a healthy restaurant and a sick restaurant , and all you had was the list of ingredients that they had in their larder .
you &apos;ve never seen data presented like this . with the drama and urgency of a sportscaster , statistics guru hans rosling debunks myths about the so-called &quot; developing world . &quot;
we get the generators from the companies .
they spent the 1990s working the messy scene between globalized parts of the world what i call the core and the gap .
we have a brain for one reason and one reason only , and that &apos;s to produce adaptable and complex movements .
thank you .
see any common themes ? principles ?
and here we suddenly begin to have a mapping between curvature that we can exploit numerically , a relative mapping between curvature and shape .
if you take the obese mouse and give it an angiogenesis inhibitor , it loses weight .
so that &apos;s push pop press &apos; first title , al gore &apos;s &quot; our choice . &quot;
and of course , i went to see the rebels in the north .
it &apos;s a global trance .
and if the numbers coming in from china are anything like what they look like now , it &apos;s not going to be 40 years .
the growth of the auto industry will be capped by sustainability issues if we don &apos;t solve the problems .
and that proportion is primarily genetically determined .
thank you .
and people would drive up next to me and say , &quot; john , what are you doing ? &quot;
we did our first million-dollars-worth of trade by buying on 30 days and selling on 21 .
if god is a bystander , observing but not involved , then god may well exist , but we don &apos;t want to know about him .
because without that , you can &apos;t have this kind of place , food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape , and is not just a zero-sum commodity off in some unseen hell-hole .
all they needed to do that more quickly and to do it better was a little bit of capital .
we have about 500 people around the world working in our aids program , some of them for nothing -- just for transportation , room and board .

so the team developed new debugging software , where we could test each synthetic fragment to see if it would grow in a background of wild type dna .
and i like that definition , because it enabled me to transfer their mindset into the dataset .
and i want to make it clear , we don &apos;t view this as the complete math education .
this was a very exciting time , developing this with my wonderful afghan team .
we see them come up with more interesting , and just more , ideas so they can choose from better ideas .
a little bit like on this picture here .
we have the tools and technologies now to enable us to take a broader ocean-basin-wide initiative .

we might spend time with people we don &apos;t even like because it &apos;s somehow interesting .
there are many science-based analyses of this , but they all draw the same conclusion -- that we &apos;re living beyond our means .
and that &apos;s not a joke , we really do .
there are people already working on hacking the software of life , and while most of them are doing this to great good and to help us all , some won &apos;t be .

so , because the basic fabric of consciousness is this pure cognitive quality that differentiates it from a stone , there is a possibility for change because all emotions are fleeting .
you can rotate them by a sixth of a turn if you ignore the colors . we &apos;re not matching up the colors .

a lot of people are excited when sharks actually went under the golden gate bridge .

but the fact is , i &apos;ve been lucky to get a chance to perform all over the world , and i did a lot of shows in the middle east .
so , howard rheingold has written a lot about this and , i think , is writing about this more , but this notion of voluntary cooperation is an incredibly powerful one , and one worth thinking about .
so it did take humans to kind of push it one way or another .
and of course , it reaches the viability threshold .
thank you , and god bless .
everything was okay , until i got to about the age of 26 , and i went to a movie called &quot; short circuit . &quot;
but why is the technical overload crisis , the complexity crisis , accelerating now ? in the hardware world , it &apos;s because we the consumers want everything to be smaller , smaller , smaller .

one of the largest collections is called the brain opera .
not for the bush , but for the seeds .

incredible . that was really incredible .
because this is , in some sense , the first way , that people discover their own potential as actors , and discover their own agency .
happy , away i went .
look at the health systems in so many countries .
now this may be a way of saying &quot; pure beings &quot; -- like in angels -- or it may be like the greek kouros or kórē , an eternal youth .

there was all sorts of press coverage , all over the world , going right down to &quot; dr. strangelove saves the earth , &quot; from the economist .
we need , you know , 30 days on 1,000 processors to do the kind of simulation that i showed you before .
now follow me , ok ?
urbanization , integration , coming together , leads to a new renaissance .
so that &apos;s the next layer of simplicity , and , in fact , integrated circuits are really simple in the sense that they , in general , work really well .
and then , of course , people from san fransisco saw it .
the reality , unfortunately , is a little different , and it has a lot to do with trust , or a lack of it .
and then we know that if we sprinkle drano around the kitchen , that helps .
the only grain of truth to this complaint that the arts are in decline come from three spheres .

people in very different cultures all over the world tend to like a particular kind of landscape , a landscape that just happens to be similar to the pleistocene savannas where we evolved .

ninth you see , family is ... it &apos;s awful .

you can walk up to your local school and consult with the teachers . they &apos;ll always tell you how to help .

when we realized how much expensive it is to have a lot of neurons in the brain , i figured , maybe there &apos;s a simple reason .
it took me three years to publish that .
and number five : i wish i &apos;d lived a life true to my dreams , instead of what others expected of me .
but that &apos;s what he had all his life , people walking away from him .
information technology grows in an exponential manner .
our expectations of what the oceans can produce is something that we don &apos;t really appreciate because we haven &apos;t seen it in our lifetimes .
so , we &apos;ve been conducting a lot of research .
and we call that the meme-ome .
so , it took the universe 11 billion years to build the brain .
twenty-four hours later , my social worker , this strange man who used to visit me every couple of months , he &apos;s waiting for me in the car as i say goodbye to my parents .
the sources of human problems have to do with egotism , &quot; i. &quot;

you all know about embryonic stem cells .
but perhaps they knew that on sixth , november , 2009 , there will be a ted green and blue session , so they painted it like this .
let &apos;s see if you can get something else . &quot; and we got the bear surrendered to -- we set up a sanctuary . we have four sanctuaries in india .
i just want to briefly highlight , the blue rods are the scores of microscopy only at the five clinics in dar es salaam on a population of 500,000 people , where 15,000 reported to get a test done .
thank you .
so will evil prevail ? is that the question ?
that &apos;s the scary part .
and then i thought about how , much as travel insurance doesn &apos;t cover acts of god , probably my health insurance did not cover acts of idiocy .
but knowing my father , and how he kept saying that he was a pacifist and non-violent , i found it very hard to picture him with a helmet and gun .
so , 27 years ago i got a traffic ticket that got me thinking .
i came with a plan .
this is 59 seconds into the film .
i walked up to ashland , oregon , where they were offering an environmental studies degree .
it &apos;s illuminating the space .
now , the offenders , they also benefit .
i &apos;ve not been home for quite a while , for about five years now .
will i not make enough money ?
they got on a boat , and yet another divergence -- the boat was either going to canada or to australia .
everything that is done to treat burn -- basically we do a sodding approach .
and that is the same reef ; that &apos;s the same reef 15 years ago ; that &apos;s the same reef today .
i am connected to everything and everyone . i was born like that .
but this is blinking all the time . it &apos;s sending signals in real time .
and we learn and adapt the program accordingly .
this is fulla . fulla is the arab world &apos;s answer to barbie .
and i wanted , through color and large format cameras and very large prints , to make a body of work that somehow became symbols of our use of the landscape , how we use the land .
pm : there is a lot of energy here . lots of learning .
i don &apos;t know how to put this .

the winner boxes the air and kisses the ground , throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it .
people worry about overpopulation ; they say , &quot; well , if we fix aging , no one &apos;s going to die to speak of , or at least the death toll is going to be much lower , only from crossing st. giles carelessly .

our team -- and we have a team of experts that go out -- we went out 20 times in the old-growth forest last year .
this is a klein bottle .
look what we &apos;ve ...
there is so much diversity around the globe .
getting the groceries in from the car , up the stairs , into the kitchen .
could it be that with those more distant things , it &apos;s not a token for one second , it &apos;s something that is many steps removed from money for a much longer time -- could it be that people will cheat even more ?
10 years after that military intervention , that country is far from secure .
we talk of people as human capital .
america has paid me . i never forget where i came from .
it &apos;s the most tropical country in the world , a marshland on the equator .
but they vary even more , possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet in the extremes .
and back here in the united states , we saw economic despair , deprivation .
there &apos;s not enough tax revenue , there &apos;s not enough philanthropic donations , to deal with these problems the way we &apos;re dealing with them now .
basically , when i look at my partner radiant and confident , probably the biggest turn-on across the board .
so here &apos;s a great puzzle : in a universe ruled by the second law of thermodynamics , how is it possible to generate the sort of complexity i &apos;ve described , the sort of complexity represented by you and me and the convention center ?
we conventionally divide space into private and public realms , and we know these legal distinctions very well because we &apos;ve become experts at protecting our private property and private space .
but i can offer some natural light and year-round climate control .
so that we actually , to test this idea , first took a look at amino acids and some other carboxylic acids .
there are thousands upon thousands of different kinds of microbes on us .
it all began with a fantastic phone call .
now just because we have a distributed foot and spines doesn &apos;t mean you can climb vertical surfaces .
now a new generation is opening up the world as well .
so it &apos;s not a theory of everything . and in fact , a huge amount of the information in the universe around us comes from those accidents , and not just from the fundamental laws .
and i got several answers , and i accepted the one which was farthest from home and practically , i thought , halfway to america .
we &apos;ve been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about 15 years to approach a whole range of topics , particularly in cardiovascular disease .
and it &apos;s really different within each country .
now , this situation changed , of course , after 9-11 , because george bush launched the war on terror .
no other evidence .
it &apos;s all right there .
return to the army .
he went from being a glorified dogcatcher to completely transforming the community .
i met with david to talk about what i might do in his company .
i painted myself white one day , stood on a box , put a hat or a can at my feet , and when someone came by and dropped in money , i handed them a flower and some intense eye contact .

ph.d. &apos; s just flock into this little room , and they &apos;re just firing these questions at me , and by the end , i kind of felt like i was in a clown car .
now , fincher is an interesting guy .
because if you don &apos;t have that sameness , physiologically , you &apos;re going to be sick or you &apos;re going to die .
the problem with this is that essentially what you end up getting after a while is the wisdom of the flock .
what ?
who &apos;s got the dangerous troublemaker view ?
and it &apos;s not just a matter of glamorizing cleaning your floor .
first of all , how good is it ? well , it &apos;s pretty good . it isn &apos;t perfect , but it &apos;s much , much better than you would expect , given our completely chaotic model .
and we &apos;re looking ahead at generations who really need us to retool our lives now .
this robot is called climber : cable-suspended limbed intelligent matching behavior robot .
biological nutrition can supply about 500 million humans , which means that if we all wore birkenstocks and cotton , the world would run out of cork and dry up .
that &apos;s the current business model .
i &apos;ve always liked to draw , so i &apos;m doing it more even though i &apos;m really very bad at it .
i do this all day long . i want to write something else .
i don &apos;t think that chamber has evolved because of me and my backhoe and my crew of students with pickaxes , but instead because when there &apos;s flooding , occasionally the colony has to go down deep .
i &apos;d just love to be put in front of some of the most amazing movers and shakers in america . &quot;
so , way back in the early times of the universe , we believe it was very simple and understandable .
one of my dream acquisitions , which has been on hold for a few years but now will come back on the front burner , is a 747 .
dg : you can see , here &apos;s a crab that lives down there .
and i wrote this book , &quot; the laws of simplicity . &quot;
i tend to think that it comes out of our shared humanity , out of our togetherness , and i think it &apos;s pretty cool .
this is a whale that just squeaked by a rapidly moving container ship and avoided collision .
but if you look at that same index of health and social problems in relation to gnp per capita , gross national income , there &apos;s nothing there , no correlation anymore .
hence the violence .
that means every bad loan goes bad 47 times over .
but just as important is knowing which details we should leave out so that the main point still comes across .
so you &apos;re going to be in charge , you &apos;re going to be in control , you &apos;re going to be in the driver &apos;s seat .
but don &apos;t we already know what we need to know about greenhouse gases ?
i &apos;m a good provider , too .
let &apos;s not hype the threat ; let &apos;s actually see it clearly .
we want others to be better than we were , and indeed , others have been better .
so soybeans have really exploded , showing how trade and globalization are really responsible for the connections to rainforests and the amazon -- an incredibly strange and interconnected world that we have today .
i remember , for some reason , that they were exactly the same height .
when we include these , each matter particle has two different spin charges , spin-up and spin-down .
here i am , playing the part of the mad scientist , working with the bugs at ucl in london , trying to solidify them .
he had some very complex models of how to survive .
and this is the same thing , money down there , and health , you know ?
what i &apos;m most curious about is , how is a species that &apos;s as smart as we are capable of such bad and such consistent errors all the time ?
so as you can imagine , that &apos;s expensive and a little bit dangerous .
you could develop nausea , headache , your muscles could feel like they &apos;re contracting , and you could actually feel like your bones are breaking .
bp : no need to be . there &apos;s nothing wrong with old age .
she chased that big seal away , went and got its penguin and brought it to me .
this person , whom we met -- and you will see it on the website , www.sristi.org -- this tribal person , he had a wish .
and then we use this to do a variety of things -- like , for example , this film .
and i &apos;d like to bring that experience to the desktop .

the stories that we tell -- what we push out -- becomes who we are .

it &apos;s a material hardener and synthetic estrogen that &apos;s found in the lining of canned foods and some plastics .
okay .
and the americans : &quot; ah , he &apos;s a knucklehead .
so i was flipping through the pages of the times of india when i saw that the prime minister of india was visiting my home town , bangalore .
you can use , actually , scaffolds , biomaterials -- they &apos;re like the piece of your blouse or your shirt -- but specific materials you can actually implant in patients and they will do well and help you regenerate .
rb : so , when i turned 50 , somebody took me outside the boardroom and said , &quot; look richard , here &apos;s a -- let me draw on a diagram .

the object on the right is made from a confection of different substances , from silicon and metal and plastic and so on .
the queen just lays the eggs . there &apos;s no management .
shame is an epidemic in our culture .
supply , demand , big opportunity .
so what we see is with these and other new materials that we can do things with different properties -- lighter , stronger -- and apply these new materials to the environmental problems .
and we don &apos;t have a huge number of people who got infected and never developed disease .
if i made the leap into these new technologies , then how did we -- what happened before that ?
so my usual question is , what do you mean by &quot; basics ? &quot;
so here &apos;s the thing .
it really started from the destruction of the idea that the government is there because it &apos;s our government , meant to protect the larger public interest .
with pisa , we wanted to measure how they actually deliver equity , in terms of ensuring that people from different social backgrounds have equal chances .

one year ago to this very day , i woke up .
but here she had been living in a nunnery for the last seven years .

myshkin ingawale : a blood test without bleeding
women start off whole , don &apos;t we ?
and he &apos;ll improvise entire concerts and he &apos;ll never play it exactly the same way again , and so , as a form of intense creativity , i think this is a great example .
i no longer want anybody to be invisible .
that &apos;s because the size of the brain usually follows the size of the body .
brotherly tempers started to get strained .
i wanted it all -- home office , sit down dinner for 10 , room for guests , and all my kite surfing gear .
and hopefully , any inventor , anywhere in the world , will be able , in the moment of creation , to type in , &quot; how does nature remove salt from water ? &quot;
synesthesia runs in families , so galton said this is a hereditary basis , a genetic basis .
this is the spectrum of the sun -- 24,000 spectral lines , and about 15 percent of these lines is not yet identified .
so it went on like that , and i didn &apos;t know where else to find myself .
but when you look at other types of crashes , like rear-impact crashes , indeed , the car seats don &apos;t perform as well .
this was one of our first patients , chris .
culture &apos;s a very important tool to bring people together .
so i had 50 overall summaries done .
i want to talk about what is happening now in our scientific , biotechnological culture , where , for really the first time in history , we have the power to design bodies , to design animal bodies , to design human bodies .
another thing is that these leaders are a reflection of our society .
i live in new york now . just this week , posters have gone up in subway stations in new york that describe jihad as savage .
&quot; no . no . no one is in charge .
it &apos;s actually just launched , actually launched on valentine &apos;s day , february 14 , about 10 days ago .
&quot; you get her . &quot; &quot; no , no , you take her . &quot;
you can see it in this case -- that &apos;s lighting this led .
and you go through the woman &apos;s vagina . &quot;
it &apos;s basically why you need the qubit , because it only has two ideas .
when we first gave it to them in their enclosures , they actually kind of picked them up , looked at them .
so now we can look throughout the brain .
ep : okay , so you &apos;re showing now some public services .
