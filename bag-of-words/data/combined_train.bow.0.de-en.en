that &apos;s what we do for most problems -- in math and physics , even in social policy -- we slice them into smaller , more manageable problems .
i had never swum in water of minus 1.7 degrees before , because it &apos;s just impossible to train in those types of conditions .
if i do like you , i give you one cow and many other things and we become friends .
so , kind of a weird combination of high-tech and low-tech .
let &apos;s begin by winding the timeline back 13.7 billion years , to the beginning of time .
if i was tired , i drank more espressos .
jim fallon : exploring the mind of a killer
if it is the case , ladies and gentlemen -- and it is -- that we are now locked together in a way that has never been quite the same before , then it &apos;s also the case that we share a destiny with each other .
and then the second step is to say , &quot; the situation is admittedly dangerous , but only for a short time . &quot;
this is people designing their own experiences .
hello .
e : happy birthday to you .
as a continent , here are our priorities .
well , as an environmentalist , we would rather that didn &apos;t happen .
she didn &apos;t speak to me for a very long time , because she thought i &apos;d let my family down .
now , put it this way : what ways of thinking about justice and morality underlie the arguments we have over marriage ?
think about how powerful that is if you &apos;re trying to encourage fuel efficiency .
and none of those problems could i have dealt with , but i have a really bright research team .
he said , &quot; long story .
when it came to our atmosphere , however , it wasn &apos;t that much of a joke over the long term , because it turned out that we were losing oxygen , quite a lot of oxygen .
it &apos;s in that context that i rescue children .
and i go to see a famous magician and proudly ask him , &quot; well what do you think ? &quot;
i grew up at a time when iconic actors from kuwait , syria , egypt used laughter to unite the region , just as football can .
in my husband &apos;s homeland in the highlands of sulawesi island in eastern indonesia , there is a community of people that experience death not as a singular event but as a gradual social process .

he wanted a bigger band .
&quot; i &apos;m coming . &quot; italian hand signals follow .
audience : fold . js : really loud .
essentially it &apos;s propaganda .
it &apos;s the same for the first two parts of the sequence .
it &apos;s freezing cold , and that thin air really gets you .
and i looked at it , just said , &quot; yuck , &quot; and go and work on the other side of the island .
my parents were fanatics about learning , and i &apos;ll come back to that a little bit later .
and then , 15 years after looking at linux and figuring out how the community worked , he said , &quot; i think i know how to write a version control system for free people . &quot;
what i have here is a cinder block that we &apos;ve coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material .
i don &apos;t know of one in the world , and the opportunity is there to transform our experience in our cities .
we are now not just reading genomes ; we are writing them .
and this is one of many ways that we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period .
got a good pilot , brian allen , to operate it , and finally , succeeded . but unfortunately , about 65,000 dollars was spent on the project .
when i came home off that elephant , do you know what the most amazing part was ?
so that was a factor-100 saving .
and i think that is really the nature of architecture .
we have almost 14 million roots .
if you don &apos;t get an opening shock , you don &apos;t get a parachute -- you &apos;ve got a whole new problem set .
and it &apos;s even cruel to think of anything like this .
in cleveland , there &apos;s burnham mall , on the left .
for instance , this is herbert with his grandmother .
and social business needs markets , and there are some issues for which you just can &apos;t develop the kind of money measures that you need for a market .
we get people coming to the foundation all the time .
what did you want to be when you were little ? do you love what you do ?
by the way , the secret is not to go to sleep until you &apos;ve written your words for the day .
now , it &apos;s hard to program a robot to do delicate things like this , but it turns out my colleague , pieter abbeel , who &apos;s here at berkeley , has develeloped a new set of techniques for teaching robots from example .
artificial retinas , the ability to put these arrays on the back of the eyeball and allow the blind to see .
you don &apos;t have that kind of fine control with conventional leather .
it &apos;s a great source of stem cells .
so we &apos;re zooming in here just to show you a little bit of it .
i imagined in my head , a kind of long line of individuals that were never going away , that would always be with us .
the point is that education doesn &apos;t actually work by teaching you things .
i showed him and maria a zooplankton trawl from the gyre north of hawaii with more plastic than plankton .
but the dirty production , the burning of toxins , the lack of environmental standards in asia is actually creating so much dirty air pollution it &apos;s coming across the ocean and has erased our gains here in california .
rainfall is up .
this is cuba , and this is the recycling of a squeaky toy as a bicycle bell , and this is a raincoat that is made out of rice sacks .
i &apos;ve tried to work out which is bigger , and it &apos;s almost impossible .
when my father and i started a company to 3d print human tissues and organs , some people initially thought we were a little crazy .
there are words that we &apos;re truly afraid of .
we all need help , even those of us who are very seasoned .
i think that something needs to be done about this .
so some people got this slip of paper and five dollars .
and these people , a handful of people , have been working for 20 years , looking for particles that may or may not exist .
so an x-ray comes in in the diagram on the left and it knocks out an electron from the inner shell of an atom .
now , if you think about how our world got so accelerated , the usual suspects rear their heads .
after the war , you tear that up , you put 100,000 troops in europe for over 40 years .
read that great piece in the new yorker about how our echo boomers , 19 to 25 , over in iraq taught each other how to do sys admin work , over the internet in chat rooms .
it &apos;s actually functioning as a paddle even though it &apos;s interacting with a surface that we normally think of as a solid .
and i would like it to be ethiopia .
and in fact , i think we &apos;re even wrong when we talk about cancer as a thing .
so , i got my hands on that chemical , filled the sink up with it , and stuck my face in the sink and tried to breathe that in , which was really impossible .
they didn &apos;t have sparklers . but , they -- -- you can make up rules , but they have to relate only to the things that you &apos;ve been able to demonstrate .
this destructive power takes many different forms .
but whichever it turns out to be , there is one thing i &apos;m sure of : the journey will be full of surprises .
the combination of spin , on the one hand , and the internet on the other .
it hits very close to home .
there &apos;s a long history in astronomy of unlikely things turning out to be there . and i mean , the finest example of that was radio astronomy as a whole .
it &apos;s called &quot; helios &quot; -- helios from the sun .
that &apos;s great . i need help with this one .
it &apos;s a kiva , and larry &apos;s putting some water in there , and it works much better than a fish .
who are the cast of characters ? what &apos;s the costume ?

they really enjoyed each other &apos;s company .
the storm was so fierce that we had to lay , fully dressed , fully equipped , laid out on the tent floor to stop the tent from blowing off the mountain .
thirty-five to 50 percent of women forget oral rehydration therapy , they are increasing -- they are actually making their child more likely to die through their actions .
the worse that it is for us , the better that it is for this fundraising .
it &apos;s pretty extraordinary .
you know it &apos;s going to really transform how we feel about travel , and it will also , i think , enhance our freedom of mobility .
well , there &apos;s a lot of know-how out there .
well , why don &apos;t we first say to those helping us out , &quot; don &apos;t be shy about infrastructure .
and let &apos;s understand : this is not an incremental sort of change .
first thing to notice is , half of them do not even have access to a 401 plan .
and the reason he would do that kind of thing is because he understood it feels so much better to stand there and say , &quot; here in my own little world , i am a god , i understand everything .
this was going to be superman , or it wasn &apos;t worth my time or their money .
and this is what we discovered .
put it in the shower , or in the closet , but not in the foyer .
what do we typically finance ?
so it &apos;s not multi-touch as a whole that &apos;s patented .
thank you . it &apos;s really an honor and a privilege to be here spending my last day as a teenager .
it stands for mutually assured destruction .
so , i met the man , walked in his office , and saw these posters and magazine covers of people he has coached .
how can we tell this woman that she ain &apos;t going to have a washing machine ?
meat is a very different story because , of course , animals could walk into the city .
because i want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible .
it turned out , in every single case , they came out of the indian educational system .
i had a kid one day come into my class having been stabbed the night before .
i suggested it and people said , &quot; no no no .
however , an 18 year-old trying to start a school is not easy unless you have a big patron or a big supporter .
so we all get a very distorted picture of reality .
the way we transmit wireless data is by using electromagnetic waves -- in particular , radio waves .
and she goes inside , and woman comes up to her and says , &quot; welcome to mothers2mothers .

i was born in 1976 .
it was very obvious , from the very beginning , that she was a leader .
here &apos;s another one . this is from a game called &quot; food force , &quot; which is a game that teaches children how to run a refugee camp .
when we measure corporate performances , we don &apos;t include our impacts on nature and what our business costs society .
if you think that , plato &apos;s not your guy .
and this was the first prototype in korea , as we &apos;re dealing with a dynamic envelope , and then the same characteristic of the fabric .
aside from alex ross &apos;s style , which is very glamorous , one thing about superman is he makes you believe that a man can fly .
and the book is called &quot; the garden of priapus . &quot;
and the real problem with the global supply chain is that it &apos;s supranational .
because she has been suffering from a superbug called c. diff , and it &apos;s resistant to antibiotics in many cases .
but julián le barón keeps working and he has been mobilizing communities in chihuahua for over a year .
working on projects that actually have visible impacts , like a book for a deceased german artist whose widow came to us with the requirement to make her late husband famous .
so , we &apos;re talking about things like inflatable liners that can conform to the complex topological shape on the inside of a cave , foamed-in-place airlocks to deal with this complex topology , various ways of getting breathing gases made from the intrinsic materials of these bodies .
prior to world war ii , they were making 1000 planes a year .
they &apos;ve been watching too much &quot; terminator . &quot;
human societies got larger , denser , more interconnected .
i usually say to people , when they say , &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
and they had those expectations because agent metaphors imply the deliberate action of a living thing pursuing a goal .
people were walking around obsessed .
so this is a different approach .
but when you &apos;re down here , where the psycho milts of the world are adding one photo at a time , that &apos;s institution as obstacle .
by now i know you &apos;re dying to know what it is and where you can get one .
girl : holly .
we &apos;re comfortable with it needing some tweaks , but we want to keep it .
it wasn &apos;t till -- huygens had two things .
because simple answers may emerge .

a victor in a thousand contests , three great civil rights laws , medicare , aid to education .
these kids did a little graffiti on their desks , and then they signed up for two extra courses .
you can see easily that all the oily water just goes over the back of the boom .

the russians bombarded grozny constantly for weeks , killing mainly the civilians who were still trapped inside .
first , they tend to work in markets where people make one , two , three dollars a day and they are making all of their decisions within that income level .
we simply couldn &apos;t capture it on video .
but he says that he has yet to experience someone who became more aware of their body , in all its frailty and its grace , without , at the same time , becoming more compassionate towards all of life .

so i was arrested quite early in stalin &apos;s purges , and spent 16 months in a russian prison .
and this is a sheet of acrylic infused with colorless light-diffusing particles .
one day my father introduced me to my sister .
i mean , you have the typical european cities , with a dense urban core , good public transportation mostly , not a lot of road capacity .
we exercise these prior to implantation .
another reason is our american emphasis on the virtues of self-reliance and independence , so we instinctively look down on older people who are no longer self-reliant and independent .
this peers , inc. concept is in a very difficult and complex realm .
and here &apos;s this really sophisticated technology coming down the road , all these associated social , moral , ethical questions , and we scientists are just lousy at explaining to the public just exactly what it is we &apos;re doing in those labs .
finally , we have contextual communication .
so unrealistic optimism can lead to risky behavior , to financial collapse , to faulty planning .
here &apos;s the data for 1,100 canadians .
case in point , einstein .
that was the one that i studied .
i felt this tap on my shoulder , and i turned around to see this giant girl in a hoodie sweatshirt emerge from the crowd .
that &apos;s where i got reacquainted with abraham maslow &apos;s &quot; hierarchy of needs . &quot;
however , it &apos;s hard sometimes to remember the extent of that urbanization .
number two , very quickly : how do you solve global climate change when we don &apos;t even have a national energy policy in this country and when gridlock in congress seems to be the norm ?
so when the storm is coming up , it drives a pin into the ground .
it &apos;s reached about seven-and-a-half million human feelings now .
one is well known : untestable theories .
so this is one that they found , they called the knife , the carnival , the boston shuffler , twilight .
they scan each individual x-ray .
no ? now ?
i &apos;m talking about losing it in the same way that we lost the dinosaurs : actually losing it , never to be seen again .
and then you finally get squatter homes like this , which is built on the suburban model .
and they &apos;re creating -- you can think of it as a kind of wallpaper .
so , that pathologist is just like looking at this plastic bottle .
okay , now this gives one a little pause .
chad showed me how easy it is to purchase and fly aerial drones .
let &apos;s not talk about breastfeeding .
bless you . thank you very much .
we are losing species from the earth faster than the dinosaurs disappeared , and leading that loss are amphibians .
music for me was more than a passion . it was obsession .
there &apos;s five to 10 times more wind available worldwide than we need for all the world .
the paper apologized but said it never runs photos of women .

so the college works following the lifestyle and workstyle of mahatma gandhi .
they would get dentures , and if you got dentures , you weren &apos;t going to be able to eat corn-on-the-cob , you &apos;ll eat mush for the rest of your life .
you can see that it &apos;s like three billion missing here .
zoom into it and see where it was taken .
i used to work , also while at microsoft , at a leading restaurant in seattle , so i do a lot of cooking .
&quot; can the brain build such a perception ? &quot;
at first , we were safe in the camp .
this is the picture taken at eight kilometers , ok ? again , the shoreline .
then we &apos;d had 100 years of modern rain science , and that had accelerated desertification , as we first discovered in africa and then confirmed in the united states , and as you see in this picture of land managed by the federal government .
these are potential sources for high-speed data transmission .
but we can push this idea further .
another one was an interactive project where , when you moved the mouse over the letters of &quot; happy mom day , &quot; it reveals a special happy mother &apos;s day slogan .
god cannot be glamorous because god is omnipotent , omniscient -- too far above us .
you know , 20 years before it was still , &quot; ask not what you can do , &quot; but with reagan , it &apos;s , &quot; that &apos;s where , there &apos;s nancy and i , &quot; that kind of language .
let &apos;s take meritocracy .
&quot; oh yeah . &quot; hundred percent .
so i could do more large-scale projects .
no , i think that &apos;s wrong .
the rocket engine begins .
the reason is there &apos;s a separate pathway going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers , and that &apos;s not been cut by the accident .
they all showed this strange sort of skating gait that they adopted once the bridge started to move .
they don &apos;t want legal distinctions between legal and illegal sharing .

in the 1930s , if any of you wanted to make a movie , you had to work for warner brothers or rko because who could afford a movie set and lighting equipment and editing equipment and scoring and more ?
he kept it to himself for 30 years .
they thought you just wear out , there &apos;s nothing you can do about it -- kind of like an old shoe .
this is the only equation in the talk by the way .
20 billion dollars of this material is produced every year , in everything from building materials to surfboards to coffee cups to table tops .
the tricky part is the implementation .
rodney mullen : that &apos;s a good question .
so this work was a real technical challenge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our works , over years to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics .
in a second i &apos;m going to show you a slow motion of a single firefly so that you can get a sense . this is a single frame .
ghanaian economist george ayittey unleashes a torrent of controlled anger toward corrupt leaders in africa -- and calls on the &quot; cheetah generation &quot; to take back the continent .
of course , there were kids who had to .
and it doesn &apos;t even get tired of grading the same work multiple times , we &apos;ve seen that in many of the examples that i &apos;ve shown you .
martin seligman : the new era of positive psychology
this is looking directly across the street from where they were standing .
because when people all share values , when people all share morals , they become a team , and once you engage the psychology of teams , it shuts down open-minded thinking .
you know , innovators , the entrepreneurs out there , you know that when you &apos;re going for a goal , the first thing you have to do is believe that you can do it yourself .
they are more expensive in places like north america .
we &apos;re doing great . we &apos;re doing fine .
because it &apos;s actually not that hideous .
a retired school teacher , there she is with a social security administrator .
it &apos;s a human and technological revolution .
but he did have one suggestion .
milo : i could just squish it .
hourly simulations show that largely or wholly renewable grids can deliver highly reliable power when they &apos;re forecasted , integrated and diversified by both type and location .
but that in fact seemed to be the case .
now , this is really special cork , and this cork is what &apos;s going to protect us from the violent atmospheric entry that we &apos;re about to experience .
now , why is this story important ?
today i &apos;ll be focusing on a major problem that is linked to phosphorus .
the exception was japan .
which is why phil morrison calls seti , &quot; the archaeology of the future . &quot;
and one of the major things we can do we &apos;ve talked a bit about here today is moving the curve to the left .
this first challenge is what i refer to as the persuasion challenge .
but you will remain one of the most important superpowers , and the most hopeful superpower , for the time to be .
autism creates itself .
let &apos;s look at a couple of quick examples .
my sister was struggling to get through undergrad .
he changed exactly one word : &quot; heidi &quot; to &quot; howard . &quot;
this is a photographer &apos;s light box application .
another irony , the double irony is that on the figs and the olives , eduardo can make more money selling those than he can on the foie gras .
now here we go in to the -- la la la , off to work .
and how do we do that ?
and i think this is actually a shrimp that &apos;s releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water .
because nobody &apos;s ever climbed an 8,000-meter peak without oxygen that doesn &apos;t have an ace gene .
the decompiculture society shares a vision of a cultural shift , from our current culture of death denial and body preservation to one of decompiculture , a radical acceptance of death and decomposition .
now visual expression is just one form of culture integration .

they all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism .
now , what we were trying to understand was , is this true ?
similarly , when you put motor output on movement output , it &apos;s extremely noisy .
and probably the easiest way to show you that , is to show you this graph .
so , they poke at it and peck at it and whatnot .
but i realized that what i really needed to know i couldn &apos;t get from training courses .
halfway up the bank , a young teenage elephant came in behind her , and he propped his trunk underneath her , and he began to shovel her up the bank .
people are less happy when they &apos;re mind-wandering no matter what they &apos;re doing . for example , people don &apos;t really like commuting to work very much .
we imagine there are only two choices : either full engagement and troop deployment or total isolation .
sb : thank you . i scared myself .
now , none of you is a martian . how did you do that ?
when ugly jerry was around , jerry was popular .
and i believe dean kamen presented it at ted a few years ago .
the mediatheque has something like 16 stations where the public can get onto the server and look at digital artworks or also curated artworks off the web .
and i think this is largely what &apos;s behind the crisis of legitimacy in our different governments right now .
we find that if we get them out of institutions and into loving families early on , they recover their developmental delays , and go on to lead normal , happy lives .
and the man knows that he doesn &apos;t have to do any digging to get roots .
any time perspective in excess has more negatives than positives .

the first year we got nothing .
again , sanitation and water is incredibly important , but it also costs a lot of infrastructure .
it &apos;s a part of the spiritual world .
i just came to my senses , obviously .
if you look at the scene , egypt , for 30 years , had been in a downhill -- going into a downhill .
the pack stays together .
but we don &apos;t just experience them , we show them .
couldn &apos;t actually turn back very much , because if you were king a thousand years ago , while it still took hours and hours and weeks and weeks to traverse your own country , there wasn &apos;t much you were in charge of .
two percent isn &apos;t 20 percent , but in the car business , which is slow moving , that &apos;s huge ; that &apos;s arrival .
and what we &apos;re here to do is not to talk about puerto rico or the past .
votes can &apos;t go missing because then you won &apos;t find yours when you look for it .
step one : woman says , &quot; i want to have a baby . iskam baby . &quot;
we &apos;re going to have a department of something else between war and peace .
but not everything was human , and i will give you a very exciting example .
it &apos;s got a needle , like a record needle , that goes back and forth over the surface , bumps up and down , and feels the height of the first surface .
and i can look at the journey , not just the destination .
everyone &apos;s a bit psychopathic . &quot;
so , you know , by being able to write a genome and plug it into an organism , the software , if you will , changes the hardware .
ts : yeah .
and so i was surprised when i noticed one day that the conservatives had disappeared from my facebook feed .
there &apos;s really no ceremony , rituals , or rites .
it &apos;s a blind computer .
and i have a dream .
they used the same trash to form green manure .
mammography relies on differences in the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue , and we &apos;ve seen that those differences can be obscured in a dense breast .
thank you .
and all of this comes from the architecture of complexity , or the patterns of how things are connected .
what we started to do was to realize that we had to take charge and reform ourselves .
when we share ideas we all get more .
and if you find one , i will say that this is something related to seti , because naturally you can &apos;t do it .
for the past five years , i &apos;ve been taking my wife and kids to southwestern montana , where i worked as a teenager on the hay harvest . and montana , at first sight , seems like the most pristine environment in the united states .
when i &apos;m walking around an art gallery , rooms and rooms full of paintings , after about 15 or 20 minutes , i realize i &apos;m not thinking about the paintings .

marcus du sautoy : symmetry , reality &apos;s riddle
that &apos;s me getting mica .

they are losing up to 30 percent of their business with people leaving shops faster , or just turning around on the door .
it &apos;s becoming , i think , a really great institution .
this is not a product placement . it &apos;s just -- in fact , if i was coca cola , i &apos;d be pretty distressed about this -- -- but basically , this is it .
infection in india .
knowing that she wants to stick a needle in your skin and suck out your blood ? that &apos;s awful , right ?
there are nine billion humans coming our way .
and that &apos;s great when i can degrade the tissue .
and so i &apos;ve figured out , over time , the solution to the depression : you make a friend in every town and you &apos;ll never be lonely .
there is a single candle flickering in the center ; by an arrangement of reflective glasses , it reflects into infinity in all directions .
and yet , the irony is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space .
which is how i ended up having lunch with the scientologists .
but they have two types of gill structures .
there &apos;s no photoshop here .
this is a marketplace , also in kenya , toi market , lots of dealers , in almost everything you want to buy .
second , we need to create the space for what i call &quot; managed dissent . &quot;
em : thank you . that was awesome . that was really , really cool .
i said , &quot; no , i &apos;ve got the best eduction .
optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief , an intellectual posture .
first question : if i want to ask them to call up -- because they do hear them through the ear .
what will that lead to ?
the sun end was about four inches in diameter , and then it tapered over about 35 feet to about a millimeter at the earth end .
and the most important message of roots and shoots is that every single individual makes a difference .
and all those phones were in the few urban places .
ramona pierson : an unexpected place of healing

if he can see this pattern in his own brain , he can learn how to control it .
as you can see , a project evolves through a series of generations of design meetings .
we all know everybody in this room makes mistakes .

the defeated candidate gave up power and made way for ghana to move into a new democratic cycle .

they &apos;re malleable . they &apos;re volatile , and as a result , we all need to remember to be cautious , that the accuracy of our memories is not measured in how vivid they are nor how certain you are that they &apos;re correct .
when you think about it , the oceans are 75 percent of the planet .
i was a 24-year-old young engineer .
so a lot of people have heard about the wikipedia bush-kerry controversy .
yes we can . we can do it .
and i &apos;m not just talking about laws as they relate to people living with hiv , but people who are at greatest risk of infection -- people such as those who inject drugs or sex workers or transgendered persons or migrants or prisoners .
on the left hand side there is a large volcano called axial seamount .
ss : two weeks ago , aimee was up for the arthur ashe award at the espys .
so i have branded myself as a war child .
and these days , people ask me a lot , how did that feel .
i remember a few years ago , i was thinking about all this , and i went to see &quot; the sunday sport , &quot; a tabloid newspaper that i don &apos;t recommend you to start reading if you &apos;re not familiar with it already .
what happened is we had evolved an agricultural economy to a world of big business .
these are just some of the households that we &apos;ve done in the intel studies .
so that ranges from heart disease to malaria , hiv , aids , as well as other forms of cancer -- anything .
this number is small .
so low income here , high income there .
bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate , pet , will sink in seawater and not make it this far from civilization .
and so i managed to fly the balloon down through the clouds , and about 50 feet , before i hit the sea , threw myself over .

susan cain : the power of introverts
each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other .
no , what happened to us , chris , is that power , it &apos;s priced off the margin .

the world &apos;s largest and most devastating environmental and industrial project is situated in the heart of the largest and most intact forest in the world , canada &apos;s boreal forest .
i flew around the world .
and before i left the hospital , after a year of being hospitalized , i had seven ruptures of my carotid artery .
and it turns out to not be very hard .
this is morocco last year in the atlas mountains , training in preparation for some high altitude jumps .
and that &apos;s the power of storytelling .
i &apos;m not real good with math , but i was working on it .
another kind of cell , head direction cells , which i didn &apos;t mention yet , they fire like a compass according to which way you &apos;re facing .
i couldn &apos;t leave the story , and i couldn &apos;t leave the topic either , because everywhere i went i met more of these women who no one seemed to know about , or even wish to .
this was a fly by wire . it has wings .
when i spoke at ted in 1996 , reporting on my studies of the early virtual communities , i said , &quot; those who make the most of their lives on the screen come to it in a spirit of self-reflection . &quot;
women can talk .
and the artist that drew this observation test did some errors , had some mistakes -- there are more or less 12 mistakes .
takes about a minute .
we have a tool that actually helps us out in this study , and that &apos;s the fact that the universe is so incredibly big that it &apos;s a time machine , in a certain sense .
the purpose was to make a crater to excavate the material and see what was underneath the surface of this comet , which we learned quite a bit about .
so we &apos;re going to go out and swing around and look back at this .
after this awful event occurs , rocket gets to decide how she feels about it .
and the therapy is delivered continuously at home , without having to go into the hospital either periodically or continually .
in the developed world it &apos;s on average 80 kilograms per person per year , which goes up to 120 in the united states and a bit lower in some other countries , but on average 80 kilograms per person per year .
so then , once you &apos;ve done that , the next stage is to know what it is .
nothing lights up the brain like play .
upgrades the life for these geese .
so with such large , lightweight pillows , we had much less steel .
anesthesia gave surgeons the freedom to operate .
when &apos;s the last time you really enjoyed just the voice of your friend ?
and in fact , sometimes i feel a little sorry for the chicken on my dinner plate , when i think of how intense this brain system is .
took about two years , because i &apos;m looking for fat-free design .
it &apos;s next to nothing . especially designed for me .
let &apos;s see what we get there .
but more important , the pan-african student body is a continual source of strength , pride and commitment to africa .
and when i was 13 , i had a job at a dressmaker &apos;s shop sewing clothes .
he &apos;ll play it . i don &apos;t know how we &apos;ll react to it , but something will change .

recently , obama has introduced optimism at a sort of time of global financial crisis .
turn that piece of paper that you did the sketch on back over , and you &apos;ll find those 30 circles printed on the piece of paper .
so vitamin d is good for you -- it stops rickets , it prevents calcium metabolism , important stuff .
and so from social networks to sociable robots , we &apos;re designing technologies that will give us the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship .
this is the town hall for the city .
we have to figure out how to make this tradeoff between growing food and having a healthy environment work better .
that &apos;s the first time , as a teacher , that i had heard the word &quot; teach ourselves &quot; said so casually .
kb : thanks for letting me show these .
and should they ever come in contact ...
rules and incentives don &apos;t tell you how to be a good friend , how to be a good parent , how to be a good spouse , or how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer or a good teacher .
i met mandela at the arusha peace talks , and so on and so on and so on -- while i was building the case to prove whether this idea would make sense .
let us not keep them and ourselves in the dark .
today we have technology that lets us express ourselves a great deal , perhaps a little too much .
and abbreviated it to meme , just because it sounds good and made a good meme , an effective spreading meme .
rw : that &apos;s terrific . thank you .
so decades ago , not years ago , i set out to find a place in the world where i could observe dolphins underwater to try to crack the code of their communication system .
if you &apos;re wired to make deals , you make deals .
so that becomes a very powerful force for them to make their brand more elastic .
his name is dr. denis mukwege .
with a 3d visualization like this , we can not only just say voyager 1 flew by saturn .
she took over as executive director .
so i created 10 fake male profiles .
but you should be aware that its use is very much illegal in the united states .
so what seems like a very clunky product is , in fact , incredibly useful .
but then i took a trip to the national museum of natural history .
in order to do that , however , we needed to have a method of distinguishing normal from malignant , and on the left is the single normal cell , human breast , put in three-dimensional gooey gel that has extracellular matrix , it makes all these beautiful structures .
here &apos;s an example of the puzzle you &apos;re going to solve .
i can &apos;t look you in the eyes and tell you that i have a simple solution for that , but i can look you in the eyes and tell you that we can &apos;t solve any of those problems if we don &apos;t have crop diversity .
i hold out hope that we &apos;ll be able to reconcile this conflict with some sort of , some yet uninvented technology .
so what have we learned from all this ?
this is now supposed to be my bacterial cell .
you know , there &apos;s this little child who can &apos;t see , can &apos;t really understand much about the world , has no one in the family who plays an instrument , and yet he taught himself to play that .
this theory and others like it are long shots .
so , i kind of believe that we &apos;re in like the &quot; cave-painting &quot; era of computer interfaces .
so we &apos;ve got about 100,000 pieces up there .
this is an unbelievable light show .
most of you have the intuition that it &apos;s not -- you wouldn &apos;t pay that for it .
j i don &apos;t know . i guess people can see the gross disparity in force .
well , i &apos;ve got to tell you , it &apos;s just not going to be pretty .
and so the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence .
consider for example transporting goods .
three : the secret to high performance isn &apos;t rewards and punishments , but that unseen intrinsic drive -- the drive to do things for their own sake .
i &apos;ll explain what that means . we &apos;re looking at three trends .
the other assumption that you made -- and this little lesson is to show you that you will make assumptions .
this kid needs a lot of work . &quot;
as a friend of mine says , &quot; life is a series of things you &apos;re not quite ready for . &quot;
i can bring home the bacon , fry it up in the pan and never let you forget you &apos;re a man . &quot;
we have to know a little more about the world .
that is , every day , 25,000 children die of entirely preventable causes .
the actual nerve supplying the arm was severed , was cut , by say , a motorcycle accident .
this surgeon has over 3,000 hours of laparoscopic experience .
what we need is information .
and aicha started , and she said , &quot; i don &apos;t know if my son is guilty or innocent , but i want to tell you how sorry i am for what happened to your families .
this has led , in the space of only four years from the time the gene was discovered to the start of a clinical trial , to a test of that very compound .
and i couldn &apos;t wait to trip the mind fantastic .
what &apos;s important though is that writing only emerged about 5,000 years ago . so what that means is that all the people before there was any writing , every word that they ever said , every utterance disappeared . no trace . evanescent . gone .
i think we have their attention .
and i would like to say that life was totally easy with them .
and the strangler says very matter-of-factly , &quot; oh no . if i &apos;d felt the distress , i could not have done it .
the computer learned what the monkey brain did to move its arm in various ways .
so i took the food supply of every single country and i compared it to what was actually likely to be being consumed in each country .
all the peoples that the babylonians had repressed and removed will go home , and they &apos;ll take with them their gods .
while i was doing that work , my mom and my dad , they were looking at it and they said , &quot; why do you deal with negative subjects all the time ? &quot;
i had been steeped in the intelligence on iraq and its wmd , and my testimony to the inquiry said three things : that the government exaggerated the intelligence , which was very clear in all the years i &apos;d read it .
and my answer to kimberly was that what i &apos;m sending is none of your business , and it should be none of your government &apos;s business either .
we now deliver food in over 30 countries over cell phones , transforming even the presence of refugees in countries , and other ways .
there &apos;s a railroad track .
jh : so note how bradley &apos;s petty , moralistic self just dies on the way up the staircase .
i think it has to start with us .
the second question is , who are you connecting ?
the best four minutes of my entire life were those in the olympic stadium .
let &apos;s focus on the conversations between our friends and our family and our coworkers and our loved ones .
300 to 500 million cases are reported .
it &apos;s quite likely in an audience this size this won &apos;t happen to anybody here .
this is a fundamental question that most of us are asking .
why am i asking all of these business questions , instead of just showing them pages ?
our dream is for our partners , our husbands , not to be given to us because of a horoscope , because they &apos;ve been tested for hiv . &quot;
this is not like that . i &apos;m much more like scotty .
we need to understand software as well as just giving someone hardware .
let &apos;s go .
okay . right .
that &apos;s why you need not just be training in one specialty , but also acquire breadth in other fields , related to and even distant from your own initial choice .
they back then , actually , made fortune cookies using very much the similar kind of irons that we saw back in kyoto .
i was in a bit of a spot .
everybody gets involved . it &apos;s just a matter of when the inevitable happens .
i experienced this , not so much as a geographical shift , as a linguistic one .
these are tricky puzzles because your first instinct is to say &quot; tulip , &quot; and then you have to unstick yourself .
we actually just got &quot; middle class &quot; in colorado springs , colorado , but you get the picture .
on the left , i &apos;ve plotted the scores for liberals ; on the right , those for conservatives ; in the middle , the moderates .
and the answer is zero .
both countries are in asia .
it &apos;s not that i didn &apos;t have help , but honestly , i sort of led , i was the team leader .
so that &apos;s no great surprise .
how had i spent my valuable time ?
instead , we prefer these really dazzling technological solutions , which cost a huge amount of money .
and humans dispersed -- not once , but twice .
it &apos;s been known for a long time , you can &apos;t tickle yourself as well as other people can .
if you look at their feet , they have leaf-like structures called linalae with millions of hairs .
for instance , this is another student of mine , susan jackson from australia , who did work with some of the leading athletes in the world .
i grew up amongst those animals .
it doesn &apos;t radiate .
it was very much uncontrollable , and in a certain sense , it seemed to be the extreme of complexity , just a mess , a mess and a mess .
should we do serious research on this topic ?
so , the chinese are very good at these puns and alternative wording and even memes .
and the thing i &apos;m really trying to do is enabling people to have more rich kinds of interactive experiences .
any claim that al qaeda had to being protectors of islam against the western crusaders was drowned in the blood of iraqi muslims .
but the geneticist professor steve jones describes how unilever actually did solve this problem -- trial and error , variation and selection .
and they all took the spotlight , even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to .
it &apos;s about helping people to build lives of dignity , stability , economic autonomy , citizenship .
so it makes sense to want your enemy to be happy , because they &apos;ll stop being your enemy because that &apos;s too much trouble .
and conversely , we older people are not fluent in the technologies essential for surviving in modern society .
there are many kinds of interviews . we know them .
so now -- i always ask , why do i put myself in this position ?
these are very compelling , vivid sensations .
and then , over time , we were able to bring down the cost significantly to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out .
and so i just think , they got their lecture to go to .
so i &apos;m not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up .
so say on the order of tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands of molecules will come together to form a large structure that didn &apos;t exist before .
and we got these overlapping circles . and we found only 173 genes common to all 13 organisms .
so , maybe spraying ddt on crops is a really bad idea .
she said that , first of all , that she didn &apos;t know how to contact me .
they &apos;re exotic . they &apos;re experimental .
wise he was , indeed , but he also had a wonderful sense of humor .
i would pass their sheet of paper .
but immediately the system goes like , &quot; what kind of dumb piece of code was this ?
the final stages , when i ran the samples through a high-pressure liquid chromatography mass spectrometer , which separated the compounds and analyzed the chemicals and told me exactly how much carcinogens i had in my chicken .
she said , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
the strange one looks likes this : that we live in a three-dimensional world .
it has no fresh water that it &apos;s able to drink , but it drinks water out of fog .
and she said , &quot; well , something very weird was happening .
he was an early talker .
but jefferson wasn &apos;t quite right , was he ?
he has this line where he says , you know , you &apos;re going to put up a link there , if you see a link , somebody decided to put it there .
and in the current iran , zoroastrians and christians have guaranteed places in the iranian parliament , something to be very , very proud of .
what you &apos;re going to learn is this .
the next step is to learn the capability to make yourself a scientist .
cancer exploded the wall of my disconnection .
and these decisions affect africa .
so i &apos;ve joined a growing band of people that try to make molecular spells using dna . we use dna because it &apos;s cheaper .
and this virtual object takes 200 real people about 56 days of real time to build , plus countless thousands of hours of effort before that .
but just keep staring at it .
and i said , &quot; well , what , he didn &apos;t want to hang out with the other patients ? &quot;
we then execute that on the robot , we observe what happens , then we adjust the controls using a sequence of techniques called iterative learning .
for so much of my life , i wanted something else to make me happy .
because i could go on for about two hours with evidence of people &apos;s inability to estimate odds and inability to estimate value .
so i was very excited about this .
can we roll the video ?
that one is , more or less , the same type of process .
and you can see , you go inside the family enclosure -- you go inside and here &apos;s pots in the fireplace , stacked recursively .
these are some questions that we &apos;ve yet to ask .
and he said , &quot; well , i &apos;m in truro , &quot; which is where i was , and he asked me out for supper .
it &apos;s embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the west .
one day a nasa manager comes into my office , sits down and says , &quot; can you please tell us , how do we look for life outside earth ? &quot;
how much do i stand to gain from cheating ?
and then we started a new policy -- a new policy completely different .
shame drives two big tapes -- &quot; never good enough &quot; and , if you can talk it out of that one , &quot; who do you think you are ? &quot;
we need to kind of get down and do the gritty work of reducing our dependence upon this fuel and these molecules .
and there &apos;s nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies .
it &apos;s not so much psychological , it &apos;s vascular , and nicotine makes your arteries constrict .
it expresses , but it doesn &apos;t solve , an underlying problem .
i think there &apos;s a belief that it &apos;s just impossible , that you cannot quantify the doings of mankind , that you cannot measure history .
our experience points to an amazing increase in human productivity by over 20 percent by using these plants .
china &apos;s building 300 new cities in the next 20 years .
what has happened in the last 15 years with this work ?
i &apos;m tired of you having to come here , harassing us , while your children are sleeping peacefully in your homes .
so imagine that the operators make their return by building a percentage markup into each transaction .
you can use statistics , or you can use stories .
so i met this character , steven .
this is something that we &apos;re using today to search for e.t. , and the electronics have gotten very much better too .
and the first one , and i &apos;m about to utter a heresy here , none of them exercise , at least the way we think of exercise .
this is the retiree health care benefits .
it &apos;s the end of the conversation for intelligent design creationists .
and this is something that is common to all our big cities .
and she , of course , naturally as a nine-year-old , looked at me and said quizzically , &quot; what &apos;s literacy ? &quot;
and in many places , they &apos;re there .
okay ?
they have figured out everything that &apos;s required to dismantle , take things apart , rewrite the circuitry , re-flash the firmware , do whatever you want to with the phone , and they can fix anything so quickly .
it means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have .
you don &apos;t need the 30-day waiting period .
so for ted we actually built a robot , over there , a prototype , with the tail .
so he had a handful of shrimp , maybe seven or eight shrimp , and all those other animals on the deck of the boat are bycatch .
we have .
so if you keep further down the knowledge map , we &apos;re getting into more advanced arithmetic .
it can get sideways like a rally car driver , always able to take the tightest curve , even on slippery , changing surfaces , never spinning out .
that &apos;s no problem , as most of you know , because i can just delete that dot .
so simplicity and predictability are characteristics of simple things .
and the third kind of project : something for the local environment .
and the very last one is a billboard .
30 percent of our households gave .
how can we have critical thinking without being able to quote and being able to compare what happened in the past ?
lord , i hate to hear that news .
when an artful blob of paint or two , by an artist , suggests a person -- say , one of marvin minsky &apos;s little society of mind -- do they send little painters out to fill in all the details in your brain somewhere ?
and i said , &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
for the longest time people have regarded science and humanities as being distinct .
so i hate to put a timeline on scientific innovation , but the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends .
by 1913 , these 10 countries , plus the united states , controlled vast global empires -- 58 percent of the world &apos;s territory , about the same percentage of its population , and a really huge , nearly three-quarters share of global economic output .
and you just saw motts the research engineer , there , going into the mri system , and he was wearing goggles .
and moving on to some applications developed by developers and researchers around the world , with robots and simple machines , for example -- in this case , flying a toy helicopter simply by thinking &quot; lift &quot; with your mind .
it generates 30 % of greenhouse gas emissions .
i will kill you in the name of allah , wuhahahahaha . &quot;
we had to age the teeth over time .
i had to do something .
i thought i could jazz it up a bit , have a little fun with it .
there is a compound in chocolate called phenethylamine that might be an aphrodisiac .
and i feel humbled by their strength .
kb : thank you .
the wall that kept me , elyn , professor saks , separate from that insane woman hospitalized years past , lay smashed and in ruins . &quot;
i &apos;d like to put this kind of friday night bar discussion aside and get you to actually step into the lab .
and not just in chicago , but in the entire united states .
but cambodia is not alone .
every single one of us , depending on where we &apos;re sitting , will experience this sound quite , quite differently .
so i just want to tell you my story .
a possible mode of being here would be a way of life -- a way of being , experiencing , thinking , seeing , interacting with the world .
thomas friedman is one of my favorite new york times columnists , and he poignantly commented that 2008 is when we hit a wall , when mother nature and the market both said , &quot; no more . &quot;
because the clock is ticking for all of us .
so , there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs .
so that &apos;s the photographs that i wanted to show you .
and look again at this kleiber .
but in china they &apos;re saying , &quot; no , we &apos;re putting in 27 in the next 10 years . &quot;
now , they trade up the politicians every time .
they &apos;re right at the center of the whole thing .
it hardly happens .
so , taxi journeys might be one example .
because now , with this idea we can take a random sample of people , have them nominate their friends , those friends would be more central , and we could do this without having to map the network .
so i thought that it will be good to start with it .
it &apos;s like the lights are on , but nobody &apos;s home on this demographic y2k + 10 problem . right ?
put your arms straight down at your side , look up , open your eyes , stare straight ahead , and speak out your question loudly so everybody can hear .
i think it &apos;s there , and i think we need to go look for it , and i think it &apos;s underground .
but it &apos;s a lion of the sea . it &apos;s a top predator .
and we &apos;ve decided in the next three years , we will double the volume of certified material we put through our business .
these are , indeed , the chronic disorders of young people .
it takes a full eight minutes for its radiation to reach us .
the dark side of the web is allergic to the light .
and many think that these countries are stagnant , but they are not .
we need to confront this fear .
to make law simple so that you feel free , the people in charge have to be free to use their judgment to interpret and apply the law in accord with reasonable social norms .
you &apos;re putting yourself , you &apos;re binding yourself , and you &apos;re weaseling your way out of it , and then you &apos;re beating yourself up afterwards .
and yet , mysteriously , somehow the bee flies .
the search is not for the solution of the problem , but for problems themselves worth solving .
we talk about biofuels that haven &apos;t been invented yet .
now there &apos;s a reason why i study this , versus traditional anthropology .
finally , there &apos;s one of evening primrose that bjorn rorslett from norway sent me -- fantastic hidden pattern .
but it has been amazingly successful in one regard , in that it has become , it has congealed into this endangered people &apos;s movement that was missing in the 20th century .
now , a historian tells me it &apos;s even more difficult to predict about the past .
and when noah had done built his ark ...
now , you might think of flu as just a really bad cold , but it can be a death sentence .
but like i said , haibao looked very familiar , because he is actually the chinese character for &quot; people . &quot;
this single story of africa ultimately comes , i think , from western literature .
a blind man can see that the diamonds end up in his pocket .
we have to teach the kids that the world is not indestructible .
i want to show you a couple of examples why .
there are 1.4 billion different ways that a family can find itself .
so thank you very much .
breast cancer , as we said , kills women , but heart disease kills a whole bunch more .
and i really wanted this story to be about three things : i wanted it to be about abundance , about diversity and about resilience .
this is a creation story , i think , equally as wonderful .
what he was trying to do with me was to inspire me to protect the world , and show me just how fragile the world is .
my mother said , &quot; someone has to . &quot;
and it turns out that when you &apos;re anxious you squirt neural transmitters in the brain , which focuses you makes you depth-first .
here is the chart of over 43 people helping to steer the robot that could not steer and get it on its way , from one corner from one corner of washington square park to another .
derek sivers : keep your goals to yourself
so , this is my latest cooker , and if this looks more complicated than the nuclear reactor , that &apos;s because it is .
and i feel strongly enough about that to make a bet with you : either we &apos;re going to find e.t. in the next two dozen years , or i &apos;ll buy you a cup of coffee .
assuming you live a long life , there &apos;s a 50 percent chance you &apos;ll develop arthritis .
no , no , no , shush . we &apos;ve got to go quickly .
it is made for a diet which is soft , mushy , which is reduced in fibers , which is very easily chewable and digestible .
the millennium bridge was supposed to be the pride of london -- a beautiful new footbridge erected across the thames , first river crossing in over 100 years in london .
governor comes to him one day , actually invites him to come to his office .
now , our big symbol at ideo is actually not so much the place , it &apos;s a thing .
so what are we looking for in a meal ?
we &apos;re all liars .
so before i do that , just one warning , which is that this presentation has been rated &apos; r &apos; by the motion picture association of america .
which brings on another threshold effect i like to call furnace dumping , which is , quite simply , if you have a building that doesn &apos;t need to be heated with a furnace , you save a whole bunch of money up front .
maybe you will cut ? lift .
so this story stayed with me .
and i was so thrilled .
so i thought , well , why can &apos;t we do something like that and create a clean energy jobs race to the top ?
but it &apos;s never going to happen by forcing these organizations to lower their horizons to the demoralizing objective of keeping their overhead low .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re searching for -- when we &apos;re working our craft , we are really trying to find that truth out there .
the first was moral , that psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists , pathologizers , that our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble , bricks fell on you .
when we focus on ourselves in any activity , we do turn that part of ourselves off if there &apos;s another person .
and i was looking at that , trying to figure out what it means .
as eleni has said , when people gain income , they gain choice , and that is fundamental to dignity .
they say , well , we have a thing in a box , and we have its inputs and its outputs .
i called her up .
diabetes i &apos;ve just mentioned . heart failure we already talked about . hypertension : 74 million people could have continuous blood-pressure monitoring to come up with much better management and prevention .
and the rabbi said , &quot; you &apos;ve misunderstood me .
ok , now , do you believe in witchcraft at all ?
it makes the brain inherently robust .
