we published our results in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences and in nature biotechnology .
this was , at a distance , realizing that someone was feeling something , wanting to affect them in a particular way , using media to do it , putting it online and realizing that there was a greater impact .
it &apos;s really important . using applications is ok , but programming is absolutely fundamental .
the war metaphor forces us into thinking that you &apos;re the winner and i lost , even though i gained .
maybe it even got published in a high-profile scientific journal .
i spend as much of my time as possible investigating the marine life .
and i feel very privileged to have stumbled across it living in the maldives .
so this is a story of a place that i now call home .

and as we start to integrate this information , we &apos;re going to know better what to do with it and how better to have insight into our own pathologies , health and wellness .
and no one had systematically looked at the wall tissue .

they &apos;ve been building it so long i don &apos;t remember where it is .
san francisco is also spending 40 million dollars to rethink and redesign its water and sewage treatment , as water outfall pipes like this one can be flooded with seawater , causing backups at the plant , harming the bacteria that are needed to treat the waste .

it was so simple , in fact , that i suspect a really smart high school student , who didn &apos;t even have calculus , could understand what he wrote down .
all right , let &apos;s take a poll , show of hands .
sometimes you get a little star applause , and then i think even bill gates takes a nervous breath , and the talk begins .
thank you .
our calculation shows that quantum tunneling of the higgs field is not likely to occur in the next 10 to the 100 years , and this is a very long time .
because there &apos;s huge opportunities in that .
but i wanted to work only and truly with business and media leadership to totally reframe disability in a way that was exciting and possible .
this is the guy who started the project in my lab , and this is the guy who &apos;s been doing prostate stuff .
anybody ? all right .
it didn &apos;t make them less happy , it just didn &apos;t do much for them .
one of my colleagues in bulgaria , nevena markova , spent about 20 years studying these profiles .
here &apos;s what i was saying about the laws . they &apos;re really there .
and there are thousands of other examples of this happening -- of video-driven evolution of skills , ranging from the physical to the artful .
is this real ? does the language matter , because he &apos;s not supposed to know english ?
we looked at smoking and drinking behavior , and voting behavior , and divorce -- which can spread -- and altruism .
but the man had somehow a lot of room at the bottom .
we have fit over 5,000 amputees , and one of the big indicators we &apos;re looking at , of course , is , does it improve lives ?
from the moment that our ancestors , perhaps two and a half million years ago or so , began imitating , there was a new copying process .
again , opportunity to tackle markets to get that higher price .
i think you matter to god ; i think you matter to history ; i think you matter to this universe .
and so a plan came up to video the vote .
so in 2011 , power shifted , from the few to the many , from oval offices to central squares , from carefully guarded airwaves to open-source networks .
and when you go home , think of what you are going to change in your research on the following day to make their lives better . &quot;
so , the electromagnetic force , the force that holds us together , gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures .
what lies within us can never be truly colonized , contorted , or taken away .
i had been seduced by that potato and not another into planting its -- into spreading its genes , giving it a little bit more habitat .
and if you just look at how technology has been applied , we &apos;ve solved all the long-range , high-speed , high-volume , large-weight problems of moving things around .
sweden was like sierra leone today .
i wanted it to be something that was not addressed to them or signed by me , something that caused them to wonder what on earth this thing was .
so there were 66,000 of these .
and so she thought , well , what the heck .
you &apos;re not making news out of things falling down .
so they knew at that stage they could carry large weights .
and in the worship of my church , the most frequently used adjective about god is &quot; almighty . &quot;
and when i throw this up into the air and catch it , it has the full three-dimensional structure of the protein , all of the intricacies .
let &apos;s take a look .
so , like , ok , maybe it had to do with the patterns on the little pieces of paper -- you know , like , it was a diamond , or , you know , diagonal .
and when i looked at the sequence of the dna , and compared the sequence of jonas &apos; tumor to that of the rest of his body , i discovered that they had a completely different genetic profile .
he wanted a bigger band .
in the moment , that &apos;s what he did .
and as more of us move into cities , more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me -- it &apos;s soybean fields in mato grosso in brazil -- in order to feed us .
it was a phenomenon where young brides were committing suicide in rural gujarat , because they were being forced to bring more and more money for their in-laws &apos; families .

on the far left is a piece of crap -- a replica i bought on ebay .
paul maccready : the wings could touch together on top and not break . we think .
matthieu &apos;s brain scan shows that compassion is not a chore .
and here &apos;s the simplest version in nature , and here &apos;s my collaborator ron fearing &apos;s attempt at an artificial version of this dry adhesive made from polyurethane .
you see , japan did it like that .
so hang in there , and you come up with some pretty peculiar solutions .
there &apos;s a number of mines placed blindly , and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the targets .
it sounds like it was written by an old school teacher of mine .
so we &apos;ve made a silk card with penicillin in it .
i brought it to paul maccready &apos;s company aerovironment to do a feasibility study , and they analyzed it , and came up with a lot of innovative ideas about how to propel it .
this is by jason birdsong .
this , for example , this gentleman is called joseph .
and they support them around the diagnosis and educate them about how to take their medicines , how to take care of themselves , how to take care of their babies .
what are the planetary boundaries within which we can safely operate ? &quot;

and she goes inside , and woman comes up to her and says , &quot; welcome to mothers2mothers .
he can &apos;t walk . anybody know the story ?

i want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight-track tape .
and he pulled it toward him , like so , and he took the knife and he put it on the tip .
harvest bombs .
and the answer i have right here in my pocket , if i get it .
to put that into context , the u.k. government spends about 12 billion pounds a year on foreign aid .

we go back to walter reed , and a kid , literally , 20 some-odd days before that was blown up .
bobby kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message in indianapolis .
and as an architect , i &apos;ve always found these kinds of systems very limiting , because i &apos;m not interested in ideal forms and i &apos;m not interested in optimizing to some perfect moment .
kofi annan said , &quot; this will be beneficial to my troops on the ground . &quot;
and this is the oscilloscope of the whirlwind electronic computer .
you &apos;re thinking , &quot; wikipedia doesn &apos;t say this fact . &quot;
but they &apos;re adapting quickly .
and as you can see , it &apos;s about eight inches in diameter .
so that peak expiratory flow rate , i &apos;ve entered it up into the interactive software model .
well an idea is that that strategy , that learning strategy , is an extremely powerful , great strategy for getting on in the world , but it has one big disadvantage .
i don &apos;t want to write that stuff . &quot;
it &apos;s a pathological , democracy-destroying corruption , because in any system where the members are dependent upon the tiniest fraction of us for their election , that means the tiniest number of us , the tiniest , tiniest number of us , can block reform .
theirs are actually flavored with miso and sesame paste , so they &apos;re not as sweet as our version .
it &apos;s only 200 of us in this room .
after this awful event occurs , rocket gets to decide how she feels about it .

for several days now , panbanisha has not been outside .
i found wal-marts , vacuum cleaners , and lots of food in the cafeteria .
and more co2 causes more warming .

it &apos;s a wonderful day in our country &apos;s history ; it &apos;s a wonderful day in the globe &apos;s history to be able to have an actual sitting president say , enough of this -- first to himself , and then to the rest of the world .
and because it seems that these patterns are passed from one generation to the next , through observation , imitation and practice -- that is a definition of human culture .
and i said , &quot; no , come on . &quot;
so you get a big squeeze .
so i do believe that one of the defining fights of our times will be the fight for the control over personal information , the fight over whether big data will become a force for freedom , rather than a force which will hiddenly manipulate us .
and then we &apos;re off to the races , because i don &apos;t believe for a second that we have forgotten how to solve tough challenges or that we have become too apathetic or hard-hearted to even try .
because they weren &apos;t tracking where the kids were before that .
they are what i consider to be the cities of tomorrow , the new urban world .
there was an fao conference last october that was completely devoted to this .
he did this because he understands data as well as books .
they work by harnessing shoulder power .
i go in their homes . and we do this worldwide , and we follow them around town with video cameras .
literally scrambling through what &apos;s called pressure ice -- the ice had been smashed up under the pressure of the currents of the ocean , the wind and the tides .
so we took a room downstairs in the basement that had been used as sort of an abu ghraib annex .
and i have done this throughout my work .
in red , sort of below oecd average .
they were around me in three directions .
but guys , if history has taught us anything , it &apos;s that if you can imagine it , you will get there eventually .
i don &apos;t think there was ever a day where i cut hair i was nervous .
i mean , when i asked them to summarize the 10 tedtalks at the same time , some took the easy route out .
we especially emphasize areas of great relevance to africa &apos;s development , because , in those areas , scientists working in africa will have a competitive advantage .
or if there was a hole i &apos;d think like , oh damn , there was actually someone thought of that thought already .
that was another thing that really touched me .
but that doesn &apos;t change my belief that all of us , deep inside , here in this room and across this country , share a similar set of desires .
and with our minds we can rationalize anything .
this is not just in hebrew , by the way .
and i explained , &quot; it &apos;s a dark night and a crow is perching on a branch . &quot;
one is : you can &apos;t accommodate everybody .
many people have harmed me in my life , and i remember them all , but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with the people who &apos;ve helped me .
i really get fed up when they , you know , the teachers , especially when you get away from this part of the country , they don &apos;t know what to do with these smart kids .
so in evolutionary scales , movements get better .
and so i made a drawing with a fish , and i left japan .
this was a woman who didn &apos;t have trouble with her eyes , but the visual parts of her brain , a little tumor in the occipital cortex .
and if we don &apos;t have fire , we actually could not live .
i &apos;ll tell you what i think about this and the stock market in a minute .
ew : it was like it was teasing us , doing a kind of fan dance -- now you see me , now you don &apos;t -- and we had four such teasing appearances , and then on the fifth , it came in and totally wowed us .
i know the free market fundamentalists will tell you that more growth , more stuff and nine billion people going shopping is the best we can do .
it &apos;s one of the things that we don &apos;t like to think about , but the fact that religious icons and good luck charms show up on dashboards around the world betrays the fact that we know this to be true .
i think we have their attention .
we don &apos;t necessarily always do it very well , but we have a sense of what the models are , politically and institutionally , to do that .
and it was a house where girls could run away , they could save their clitoris , they wouldn &apos;t be cut , they could go to school .
you know this , if you &apos;re doing something you love , an hour feels like five minutes .
so we are right now doing some systematic field tests to basically ascertain whether something like this actually makes sense to the asha worker .
well thank you . that shot the timing .
now , i don &apos;t know if one of the editors was a woman , but that can make the biggest differences .
i not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls like carnegie hall and kennedy center , but also hospitals , churches , prisons , and restricted facilities for leprosy patients , just to mention a few .
your google science fair champions .
it makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force , which is ultimately good for your brand .
losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden .
when the book became the best-selling book in the world for the last three years , i kind of had my little crisis .
except , you still may not really recognize them , and that &apos;s because we have to work in three dimensions .
but burst-pulsed sounds is a bit of a mystery .
and so we didn &apos;t build any models , and francis sort of continued to work on proteins .
looked first to the courts and the legislatures to try to get them to do something to make the system make more sense .
and how about the long run ?
now , this one is a little bit trickier .
but in this century china is coming on line .
so this great triumph -- it &apos;s so good , there &apos;s almost a religious experience in biology .

and for many of us , our fortunes do indeed lie at the bottom of the pyramid . thank you .
and i was really struck by how much it affected me .
on the other hand , i had played the violin my entire life .

in the northern part of new zealand , i dove in the blue water , where the water &apos;s a little warmer , and photographed animals like this giant sting ray swimming through an underwater canyon .
everything about this illness says i shouldn &apos;t be here , but i am . and i am , i think , for three reasons : first , i &apos;ve had excellent treatment .
when you do this kind of stuff it &apos;s like doing eva .
... and then a catastrophe happened .
that &apos;s sterilizing equipment in nigeria .
people like rashani zafar , who created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country , and is a real role model for women inside and outside the country .
well , remember that &apos;s not even an order of magnitude , but that &apos;s a different story .

nonetheless , our forefathers , right ?
we did about 325 shots .
it &apos;s got this sort of soap opera-like lifestyle ; they have sex , they burrow into your liver , they tunnel into your blood cells ...
in 2010 , renewables other than big hydro , particularly wind and solar cells , got 151 billion dollars of private investment , and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity of nuclear power in the world by adding 60 billion watts in that one year .

so many of these devices really kind of focus on the ways in which we relate to ourselves .
let &apos;s see if you can get something else . &quot; and we got the bear surrendered to -- we set up a sanctuary . we have four sanctuaries in india .
lets develop line ministries of this , that , and the other , that deliver these services .
now this was into august now , and normally sharks peak at june , july .
the one percent will own even more than 40 percent of all the world &apos;s goods and services . not because they &apos;ve grown richer , but because the rest of the world has grown increasingly poorer .
this is the spacecraft taking nine months to get to mars .
now we are able to follow them and find out their secrets , where the babies go after they hatch , and remarkable things like this you &apos;re about to see .
it &apos;s changing our lives in so many ways , and it will continue to do that .
we also heard that 250 billion indian rupees was dedicated for government schooling .
but we &apos;ve found that the way we present our ideas it makes a big difference .

but this mindset has continued to be faithful to the soil and to the land that it emerged from .
satellite television and the internet are informing and empowering young muslims in exciting new ways .
so , the dialogue with the local and the global , the audience as participant and player and protagonist , the innovative use of site , all of these things come to play in the amazing work of the fantastic french company royal de luxe .
the problem with that view is like asking all the winners of lotteries , &quot; have you won the lottery ? &quot;
but 99 percent of chinese microbloggers stand firmly on the embassy &apos;s side .
thank you .
luanda , it was full of land mine victims who were struggling to survive on the streets and war orphans living in sewers under the streets , and a tiny , very wealthy elite who gossiped about shopping trips to brazil and portugal .
flight pilots practice in flight simulators so that they don &apos;t make real mistakes in planes .
so , we believe that on europa there is , in fact , a deep ocean .
what that suggests is that , even in the case of hearing loss , the capacity for music remains .
she did so much . she was a playwright .
now , two weeks ago , that dream took a step forward , when the state of nevada granted google &apos;s self-driving car the very first license for an autonomous vehicle , clearly establishing that it &apos;s legal for them to test it on the roads in nevada .
and also , the easiest one was when i was doing it in form of a music .
so the question is : what are they all doing ?
and here the story is fairly simple .
but not the south africa we always talk about -- the gold , the minerals , the first world infrastructure -- a bit about the other side of it .
they claim to be psychics , or sensitives , whatever they can .

i think that &apos;s wrong , but -- i think it &apos;s right for argumentation . right ?
i also tried to be the safest person i could be , because that &apos;s a part of health .
surfers , for example , know this incredibly .
these are cholera beds in haiti .
they &apos;re difficult integrals .
but for us , the rain is good .
and i said -- i got worried , i said , my god , i mean i &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body image , what about human subjects , ethics and all of that ?
another &quot; associate director of research . &quot;
this is from stanford &apos;s computer science 101 class , and the students are supposed to color-correct that blurry red image .

it had to do with death and disease and lots of other things .
now the reason these micro-entrepreneurs can sell or make a profit is they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow .
you breakdown the molecules , you recombine them in very specific ways , to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day .
i remember my grandfather revising the capitals of the world with me .
so what i did actually is to study this problem , and i found something quite surprising .
his final resting place is a golden globe that contains his ashes at the nikola tesla museum in belgrade .

strangeness is that calibration of closeness and distance that enables me to find the people that i need right now , that enables me to find the sources of intimacy , of discovery , and of inspiration that i need right now .

they owe us , to put a food ambassador in every major supermarket .
it &apos;s this pervasiveness , combined with the centrality to what it means to be a human , the fact that we can tell the truth or make something up , that has fascinated people throughout history .

stephen hanson from sweden .

light is converted to electricity on them .
it surrounds us all the time , just like the air we breathe in this room .

they need to work on their own because that is where deep thought comes from in part .
so they &apos;re spinning these tiny nano fibers of pure cellulose .
this is very early rehearsal footage , but the finished work &apos;s on tour and is actually coming through l.a. in a couple weeks .

now what i learned from her , is a woman , not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then , and what was being done to her son , but the life she &apos;s had .
but after that , i actually had my own lab in the computational neuroscience department , and i wasn &apos;t doing any neuroscience .
and when it &apos;s over , we go to a chinese restaurant and we have a six-course duck dinner .
so i &apos;m not going to go on until every single person in this room , downstairs and in aspen , and everybody else looking , will come to love and understand classical music .

the double income family was the standard .
well , it occurred to me that i should invite dr. robicsek to lecture at wofford college on -- what else ?
we &apos;re looking at the very top of gaya , which is thought to be the oldest redwood .
and this is how you look at africa .
the entire planet is covered by sovereign , independent nation-states .
we still haven &apos;t figured out best how to visualize the data .
i never told anybody to lie , not a single time , never .
but to do it , you need a long , single strand of dna , which is technically very difficult to get .
now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid .
he &apos;s like our other children , but the experience is completely different .
but we aren &apos;t even starting .
and our organization helps women across that bridge .
but i &apos;d want one that could play , too .
i was no longer homeless .
the research guidelines of u.s. national academy of sciences or research councils of the u.k.
and we then coax these cells to produce collagen , as they would naturally .
i said , &quot; stop . this is nuts . &quot;
so they &apos;re restrictive -- don &apos;t use your mobile phone , don &apos;t use your laptop , don &apos;t search the internet , don &apos;t be on i.m.
where other scientists would play in their laboratory , tesla created his inventions in his mind .

i &apos;ve rescued children as young as three years , and i &apos;ve rescued women as old as 40 years .
and these calendars really started to lay out my program .
all around the world climates are mixed up .
annalisa smith-pallotta : that would be -- sage smith-pallotta : -- a real social -- rider smith-pallotta : -- innovation .
it &apos;s just a basic fact about being human that sometimes the self seems to just melt away .
and i was told that i wouldn &apos;t be able to do this , which , you know , as we &apos;ve heard from other people , that &apos;s the thing that makes you do it .
then you have to convince your colleagues .
do we have enough natural gas ?
impressive . thank you .
so we just walked around , and we met a woman , and i showed her my book .
well , very quickly , you get a bright green future for the developing world .
but the point , what i &apos;ve got it down to , is there are only two questions really worth asking .
i wave no flags in my own life .
so on december 4th , i went here .
this tree frog has toes .
this game &apos;s called &quot; spore . &quot; i &apos;ve been working on it for several years .
never mind that i knew nothing about places like namibia .
and you realize that this -- being with these people -- is the flower garden that chiho showed us .
about 600,000 people have taken it in 33 other countries .
these are different wars , with different religious factions , different political factions , and different socioeconomic problems .
so , i was able to launch a three-year project with caritas germany , and we trained 30 afghan women and men , and we opened 15 counseling centers in kabul .

and this is becoming common , it &apos;s moving very quickly , it &apos;s moving in a whole series of places .
so that &apos;s what made me enter &#91; the &#93; college of arts after three attempts and just continue to inquire what i really want to do with art work , or art and finally i &apos;m here in front of you .
so i decided to give it a try .
even though this wasn &apos;t the direction we went because the crank -- it really is stupid to have it on board , by the way .
it is about a country in the southwest of africa called namibia .
i couldn &apos;t read english that well .

that &apos;s where , according to my analyses , the iranians were at the beginning of this year .
this is the largest metropolitan-area disaster in decades , and it was not a natural disaster -- it was a disaster of engineering .
the great thing about our leaders is that , should they not only have passion in their belly , which practically all of them have , they &apos;re also very innovative .

and two or three olympics after that , they are going to be unbeatable .
there &apos;s another woman named agnes . and agnes , for me , epitomizes what a vagina warrior is .
many of you will remember this super cute video from the last ted , but not all quadcopter swarms are so nice and cute .

so when i did the calculations for the lunar data and the solar data at that location on earth at the time of the incident of the shooting , all right , it was well past the end of civil twilight and there was no moon up that night .
they weren &apos;t in a and b at all ; they were completely new texts by archimedes , and they were called &quot; the method &quot; and &quot; the stomachion . &quot;
judge opportunity by how few other students and researchers are on hand .

it is terrestrial skinning .
but the middle class is clearly under huge threat right now .
and when i think about what nathan did , and when i think about what people here do , i think about ideas .
but paper electronics is one of the most promising branches of material science in that it allows us to create cheaper and flexible electronics .
now , usually when people hear statistics or stats like that , you start thinking about places like haiti or other kind of exotic or maybe even impoverished areas , but it happens right here in the united states every single year .
i think this is what so , in fact , infuriated the scientists .
you can focus on past-positive , or past-negative .
you want to tie in to the rest of the world out there .
the reason for that is that these characters are actually not real characters .

you wouldn &apos;t want to have a fear of heights coming down it .
he could have said , &quot; that &apos;s an amazing discovery , guys , and i will improve upon your technology , &quot; but he didn &apos;t .

so let &apos;s say , june , you &apos;re in a village , rural village .
i realized that i had been so immersed in the media coverage of mexicans that they had become one thing in my mind , the abject immigrant .
well , there won &apos;t be any fish except for minnows , and the water will be pretty dirty , and all those kinds of things and full of mercury , etc . , etc .
and they had also been treated with a drug that we made that would attack anthrax in particular , and direct your immune system to it .
of course , from their grandparents and even their great-grandparents .
think about that for a minute : 1.1 billion dollars , 26 years old .
yes . i &apos;m sure ! just change it !
the bad news is that eliminating motivations seems to be incredibly easy , and if we don &apos;t think about it carefully , we might overdo it .
now we are not there yet , but it is happening .
it &apos;s called hutchinson-gilford progeria , and it is the most dramatic form of premature aging .
so , chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force .
so the kids give me the words , right ? i put it into a narrative , which means that this paper is written in kidspeak .

back in the year 2000 , about 100 billion photos were shot worldwide , but only a minuscule proportion of them were actually uploaded online .
rob legato : i pretend they &apos;re clapping for me .
and this one , it &apos;s a large poster , and you touch it and it has a little speaker behind it , and the poster talks to you when you touch it and asks you a series of questions , and it works out your perfect cake .
yet again , the face of starvation at large scale with more than nine million people wondering if they can make it to the next day .
maybe i had better shoot him , before he shoots me , especially since , even if he doesn &apos;t want to kill me , he &apos;s probably worrying right now that i might kill him before he kills me . &quot; and so on .
but i want to explain to you the criteria that we chose for interaction design . aesthetics are really important .
but nothing got people interested in 1950 like the year 1950 .
what you &apos;re seeing here is , we &apos;ve selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient .
joshua prince-ramus : building a theater that remakes itself
i worked on this for some 14 years , and i think it helped me become a better teacher .
and the conclusion of that is that psychology and psychiatry , over the last 60 years , can actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable .
they were doing something much simpler .
so i &apos;m a social scientist by training , so why am i here today talking about smart materials ?
&quot; oh , yes , &quot; he said , &quot; perfectly appropriate place for him . &quot;
and , eventually , we became interested in emotions .
but the money ran out .
nt : i needed no models , drawings or experiments .
audience : yes .
and then we do two other very important things that kind of help fill in this feedback loop : we help people understand in a little more detail what these values are and what they might indicate .
and , yes , they were great philanthropists .
twelve years ago , i was in the street writing my name to say , &quot; i exist . &quot;
and you can see here , as this animates over , steven &apos;s actual data against the background of all other patients , against this information .
i thought this would be easy , but i emailed about 200 different people within a five-hour radius of where i lived , and i got one positive response that said that they could work with me .
and that the building itself is occupied in the lower portion , broken up by a series of courts , and it &apos;s five acres of uninterrupted , horizontal space for their administrative offices .
but he told me to believe and feel the wind in my face .
the meme went out there .
maybe they could extract carbon dioxide .
and corporations are very like religions in many ways , except they &apos;re right down at the bottom of the pyramid of needs .
go regional and go to urban food systems .
i had them right at hand .
so mundane sounds can be really interesting if you pay attention .
it made me question and curious : how could someone actually find joy in cleaning toilets for a living ?
there &apos;s a great deal of argument about whether we , as the great nation that we are , should be the policeman of the world , the world &apos;s constabulary , but there should be virtually no argument about whether we should be the world &apos;s healer .
thank you very much . thanks .
the other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important , and so naturally , people sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities .
so i went searching when i started in this game to convince myself that there was any degree of plausibility to this whole crazy story .
he said , &quot; is the robot real ? &quot;
so if you think we &apos;re starting to question and disrupt and interrogate what money means , then the ultimate extension of that is , is there a reason for the government to be in charge of money anymore ?
with scissors and paper , artist béatrice coron creates intricate worlds , cities and countries , heavens and hells . striding onstage in a glorious cape cut from tyvek , she describes her creative process and the way her stories develop from snips and slices .
when my partner , steve , and i first started dating , he told me this story about penguins .
and if africa is going to get fixed , it &apos;s by them , not by us .
and you can see an image produced by this consortium .
but that &apos;s just the beginning .
unaids tell us that the hiv rate in zambia is 20 percent , and mortality estimates suggest it &apos;s only about 5 percent .
here &apos;s how apple actually communicates .
put your book beneath it and you can read .
unfortunately , empirical data , good , hard stats , don &apos;t exist , and therefore to prove my point , i first of all had to find some proxy way of uncovering how much food was being wasted .
if you stop that behavior on one group that you &apos;re experimenting with , and you allow it in another group that you &apos;re experimenting with , and then you present those rats with a cat odor-saturated collar , they &apos;re hardwired to flee and hide .
we &apos;re threatened by the greatest weapon ever , and knowing a good thing when it sees it , the air force decides it needs the biggest computer ever to protect us .
and the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the end of the summer when they have built the farmers &apos; market and it &apos;s open to the public -- that &apos;s the final exam .
this is boston dynamics &apos; &quot; bigdog . &quot;
but with regard to consciousness , people seem to think , each of us seems to think , &quot; i am an expert .

this is actually one of the rangers .
i still paint . i love art .
i was at a crossroads .
but with the robot , you can .
i travelled for a month in nepal with our good friend , matthieu ricard , and you &apos;ll remember matthieu famously said to all of us here once at ted , &quot; western science is a major response to minor needs . &quot;
for so many years we have fed on aid .
but before it &apos;s brought into use during copulation it has to become rigid , it has to become difficult to bend .
it was one of the most astonishing family dynamics i have ever seen .
openness . it &apos;s a word that denotes opportunity and possibilities .
precise measurements by grace , the gravity satellite , reveal that both greenland and antarctica are now losing mass , several hundred cubic kilometers per year .
how did you go food shopping ? you went with your neighbor , what a great social time .
so , i &apos;m going to finish with one last project , and this is a little bit more of adult play .
i add new images because i learn more about it every time i give it .
no , i think that &apos;s wrong .
immediate detection , immediate response .
i met a father the other day ; he looked a little crazed .
the trickster has a mind that is prepared for the unprepared .
most people are entirely unconscious of these filters .
why do we respond so much to our knowledge of where something comes from ?
the eye is still transparent and you can get light in .
and i also photographed the gift bag they gave me when i left .
and so i got interested in electronics , and you know , i studied to get my ham license . i was wiring up stuff .
it was mairead &apos;s sister .
but it &apos;s extremely difficult to move oil absorbent against the winds , the surface currents and the waves .
you still are on a piece of ice , you can still have sunlight and you can still survive while you &apos;re traveling from one place to another .
in my case , my left hand has a significant tremor and my left leg also .
they often lead to the acceleration of much-needed reforms .
and for those of you who prefer miles per hour , that &apos;s over 45 miles per hour in water . and this is really darn fast .
all right . now you can see that changes the light that &apos;s coming through there . right ?
now , a completely different thought .
now sometimes neuroscientists need to identify individual molecular components of neurons , molecules , rather than the entire cell .
again , gathering together farmers , gathering together stakeholders in east africa to get standards for organic produce . better prices .
somehow i ended up at the hospital .
and we can be doing it if we could just get over the fact that this little slice of things is going to be for free .
also , people were taking photographs of this , so it was being texted around the world extremely quickly , all this imagery .
it &apos;s a great pleasure to be here .
really scramble them up this time , please .
these are live bullets .
and another engineer thought , &quot; well , that would be a really good thing to use &quot; and ended up using it as a really nice trigger .
since 2001 , we &apos;ve interviewed hundreds of thousands of people -- young and old , men and women , educated and illiterate .
this is , once again , 1960 -- 50 years ago .
the pharmaceutical industry needs to place assets in a commons . they need to start sharing precompetitive research .

i could barely breathe . i was gasping for air .
there &apos;s not enough room for the two of them .
three : the secret to high performance isn &apos;t rewards and punishments , but that unseen intrinsic drive -- the drive to do things for their own sake .
and what &apos;s important about that is that , on our planet , on earth , wherever we find liquid water , we find life .
when i go out to direct a film , every day we prepare too much , we think too much .
so that was one of those cases where you let the wings go , right ?
if you thought , three percent of the population likes classical music , if only we could move it to four percent . how would you walk ?
people stink !
what does technology do to deception with those folks ?
mobility on demand is something we &apos;ve been thinking about , so we think we need an ecosystem of these shared-use vehicles connected to mass transit .
you &apos;ve figured out an unknown location of a satellite orbiting the planet from a known location on the ground .
but also , we &apos;re finding from freedom house in a study that they published last year that freedom has been on the decline every year for the past seven years .

and he was dealing with diverse and dynamic markets .
that we could create a classification of the mental illnesses .
this is especially important for extroverted children too .
so , this one mushroom , in particular , has drawn our interest over time .
and those young people become older people .
and i want to pause here for -- i want to pause here for a second , because there &apos;s a couple of interesting things .
the military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplane was the sr71 . it went a whole life cycle , got too rusty to fly , and was taken out of service . the concorde doubled the speed for airline travel .
natasha told me that a lot of the kids thought she was stuck up , because they would talk to her and she wouldn &apos;t answer , and they didn &apos;t realize she didn &apos;t actually speak english very well , in the beginning .
that &apos;s our next big challenge .
and she reminded me that my favorite color was blue .
it &apos;s the direct signal being recorded from my head , rendered in real time .
when you become fluent with reading and writing , it &apos;s not something that you &apos;re doing just to become a professional writer .
now polls show that men tell twice as many lies as women -- assuming the women they ask told the truth .
it took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem .
and in classical music we can follow these changes very , very accurately because of the music &apos;s powerful silent partner , the way it &apos;s been passed on : notation .
and when we color-code this image , to bring out the faint light levels , we see that these jets feed a plume that , in fact , we see , in other images , goes thousands of miles into the space above enceladus .
i &apos;ve been all around the world , and there will be a thousand kids crying out your name , and it &apos;s such a weird , visceral experience .
and i know this footage isn &apos;t going to look like anything to you -- we had a crummy camera at the time -- but i was ecstatic .
after fixing , breaking , redesigning , mending , bending and amending , my ideal bow began to take shape , and when it was finally done , it looked like this .
he says , &quot; how many zeros in a trillion ? i &apos;ve got to calculate that right away . &quot;
now around chernobyl , there are scattered ghost villages , eerily silent , strangely charming , bucolic , totally contaminated .
or they can transfer control to someone in india or china who can take over for a while , because it &apos;s all going to be directly connected through the internet .
and we might think of these as abandoned .
evelyn glennie : well then , stop clapping . try again .
we can &apos;t hatch plans and climb that stairway of popularity , of success .
now , my brother and i had never heard anything like that in our whole lives . it was so beautiful .
and i don &apos;t have to do anything .
so , what &apos;s significant about this to me isn &apos;t that we can train crows to pick up peanuts .
it has 2,000 life cycles these days .
and i &apos;m going to kick it to keith to explain why that &apos;s important from a technical standpoint .
there are a handful that have escaped into the mainstream , the ones i &apos;ve just shown you , but every day , every month , people are producing thousands of these .
charles darwin and i and you broke off from the family tree from chimpanzees about five million years ago .
now why , steve , why do we need a revolution ?
just because people can &apos;t see us doesn &apos;t mean we &apos;re going to necessarily lie .
now as it turns out -- thank you .
i have a couple of ideas to begin with .
sayyid qutb is one of the founding fathers of fanatical islam , one of the ideologues that inspired osama bin laden .
it turns out that regular play-doh that you buy at the store conducts electricity , and high school physics teachers have used that for years .
to create is to make something that has never existed before .
the way i want to do this is to build a facility where i can study this .
what a 404 page tells you is that you fell through the cracks .
if you look at this building in chile , it &apos;s ripped in half , but it &apos;s not a pile of rubble .
but there &apos;s no way to learn to fly like a hummingbird unless you fly .
but i still think that this -- -- may be this year &apos;s version of this .
so i thought of a different way by thinking , well , the talks revolve around certain themes .
five to seven percent only are inspected -- five to seven percent .
he came up to me and said , &quot; thank you for starting movember . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know what the rules were , i &apos;m a natural born scientist , i guess , or some kind of a throwback to the 17th century , whatever .
we have art students getting together , taking old radiator parts and doing an iron-pour to make something new out of it .
now everybody agrees that thyroid cancers are sky high , and that chernobyl evacuees suffer the trauma of relocated peoples everywhere : higher levels of anxiety , depression , alcoholism , unemployment and , importantly , disrupted social networks .
we have secularized badly , i would argue .
it &apos;s nation-based , while the threat is international .
there is something very restorative about nature , and it &apos;s part of how we are tuned .
there &apos;s a poem written by a very famous english poet at the end of the 19th century .
and you know what ? if we can &apos;t do that , if we can &apos;t use our intellectual power to end slavery , there is one last question : are we truly free ?
ao : what did you do with it , derek ?
when i was a child , i started to explore motion .
the corruption in the state administration of countries like albania -- it &apos;s not up to me to say also like greece -- can be fought only by modernization .
i suppose that will take me to my last piece -- what cinema means for me .
we want to develop these little tiny capsules about the size of a piece of risotto that we can put into the muscles and telemeter out the emg signals , so that it &apos;s not worrying about electrode contact .
they talked about feeling stronger and braver .
maybe you ought to buy efficiency at 26 bucks instead of 12 .
and now who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip -- not about you -- was spreading through the network ?
that &apos;s the reason i &apos;m using this podium and using these notes .
sierra leone down there . mauritius is up there . mauritius was the first country to get away with trade barriers , and they could sell their sugar -- they could sell their textiles -- on equal terms as the people in europe and north america .
like yourself , i &apos;m a complex amalgam of positive and negative personality traits that emerge or not , depending on the circumstances . &quot;
so i began drawing the story that was moving in my head .
can you even imagine what that looks like ?
instead of a weapon , just this shepherd &apos;s staff , and he says -- he &apos;s insulted -- &quot; am i a dog that you would come to me with sticks ? &quot;
when i got out i had a choice .
and i don &apos;t speak korean , but i &apos;m hearing these voices , and i &apos;m not hearing anger , i &apos;m hearing terror .
and i said , &quot; hang on , that is an amazing mustache . &quot;
he &apos;s probably remembering where his car was in terms of the distances and directions to extended buildings and boundaries around the location where he parked .
it was obvious to me to do another work .
you turn up the volume just a little bit -- i &apos;m talking about a little over 80 decibels -- and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate .
i really believe that we still have a lot to learn about the normal structure and function of our bodies .
yeah . and i think he looks now less miserable .
that &apos;s a lot .
it &apos;s an accurate representation , and it &apos;s pretty much at the correct speed for what is occurring inside you .
a normal investment bank is not a deposit bank , it &apos;s an investment bank ; it has 15 to 20 times .
it &apos;s some strange woman pretending to be my mother . &quot;
so there is no life possible at that type of mutation rate .
it &apos;s fallen by half .
but daylighting our creeks really improves their water quality and contributions to habitat .
you &apos;d be able to open portions in order to change the procession , allow people to come in and out for an intermission , or to enter for the beginning or the end of a performance .
unless , of course , if you have a ski lift .
but architecture is not the language of words .
dolphins aren &apos;t the only animals , the only non-human animals , to show mirror self-recognition .
and i said , just arrange these , from what &apos;s important to you and what &apos;s not , and then tell me why .
so updates from a beaver .
so there &apos;s no more signal for us to tell us to stop .
air quality is an obvious thing to anyone who breathes .
my brother is kind of busy .
and my son , youngest son who studied in beijing , in china , he got a long-term perspective .
so this is the system that i &apos;m talking about , off the west coast . it &apos;s coincident with the tectonic plate , the juan de fuca tectonic plate .
these are just for information : hypertension , diabetes , obesity , lack of exercise . the usual suspects .
number three -- isn &apos;t this stuff cool ?
our objective is to be a millennium city , just like many millennium cities around : istanbul , rome , london , paris , damascus , cairo .
this picture was taken last year .
and if one were to eclipse the milky way , this is what it would look like .
throughout human history people have played games .
and you put a little fan here .
well , first of all , let me thank emeka -- as a matter of fact , ted global -- for putting this conference together .
anyway , in this same kind of approach , i designed k.
day one , day two , day three , day four , day five , day six .
we have the magic porridge pot in the form of walmart and tesco .
well , it was the whole city .
there is a problem with vaccines around the world not getting to patients . and the reason is that the refrigeration somehow gets broken ; what &apos;s called the &quot; cold chain &quot; gets broken .
now brunel may have asked a question like this , &quot; how do i take a train from london to new york ? &quot;
it &apos;s axiomatic . why not us ?
the vast grasslands of patagonia are turning to desert as you see here .
apple undoubtedly brings this innovation to us early , but its time was approaching because its core technology had been evolving for decades .
nathaniel kahn : scenes from &quot; my architect &quot;
there &apos;s 21,000 employees . this one factory -- and they had several of them -- is half a kilometer long .
but in the long run , if there &apos;s no life there , we create it ourselves .
so , our call to action -- my call to you -- is for you to make going green your next big thing , your gig .
and over the ensuing few years , there were great sagas about designing biosphere 2 .
augmented reality is just the latest technology .
this effect is so robust that we find it no matter how we ask the question .
so we started to change genes at random , looking for long-lived animals .
talk to people in restaurants .
when did that last happen ?
and it turns out that a sound like this is the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their call across the fields and savannahs .
they looked outside , and then they changed what was on the inside .
we went in underneath and tapped it , and we found that it had the ph of drano .
here is a graph that he put together showing the percentage of male deaths due to warfare in a number of foraging , or hunting and gathering societies .
and it gets worse , i crashed it into your house .
so i remember getting my american passport .
nina tandon : caring for engineered tissue
so i am one of those people with a transformative personal story .
rb : no . i suppose if you &apos;re having problems getting a booking in a restaurant or something , that might be worth using it .
or , even better , let &apos;s just take people right out of the emergency room -- undefined , community-acquired respiratory tract infections .
as i slowly lost my speech , i gained my voice .
this whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point where i could say &quot; synecdochically &quot; to all of you .
and i think it &apos;s an idea worth spreading .
now , most school districts can &apos;t really afford organic food , but we , as a nation , have to start thinking about consuming , growing and feeding our children food that &apos;s not chock-full of chemicals .
it &apos;s china there , moving against better health there , improving there .
and if you &apos;ve lived in australia in the last 30 years , the final cause -- you will have heard always that indigenous people trash houses .
and i saw something extraordinary happening in silicon valley , so i wanted to be there , and i saw that the computer was coming into our homes , that it had to change in order to be with us in our homes .
they &apos;re things like this .
we have partners ; it &apos;s not hard to guess google would be one ; the others are all playing to pending .
they can unite . they can come together . if people would stop , lives will be saved . &quot;
but ... there is a vacancy for a ...
take for example this email i recieved from a firefighter here in california .
fifty years ago , such anomalies covered only two- to three-tenths of one percent of the land area .
but the main reason i did it is that that &apos;s what happens to me when i &apos;m forced to wear a lady gaga skanky mic .
torsten reil talks about how the study of biology can help make natural-looking animated people -- by building a human from the inside out , with bones , muscles and a nervous system . he spoke at in 2003 ; see his work now in gta4 .
for two reasons , i think .
this is a dolphin that is self-aware .
i &apos;ve had the privilege of living by a meadow for the last little while , and it is terribly engaging .
brazil &apos;s northeast state of pernambuco is one of the nation &apos;s most violent regions .
but it got violent in the last two decades and includes decapitation and the death of two mayors .
well , we know that they can roll balls in a straight line using celestial cues .
but they failed , almost completely , to make any .
the first kind tells you , &quot; you can do it ! you can make it ! anything is possible ! &quot;
this is a big question now to help us understand why they should be in the city .
we call this antiangiogenic therapy , and it &apos;s completely different from chemotherapy because it selectively aims at the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers .
this is just an example of one of these computable documents .
it wasn &apos;t like a telephone system where you had control of a line : you had to share packets .
they go from eight cents a mile in 2010 , to four cents a mile in 2015 , to two cents a mile by 2020 .
we don &apos;t want to lose pulling power , nor direction .
when i listened to all the stories everywhere i went on the continents , i couldn &apos;t always understand the complicated circumstances of their conflict .
as you might see the bottom of the list was climate change .
we have some cameras on the south edge of the ilulissat , watching the calving face as it goes through this dramatic retreat .
there &apos;s an impact , it &apos;s cumulative .
it &apos;s a natural process . it goes on in nature today , and the bacteria die as soon as we stop feeding them .
solar flares are enormous magnetic outbursts from the sun that bombard the earth with high-speed subatomic particles .
ok , designers , please put up your hands , even though i can &apos;t even see you .
zk : i &apos;d just like to let you all know that this presentation has been brought to you by target .
i wrote about maricela guzman , the daughter of mexican immigrants , who joined the military so she could afford college .
thank you . thank you . thank you .
and i testified to that inquiry in secret .
now , what are we doing with all this information ?
and in particular , i think we can learn things about learning .
and i think that one of the happiest things is the sense that with my children i &apos;ve been able to introduce them into the very small circle of humans who are lucky enough , or possibly stupid enough , to still climb trees .
no , this ritual was about the one message that physicians have needed to convey to their patients .
what is the imagery of god ?
ninety degrees north -- that is slap bang in the north pole .
yes , it means i didn &apos;t have to draw gyeonghoeru .

he worked with john wayne and most of those old punch-ups you see in the westerns . yakima was either there or he stunt coordinated .
and they sort of fly away , out of your head .
and they invented , what ? gavage .
despite the fact that each and every one of these disorders originates in the brain , most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis of observable behavior .
living in your genome is the history of our species , and you as an individual human being , where you &apos;re from , going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years , and that &apos;s now starting to be understood .
but when he &apos;s in the arena , at best he wins , and at worst he loses , but when he fails , when he loses , he does so daring greatly . &quot;
secondly , to create even more intensive and strict public demand to reduction of chemicals in the agricultural fresh produce .
&quot; but why ? &quot; i asked him .
so the good news is that earlier this year , the state council passed a new regulation on house requisition and demolition and passed the right to order forced demolition from local governments to the court .
and let me show you something else .
fabian oefner : psychedelic science
we &apos;re actually teaching him .
andy hobsbawm : we &apos;ve got the science , we &apos;ve had the debate .
i work with a species called &quot; bonobo . &quot;
so i was so moved by this -- this is incredible . this was connecting , right .
bush &apos;s bigotry was not an isolated mistake , blurted out in the heat of the moment and later retracted .
you can &apos;t do science without proposing hypotheses .
the ones on the left are from africa , from around a million years ago .
and then i thought -- in my 40s i started thinking , &quot; well , why don &apos;t i do something ?
are we born to be optimistic , rather than realistic ? tali sharot shares new research that suggests our brains are wired to look on the bright side -- and how that can be both dangerous and beneficial .
or if they do have our interests at heart , we worry that they don &apos;t know us well enough to figure out what they need to do in order to allow us to secure those interests .
and as you see on this animation , what kepler is going to detect is just the dimming of the light from the star .
now imagine -- let &apos;s put the ship noise in the picture .
and i said , &quot; yeah , it happens by itself . &quot; &quot; how did you know that ? &quot;
but that spring , there were new buds popping up from the earth .

not the last . yes , that &apos;s difficult to find a card here .
it happens to one in three , and it happened to me .
some of these oftentimes have problems with reading .

you &apos;ll notice that , for the first four centuries , there &apos;s hardly any growth at all , just 0.2 percent .
so you have things like resemblance , where something which resembles the physical world can be abstracted in a couple of different directions : abstracted from resemblance , but still retaining the complete meaning , or abstracted away from both resemblance and meaning towards the picture plan .
we use these every day .
that was my mantra .
but i particularly am really excited about using this technology in online worlds , like there , for example , that tom melcher has shown us .
we have focused on the problems .
the dots exhibit human qualities . they kind of have their own physics , and they swarm wildly around , kind of exploring the world of life .
all right , now what we &apos;re just feeling there is plus-one emotional resilience , which means you have the ability to provoke powerful , positive emotions like curiosity or love , which we feel when we look at baby animals , when you need them most .

that is absolutely remarkable , and that is a central feature of what i &apos;m trying to say today .
we &apos;re just waiting for someone to lead us . &quot;
so i personally think that our life expectancy for tamiflu as an effective drug is very limited -- very limited indeed .

and i suppose that that &apos;s true with thousands of people .
they wear bright colors , rose and blue , like eastern dress . &quot;
but we need to think broad-scale . we need to think globally .
i &apos;m trying to travel there to find 5,000 year-old moss , which lives on the antarctic peninsula .
okay , number one is , we must teach physicians about the value of geographical information .
so this is what i really think .
how do you try to get a handle on extraterrestrial life ?
i &apos;m not one of the people zoning out with headphones or a book .
is that an animal carcass behind her ? &quot;

what we need are people who see the value in investing in these types of local enterprises , who will partner with folks like me to identify the growth trends and climate adaptation as well as understand the growing social costs of business as usual .
so , they started giving me the statistics on how many of these kids had lost an arm .
now , places that didn &apos;t do this -- new york city for example , moscow , jakarta -- we &apos;re talking , at its peak , one in two injectors infected with this fatal disease .
as we spread out around the world , we developed thousands of different languages .
and they also do not properly account for civilian suffering more generally .
they serviced the loans .
or something like this , which is the lighting design he did for general motors , for the car showroom .

and as i rotate it against this side shot , you &apos;ll see that that has cylinder , and that was programmed in -- literally into the physics of the system .
and that &apos;s to take isaac mizrahi &apos;s advice and confront the manipulation of it all , and sort of admit that manipulation is something that we enjoy , but also enjoy how it happens .

this yoyo right here cost 112 dollars , but it sleeps for 12 minutes .
what does a human brain have or do that no other brain does ?

we would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with -- of course , in the long run , also to deal with global warming .

i &apos;d like to share with you a story about how i &apos;ve experienced this very dramatically in my own work .

so we &apos;re 35 years behind .
it &apos;s about a meter tall pavona clavus colony .

you will go to a her2 amplified clinic , or an egfr activated clinic , and they will go to some of the pathogenic lesions that were involved in causing this individual cancer .
i &apos;m looking for a husband . right ?

but this teaches us a new respect -- and it &apos;s a new respect not only for the chimpanzees , i suggest , but some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet .

and what would a child -- what does a child like jamie -- the young boy -- think , i mean , with all this anger that &apos;s built up inside of him ?

it is this underlying assumption of limitlessness that makes it possible to take the reckless risks that we do .
if a soldier sees his friend blown up , his brain goes into such high alarm that he can &apos;t actually put the experience into words , so he just feels the horror over and over again .

we &apos;re doing 15-minute exams with patients .
it doesn &apos;t matter if you fail .

the military council has cracked down on civil society and protests and the country &apos;s economy continues to suffer .
we &apos;re measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day , particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums .
vodka , gin -- yes . yes . you know your mice well .

so i said , have what , shall i translate the internet into some indian language ? that &apos;s not possible .
i just have a feeling this kid &apos;s been there for a week , you know .
and the wonderful thing is that superstring theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions , but when we study superstring theory , we find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling , new form .
and that &apos;s dopamine-fed . and that &apos;s , &quot; i must have this one person . &quot;
and i just feel , at last , one with the stick and one with the drum .
and since we &apos;ve already had so many problems with police use of non-lethal weapons in various ways , i thought it would be a really good idea to look at some of those things and try to relate it to the military context .
being a journalist , after terence died , i wrote a book , &quot; the cost of hope . &quot;
they &apos;re very low to the water , and they &apos;re all uninhabited , except one island has about 35 caretakers on it .
so here i had this falcon , and it was lovely . it looked really great , the light worked on it really well , it was better than anything that i could achieve or obtain out in the world .
it had &apos; chad &apos; written in magic marker on it .
when i see objects , i imagine them in motion .
but on that mountain where we gain that beautiful peace of mind , what are we really achieving ?
all of industry was in play , as investors flocked to place their bets .
they &apos;ll pop it back on and fix the scratch later .
i hope this worries you , by the way -- when you go to see your physician .
now , you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo .
and what &apos;s more , your wife has just run off with your best friend . &quot;
it &apos;s extremely inexpensive and rechargeable every five years .
we have to keep everything under control .
so there &apos;s another function on here .
we tried to do the same thing by negotiating industry-right deals with the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric and other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools .
they don &apos;t employ those workers .
and i &apos;m applying a similar trick to say , what if we looked at the universe in our culture through the eyes of technology ? what does technology want ?
vusi mahlasela : &quot; thula mama &quot;
and this booking is within all the parameters for each individual .
we actually drilled holes into the ice , way deep down below the thawing level , and had some cameras out there for the past month and a half or so .
so i think half of my book advance went into sunscreen .
and so they started following and watching petty thefts , summonses , all kinds of things -- charting the future essentially .
so now , look at inner conditions . aren &apos;t they stronger ?
no one is better at this activity of actually getting us to engage in delivering services , sometimes where none exist , than ushahidi .
there &apos;s a very short list of these places .
he was a master mechanic , and he taught me how to use tools .
it almost made me feel a little bit guilty about having an uplifting talk about the future .
but he said , &quot; we will partner with you , but we &apos;re not going to invest in it . you need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work . &quot;
in fact , you could be in a bottle with a cap on top , and you would not die at all , and you would not need any fresh air .
so , for example , they can say their work is available freely for non-commercial , this amateur-type of use , but not freely for any commercial use .
well i think back to my childhood , a good part of which i spent , after being born here in chicago , i spent in europe .
in the economic system in traditional africa , the means of production is privately owned .
almost like a ghost , isn &apos;t it , huh ?
we studied the winds and the sun to make sure everybody in the city will have fresh air , fresh water and direct sunlight in every single apartment at some point during the day .
what i then saw in this little moving blue dot was the potential for chaos .
it turned out it was quite clever because deep blue , in a company like bmw , has a hook -- &quot; deep blue , &quot; wow , cool name .
so a big disclaimer is put on everything that i do , and i made narratives about all the european or brit celebrities and comments about our public figures .
you know , you can tell -- and i think when we &apos;re getting into collective play , its really important for groups to gain a sense of safety through their own sharing of play signals .
but , as a cancer doc , this is what i see .
i then thought it would be years before we &apos;d be able to make it really , really useful .
marriage-manual author and semen-sniffer theodoor van de velde -- has a line in his book .
well , the evidence is , unfortunately , ample .
and this is the water feeler .
paul steinhardt , a physicist from new york , and aranda / lasch , architects , collaborated in an installation in london at the serpentine .
this little squid is called the fire shooter now it may look like a tasty morsel , or a pig &apos;s head with wings -- but if it &apos;s attacked , it puts out a barrage of light -- in fact , a barrage of photon torpedoes .
go a couple generations forward to where we are , though , and it looks like a completely different world .
and that brings me to another aspect of this , which is , to whom should this get paid ?
and since i don &apos;t like to travel alone , they also invited my daughter , son-in-law and granddaughter , so we had a lovely trip to see russia today , which is not a very pleasant and happy view .
bp obviously has a bit more on their mind now .
some abilities , of course , decrease with age .
but there &apos;s a fourth thing .
can we map that space , using the language of neutrinos or cosmic rays , taking the bounding condition of the body as its limit , but in complete reversal of , in a way , the most traditional greek idea of pointing ?
so the obvious thing for me to talk about today is graphics and audio .
to you and me , that &apos;s a heart attack .
and for three months out of the year , the surface temperatures go up to 150 to 180 .
this is a little company that &apos;s done very well with simplicity and elegance .
it means that i can take these two identical squares , and i can put them in light and dark surrounds .
it &apos;s sort of an alternative universe .
there &apos;s figs and everything else there for the taking .
i mean , we &apos;ve been doing it for two million years , so it &apos;s kind of arrogant to assume that i &apos;ve got something to say that hasn &apos;t been said and performed better a long time ago .
and you have huge differences within countries also .
we can &apos;t even afford to eat anything except beans .
there &apos;s lots of hormones . there &apos;s testosterone , adrenalin .
pick one : stand up and take three steps , or make your hands into fists , raise them over your head as high as you can for five seconds . go !
things wear out .
because there &apos;s another way of seeing it .
and that may not sound very intuitive , but let me flip over to something else you know about , and that &apos;s computers .
finally they were all arrested and taken to the drancy camp and they managed to get out at the last minute thanks to their argentinean papers .
so i went into the library to figure out how did this thing work .
i was very struck by natalie merchant &apos;s songs last night , recovering old poems .
and they &apos;ve all gone on to master &apos;s and ph.d. degrees in excellent places .
note , that when we went into libya , it was not good enough for the west to do it alone ; we had to bring others in .
it &apos;s a woman . you can see the hair .
yeah , it &apos;s a -- this one here , that &apos;s much better .
that will blow away a lot of the opposition .
i lost the fight , but probably won my life back .
i want to tell you about one family that i met , and why i think they offer clues .
because technically i &apos;ve got motors ; i &apos;ve got wheels -- i &apos;m a motor vehicle .
so , about three years ago i was in london , and somebody called howard burton came to me and said , i represent a group of people , and we want to start an institute in theoretical physics .
the service which grew out of this , dial 1298 for ambulance , with one ambulance in 2004 , now has a hundred-plus ambulances in three states , and has transported over 100,000 patients and victims since inception .
diluting it down to the point where there &apos;s none of it left .
we talked about inertia and organ donations and checking the box .
the steam engine , and the other associated technologies of the industrial revolution changed the world and influenced human history so much , that in the words of the historian ian morris , they made mockery out of all that had come before .
nine hours of feeding per day seems to be the practical limit for a primate .
that , by the way , in case you &apos;re paying attention , is not emotionally correct .
after one harvest , they had increased their income enough to buy a second system to do their full quarter-acre .
it &apos;s not interesting because it &apos;s so common .
two other things that i learned that were very surprising to me -- one was how casual we are about energy .
those pictures we use to analyze how much carbon , how the forest is developing , and we can monitor every tree using satellite images through our cooperation .
and how do we think about materials and structure , sort of as an information and computation problem ?
well it turns out that what happens is the negative data goes missing in action ; it &apos;s withheld from doctors and patients .
i &apos;ve been writing about food more or less omnivorously -- one might say indiscriminately -- for about 30 years .
and what you can see is that nearly all the spider draglines surpass them .
and people would come in and learn more about it .
this is sanghamitra .
when you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more likely to be big brother exerting more control , more secrecy , or us watching big brother , or it &apos;s just all to be played for either way ?
sousa was not a fan of the talking machines .
and since we all smell different and produce chemicals on our skin that either attract or repel mosquitos , some of us are just more attractive than others .
it &apos;s not just competitive , it &apos;s also caring .
&#91; unclear &#93; you just looked like you turned it on its end . but when you see it like that it &apos;s more interesting looking .
he actually coined the term homo sapiens -- it means wise man in latin .
my foot goes down its throat . it spits me out .
70 percent of the kids couldn &apos;t find afghanistan or iraq on a map ; 60 percent couldn &apos;t find india ; 30 percent couldn &apos;t find the pacific ocean .
it &apos;s pretty extraordinary .
and she is definitely on her way .
and they are brilliant ; it &apos;s wonderful work .
maybe i wasn &apos;t as smart , but i was at least as talkative .
this guy thought in the same way i did .
it was breathtaking .
youtube , they &apos;re putting this thing on youtube .
yes ? we heard that .
what happens when the economy recovers ?
and the reason that that &apos;s relevant is that very soon i will be walking into what we call a stage two tribe , which looks like this .
so one of the problems with these small robots is their payload carrying capacity .
and so we can send out sound waves , they bounce off objects like fish and are reflected back .
obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention .
i &apos;m going to show you a couple now .
so if humans evolved as runners , if that &apos;s our one natural advantage , why are we so bad at it ? why do we keep getting hurt ?
and what we need to do now is look at the whole pacific ocean in its entirety and make a network of mpas across the pacific so that we have our world &apos;s largest ocean protected and self-sustaining over time .
what is your ideal , and also , what has been edited out ?
if they want , they can call the granny cloud .
i should be able to ask my house where my shoes are .
maybe you &apos;ve had grand plans before but stopped yourself , thinking , &quot; that &apos;s impossible , &quot; or , &quot; that costs too much , &quot; or , &quot; that won &apos;t benefit me . &quot;
shamsul wares : it was almost impossible , building for a country like ours .
but what does this mean when we have no context for what it is that we &apos;re working on , and we &apos;re just doing these little labors ?
you know , they &apos;re a step in size from the entire observable universe .
it shows these women playing with these toys .
it &apos;s just too damn hard .
what experiments would you run ?
notice that the bottles here have caps on them .
but for the most part , we &apos;ve gone from salting to exhausting .
and that message , very frankly , is valuable for society today .
those cells turn themselves over once every eight years .
he found the foster parents , and he said to them , &quot; treat this as an adoption . he &apos;s yours forever .
and kids could bring in drawings and have the store print a sugar plate for the top of their birthday cake .
thank you .
and that &apos;s what we do to all traffic survivors .
i stay . if i go , i will be killed .
well , i was a grown man who had all of these rituals , and it got so there was a throbbing , there was a ferocious fear in my head .
this market is now estimated at over 800 million dollars annually .
now , one publisher , action publishing , was willing to take that leap and trust me and to listen to what i had to say .
well the swedish students protest at this point .
we want to roll out 15 aims centers in the next five years , all over africa .
let me just show you one thing .
you don &apos;t want to tell americans , god forbid , that they have to change their lifestyle .
and each time i get done with ooh , you may say i &apos;m a dreamer but i &apos;m not the only one 222 .
this was on a monkey hunt , hunting with curare-tipped darts .
of course , the milk can is his .
you are the reason why i said yes to the invitation to come here today .
ag : every scientist will recognize that expression of despair .
i &apos;ll explain it all later , just pay attention to the number at the bottom : plus-7.68245837 minutes that will be my gift to you if i &apos;m successful in my mission .
i think it &apos;s worth the trouble because , again , it just helps us to understand .
aging : the problem is enormous , 300,000 broken hips per year ; but the solutions are extraordinary , and they include so many different things .
assumption number one in the food industry used to be that the way to find out what people want to eat -- what will make people happy -- is to ask them .
what if we combined it with this ?
so it &apos;s actually a multi-dimensional user interface .
no matter how you do that , you &apos;re not going to start with a 100,000-dollar instrument and bring it down to no-cost . it isn &apos;t going to work .
and this is actually how a cancer goes from being harmless to deadly .
so you can &apos;t make it too simple .
what &apos;s great about this is , the tools to do this are free .
and stop where you want .
i like &quot; climate crisis &quot; instead of &quot; climate collapse , &quot; but again , those of you who are good at branding , i need your help on this .
he &apos;s already at war with the iranians , with the king of persia .
this is actually a spanish quarry , which sort of inspired the kind of spaces that these galleries could be .
for this to work , this progress must be sustainable .
i learned about ordinary people who could be heroes .
what if we had a very low commitment , but delivered something individually unique to each person who contributed ?
but things are also changing at a very rapid pace .
so they &apos;re simple building blocks .
&quot; connected &quot; is a collaboration with choreographer gideon obarzanek .
but mary went further .
the game was helping us experience what scientists call post-traumatic growth , which is not something we usually hear about .
and this is what it is .
we paid two to three times more than anybody else .
leslie byrne , a democrat from virginia , describes that when she went to congress , she was told by a colleague , &quot; always lean to the green . &quot;
even though , quite frankly , some of your presentations are horrifying , absolutely horrifying .
in a recent study , the evidence has shown that income is the greatest determinant of how long a democracy can last .
let me give you the example .
when i was sleeping , with a tripod and a timer .
we &apos;re getting tired of it . it &apos;s kind of cliched now .
so what &apos;s going on ?
and as you get to the very bottom , you &apos;re faced with the unfortunate reality that if you don &apos;t save anything for retirement , you won &apos;t be able to afford any housing at all .
and that turns into the title of my first book , &quot; inversions . &quot;
and if you think this is absurd , it &apos;s not .
there are kunskapsskolan schools in sweden .
you add all this up together and of course people are apathetic .
and i think this applies across a very broad -- sort of , a lot of concepts .
that &apos;s me , getting a nasal lavage .
nathaniel kahn shares clips from his documentary &quot; my architect , &quot; about his quest to understand his father , the legendary architect louis kahn . it &apos;s a film with meaning to anyone who seeks to understand the relationship between art and love .
this is the subjective height -- the height you saw of these guys at various points .
and i was just like , &quot; yeah , i guess i am .
and this hallucinatory drawing shows you -- everything you see in this drawing is iluvatar .
from over 12,000 civilians deliberately killed in civil wars in 1997 and 1998 , a decade later , this figure stands at 4,000 .
there &apos;s somebody hiding behind there pulling the strings , whether it &apos;s the illuminati or the bilderbergers .
ladies and gentlemen , i made a different choice .
invest sustainably . majora mentioned this .
and whether you become happy or not depends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch .
this is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity in the global phase of sustainability .
so , at 2.3 billion dollars before the first ball was bowled .
time after time , whenever i set out to share some great truth with a soon-to-be grateful recipient , it had the opposite effect .
but experimental science had been tied up with all those things .
it has an urge , and technology has an urge .
and there , for the first time , i encountered the other religious traditions : judaism and islam , the sister religions of christianity .
it &apos;s not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women .
so , we really will continue to focus on products .
this is more than 10,000 feet higher than the previous world &apos;s altitude record held by the sr-71 blackbird .
anybody who &apos;s over 15 doesn &apos;t know what this means , because in the last 10 years , the number of elementary school classroom teachers has been cut in half .
they first taught us about ecology in the context of natural resources .
in mexico , nike has run a campaign recently called , literally , bid your sweat .
so let me end with just a few words about applications that we &apos;ve found for this .
out of this rubble of haiti and from this devastation came something that we call tera -- the trilogy emergency response application -- which has been used to support the aid effort ever since .
he took apart the archimedes manuscript and the other seven manuscripts .
it &apos;s become this intense industrialized zone .
but in reality , it is managed by and for those who have the resources to go out and exploit it .
so i had 50 overall summaries done .
and it turns out there &apos;s one way .
there was a very important study done a while ago at princeton theological seminary that speaks to why it is that when all of us have so many opportunities to help , we do sometimes , and we don &apos;t other times .
and i of course knew stuff , as a designer , about typography , even though we worked with those animals not so successfully .
what this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating .
and by the way , we should point out that this was not a big meaning .
so that &apos;s all that happens .
so , you &apos;re calling for a global ethic .
we shopped double coupons and layaway and consignment stores , and when she got sick with stage four breast cancer and could no longer work , we even applied for food stamps .
but unless you learn how to mix hard power with soft power into strategies that i call smart power , you &apos;re not going to deal with the new kinds of problems that we &apos;re facing .
in the stomach , the eggs went on to develop into tadpoles , and in the stomach , the tadpoles went on to develop into frogs , and they grew in the stomach until eventually the poor old frog was at risk of bursting apart .
you &apos;re just one of the people who hasn &apos;t been told .
and that &apos;s the end .
and those post-it notes involve this and other proteins of its class -- so-called bromodomains .
one of the burning questions , of course , is if we go there and find life in the sub-surface , as i fully expect that we will , is that a second genesis of life ?
it has nothing to do with the fact that i was born there , of course .
and i thought it might serve as a kind of permanent mnemonic device .
probably , it &apos;s a combination of this .
and as these dark clouds were circling me , and i was finding it really , really difficult to think of anything good , i said to myself that i really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow .
i called my friends , painted on their bodies , and had them dance in front of a painting .
and we see these gravitational lensing effects , these distortions that say that , again , clusters are embedded in dark matter .
and the third thing : it &apos;s a symbol of his influence .
but this phenomenal project &apos;s been happening .
so i start with the ace -- yeah , ace . ah , yeah -- spades ?
so in origami , to obey these laws , we can take simple patterns -- like this repeating pattern of folds , called textures -- and by itself it &apos;s nothing .
that became , as it were , a way of confronting large businesses in the business of wasting food , and exposing , most importantly , to the public , that when we &apos;re talking about food being thrown away , stuff that &apos;s beyond the pale .
it &apos;s the achingly sentimental yearning for times that never happened .
or we can use cells alone , either your very own cells or different stem cell populations .
now , the fundamental basis of neoclassical economics would tell you it &apos;s irrational to reject a dollar because someone you don &apos;t know in another room is going to get 99 .
i do speak to sex workers , 15,000 of them for this particular slide , and this is what sex workers say they earn in an hour .
and so , in 2004 , they commissioned us to do a screen test of benjamin .
as designers , we need to be able to transition in and out of play also .
now we actually have been doing it for a long time .
and one afternoon , i got a call from my doctor .
now , we know that that &apos;s wrong .
you have to go to the literature and look up what &apos;s known about feet .
this is benki .
who is going to raise their hand and say , &quot; i want to hear what you &apos;re doing next , &quot; and sell something to them .
i mean this quite seriously .
the biggest challenge is that material science is complex and requires expensive equipment .
so encouraging people to actually go online and share information and data on blogs and wikis is great because otherwise , low level apparatchiks and bureaucrats will continue concealing what &apos;s actually happening in the country , right ?
and that means the complete cycle of coming from inside , out to the physical , to someone perceiving it .
much later , robert maillart &apos;s bridges , which optimize structural form with a calculus curvature almost like a parabola .
when you multiply that by all the nurses in all the wards in 40 hospitals in the system , it resulted , actually , in a pretty big impact .
what we &apos;re told in terms of arguments against leaving this country is that the fate of the women is primary .
then there are other things that don &apos;t cost much and achieve absolutely nothing .
so they had created these artifacts .
i made a promise to her grandmother , your mother , that i would find a family , and now i &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re going to take care of her . &quot;
so i believe that we have an ethic that the earth grows our food , and we need to move to an ethic in this century that the earth should grow our homes .
as you know , it &apos;s not going to turn out well .
i almost couldn &apos;t finish it .
you &apos;ll notice , of course , that there are hot spots -- south asia , africa .
will eventually joined a gang and committed a number of very serious crimes , including , most seriously of all , a horrible , tragic murder .
and i had an armored organization at that point .
this is an area thought to be involved in expressive communication .
my family &apos;s living in the hilton hotel in scotts valley .
so let me go on the next short video .
but it doesn &apos;t count the health of our children or the integrity of our public officials .
but the pleasure and the passion and the joy is still there .
beautiful , because it has symmetry .
and i described to them some of these lego experiments , and they said they felt like they had just been through that experiment .
they were saying , &quot; this is explicitly intended to give police an option between shouting and shooting .
he said , &quot; well , you just bend time and space , it takes an awful lot of energy , and that &apos;s just how you do it . &quot;
and you know some of them would probably be terrible chairs .
some pundit with too much time on his hands has reckoned that the new experiments are approximately 100 trillion times better than they were in 1960 , 100 trillion times better .
we spend 100 billion dollars a year on diet aids .
it &apos;s usually some kind of choice between the vocational and the intellectual .
every day , all of us here , we &apos;re building gods that have gone rampant , and it &apos;s time we started knocking them down and forgetting their names .
they tell us to have a bath .
let me just ask you one question first .
and i think this is beginning to happen in the entertainment business .
basically , a human body is a conversation going on , both within the cells and between the cells , and they &apos;re telling each other to grow and to die , and when you &apos;re sick , something &apos;s gone wrong with that conversation .
the global economic financial crisis has reignited public interest in something that &apos;s actually one of the oldest questions in economics , dating back to at least before adam smith .
and it was a funny kind of sick feeling , but i turned him down .
because architecture is also the asking of questions .
and this is what we spend a lot of our time doing , is just making sure that we can keep up with this kind of traffic load .
and i &apos;m really excited about this , because it &apos;s a very compact core .
but well done , him .
so just to take some quick examples : people text or do email during corporate board meetings .
if we look at the data , we can see that the answer to that question is , mmm .
and that will happen , paradoxically -- everything you hear about global warming -- when we hit co2 down to 10 parts per million , we are no longer going to have to have plants that are allowed to have any photosynthesis , and there go animals .
so , completely irrational , you would think .
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been building the suburbs with a lot of unintended consequences .
charles hazlewood : trusting the ensemble
he was saving lives with this machine .
so this is the story of bread as we know it now .
so i can determine , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re excited or whether you &apos;re aroused , or not , ok ?
eventually , it will be able to have to stay up day , night , day , night , for six months at a time , acting like the synchronous satellite , but only ten miles above the earth .
this becomes an isosceles triangle -- again , very shaky .
and four years later , as i said , it &apos;s been seen by four ...
so i feel that we have a bio-ethical imperative .
right ? so this is the first example .
the illiteracy rate in china among this generation is under one percent .
i think that means doodling is native to us and we simply are denying ourselves that instinct .
actually , the idea came out of an argument that i had at starbucks , that i insisted that i wasn &apos;t having colombian coffee ; the coffee was actually pre-columbian .
his counterpart is not college-educated and works as a laborer , works as a clerk , does low-level white collar or blue collar work in the economy .
can you imagine your world without it ?
so three questions i &apos;d offer you .
there are common elements of this that you &apos;ll see throughout chicago , and then there are your big-d design statements : the pritzker pavilion done by frank gehry .
now this is a tactic that patent trolls are supposed to use on people to get their way .
but when it &apos;s moving back and forth , the retina picks up these changes .
so that christmas -- maybe i &apos;ve got time for this -- that christmas i got the mister wizard fun-o-rama chemistry set .
we have to understand why people are not saving , and then we can hopefully flip the behavioral challenges into behavioral solutions , and then see how powerful it might be .
if you look at the last 35 years and different social transitions from dictatorship to democracy , you will see that out of 67 different cases , in 50 of these cases it was nonviolent struggle which was the key power .
because the more things that are familiar , the more things my hands know how to do , the more things that i can be happy and busy doing when my brain &apos;s not running the show anymore .
this is an un-retouched -- this is not a joke -- un-retouched photo of microsoft word , the copy that you have , with all the toolbars open .
but these clinics have treated tens of thousands of patients to date , many of them children , and spect imaging involves a radioactive injection , so exposing people to radiation , potentially harmful .
what is the exact relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and planetary temperatures ?
as far as we know , evidence to discover the most fundamental truths of all the sciences is here just for the taking on our planet .
but you don &apos;t want to get all of the insects .
it &apos;s our prejudgment that it &apos;s underground .
we have to turn that around .
and so you see this whole society getting frustrated about losing some of its mobility .
was to adopt a very classical model of fear .
you can see from the slide , very very strong .
every day , 24 hours , that pump is at your side , administering medicine directly to your heart , and it &apos;s not a particularly preferable medicine in many senses .
the earliest cell phones , the earliest personal computers were invented in the 1970s .
marvin minsky : health and the human mind
and this is where it gets really interesting , because it &apos;s not that simple , because we are not simple .
all the grayed-out species disappear .
you can also see the evolution of the one-child-only policy as it travels through the bloodline .
and so education needs to work by pull , not push .
they wished they &apos;d not packed rice .
i &apos;ve spent most of my professional life researching media and entertainment and its impact on people &apos;s lives .
and i &apos;m making the size of the bubble proportional to the amount of money that countries spent on students .
that &apos;s what all religions tell us : &quot; get on you knees and repeat it 10 or 20 or 15 times a day . &quot;
and we summarize them this way : the institutes have got to be relevant , innovative , cost-effective and high quality . why ?
he was never right again .

the fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage .
the majority of the planet , aspiring for development , having the right for development , are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle , a momentous pressure .

when i arrive -- and i take one minute , i am not so intelligent -- when i arrive at the level of animal species , that becomes real interesting .
so thank you , leonard cohen , for saving my life .
but you &apos;ve managed to talk yourself into that .
we &apos;ve slightly lost the habit of doing that , which is , i think , why we &apos;re particularly drawn to nature .
but part way through , they ran out .
it has gone in your stomach . it was not meant for that .
there &apos;s three particular things that i &apos;ve done , and i &apos;ll just describe those first , and then talk about some of my work .
product designer eben bayer reveals his recipe for a new , fungus-based packaging material that protects fragile stuff like furniture , plasma screens -- and the environment .
so that &apos;s sort of the theme : big , different and gone .
like i said , i just had a phone number that connected me to them .
you break things down into these calibrated slices that people can choose and do in parallel to keep them engaged and that you can use to point them towards individually beneficial activities .
in 1993 they declared the end of the armed struggle .
and then i looked at her and i said something that at the time felt a little dramatic , but ended up being more prophetic than dramatic .

and they &apos;ll never understand that she &apos;s raising two kids whose definition of beauty begins with the word &quot; mom , &quot; because they see her heart before they see her skin , because she &apos;s only ever always been amazing .
and right behind him is l. ron hubbard . so -- you can see we &apos;re in the ascot , which is always good .
and , of course , it &apos;s not just about navigation , but about manipulation as well .
that &apos;s a bipedal octopus that &apos;s disguised as a rolling coconut .
now in the early &apos; 70s , one of the great programs in india was to revitalize primary science in village schools .
young women who live in areas with high maternal mortality change their behavior less in response to hiv than young women who live in areas with low maternal mortality .
what &apos;s more likely , and we &apos;re seeing it today , is that data gets sent to a local manufacturing center .
it &apos;s a cadence you can &apos;t quite imagine .
i mean look , you can see the necktie , but you can &apos;t even imagine seeing the size of a little , small atom .
the basis of human trust is established through play signals .
was there a sense from them of a narrative that things were kind of tough and bad , or was there a narrative of some kind of level of growth , that things over time were getting better ?
what we &apos;re doing is we are seizing control of our evolutionary future .
you didn &apos;t react to that , so it &apos;s four letters in the title .
and i could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest .
and next you &apos;re going to see the long-lived mutant when it &apos;s young .
this makes testing spider silk really , really easy to do in the laboratory , because we &apos;re actually , you know , testing it in air that &apos;s exactly the environment that spiders are using their silk proteins .
i think it &apos;s a fantastic system , but i think leaving it to phd candidates is far too few people , and way too late in life .
well it means if you them together you suddenly have circuits -- circuits that the most creative , tiny , little hands can build on their own .
it would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly .
now let &apos;s look at the continent as a whole .
it &apos;s really the rule-based , regimented education system in india that is responsible for killing all creativity . &quot;
it &apos;s incredibly difficult because it &apos;s highly inter-disciplinary .
anagnorisis is the greek word for discovery .
and the second thing is , we &apos;re going to restructure its architecture .
so , the chinese are very good at these puns and alternative wording and even memes .
i married my high school sweetheart , jane .
what it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night , so the mosquitos that bite late at night can &apos;t get at them .
and they turned at once and walked away .
these are the dark pools where global supply chains begin -- the global supply chains , which bring us our favorite brand name products .
why were certain words born before others ?
all you have to do is play with it , change it a little bit , and come up with something that does help , that does work .
so we have come a long way from those days where the telephone has become an instrument of empowerment , and really has changed the way indians think of technology .
you know the words i mean ?
and it &apos;s also just getting to the essential of things .
every small obstacle , every slight uphill , would cause these fellows to stop in their tracks and give up .
you cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore .
i would consider the studio more like a laboratory .
it &apos;s composed of four subunits : a , c , g and t , we call them .
next olympics , you can bet that oscar , or one of oscar &apos;s successors , is going to make the time .
you can tether a fly to a little stick .
and all i &apos;m saying is that i really wish that murray gell-mann would go on oprah and just explain to her that the law of attraction is , in fact , not a law .

all his predecessors have been all those three , and that &apos;s the point i was trying to make .
age is another thing when our attitude toward our appearance changes .
you can imagine building up some library , whether real or virtual , of fingerprints of essentially every virus .
now if we just flick back and forth between those two , you can see what a staggering difference there was between reality and what doctors , patients , commissioners of health services , and academics were able to see in the peer-reviewed academic literature .
you have sweatshops in hells .
and you can win when you &apos;re outscored .
by mandate , you cannot make a person compassionate .
so , the premise in the studio was , there are no boundaries , there is no fear .
i think it &apos;s the most important legislation of 2006 . why ?
and to be balanced , i believe we have to attend to all of those areas -- not just do 50 stomach crunches .
and i referenced that at the end of my last talk .
and people say , &quot; well , that &apos;s terribly brave because what happens if derek doesn &apos;t know it ? &quot;
they had all sorts of different data formats , all sorts , all kinds of documentation systems .
it changes what we see . it changes what we remember .
uttar pradesh , the biggest of the states here , is poorer and has a lower health than the rest of india .
so how does it work ?
people go out and upgrade their toilet .
and so computers , as you know , these big computers , there are now tiny computers .
we say to ourselves , &quot; maybe we can make fish sticks with it or something . &quot;
we &apos;ve got a bigger conversation about israel and palestine radiating outwards from the middle east .
there are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide what the right thing is to do , and those are errors in estimating the odds that they &apos;re going to succeed , and errors in estimating the value of their own success .

so i wish you the best of all possible journeys and the courage to speak softly .
and we can use this system to test dietary factors at concentrations that are obtainable by eating .
now if you like any of those outcomes , you can support reinventing fire without needing to like all of them and without needing to agree about which of them is most important .

you can put shoes on your feet ; you can play golf with golf clubs ; and chewed up bubble gum doesn &apos;t do anything at all for you .
very expensive , they throw them out for money , then cutting trees again .
and , it would arrive at an agreement that everybody was happy with , without having to manipulate them so much -- which is basically what i do , i manipulate them .
now what i want to convince you of is the brain also goes through a lot of effort to reduce the negative consequences of this sort of noise and variability .
in global terms , it &apos;s a little bit of money .
these examples are just the first glimpse of our ignorance of life on this planet .
the issue is not that .
fabulous , colorful , anecdotal stories .
and if it is -- and particularly given the fact that we came very close to extinction .
can &apos;t love the whole world -- you &apos;ve got to work on trees , or you &apos;ve got to work on immigration .
it &apos;s used as a symbol for transformation .
there &apos;s no need .
and so this is very important .
and you did a very , very , very bad thing .
so now we had a system that we could actually take to some place that was kind of like an oasis on the bottom of the ocean that might be patrolled by large predators .
once again , that &apos;s sierra leone .
so there is no point in replacing a set of poor country diseases with a set of rich country diseases .
and she didn &apos;t answer the damn question !
what are you going to do ?
can you get down ?
i &apos;m working on an initiative now , along with the world bank , on asset recovery , trying to do what we can to get the monies that have been taken abroad -- developing countries &apos; moneys -- to get that sent back .
that is how our 2010 retrofit is saving over two-fifths of the energy in the empire state building -- remanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on site into super windows that pass light , but reflect heat .
and we need that relationship to reflect , to reclaim hope .
now it &apos;s also very hard to intuit these results . think about it for yourself .
as teenagers -- just think back to your teenage years -- we &apos;re going through a dramatic and often disproportionate change in our facial appearance .
and this enables them to orient in complete darkness .
and now let &apos;s rerun the simulation putting one of these superorganisms into a population of free-riders , of defectors , of cheaters and look what happens .
they &apos;re looking at pakistan and bangladesh , and they &apos;re also looking at africa .
so now i do that tuesday morning jump , but it &apos;s not any jump -- that was september 11th , 2001 .
now , there &apos;s over 4,000 rabbits across the united states and 5,000 more on the waiting list .
we can use these data now to provide other regions with recipes and the same technology .
and they loved him . you need a symbol of something .
most towns at least have a 3g connection .
so to sum up : twenty years ago , i had a college adviser tell me , when i went to the college and said , &quot; i &apos;m kind of interested in anatomy , &quot; they said , &quot; anatomy &apos;s a dead science . &quot;
i &apos;ve camped my whole life . and i decided that living in a van for a year to do this would be like one long camping trip .
thank you .
it could . it has the genetic information .
so we need to understand where our competence is and isn &apos;t .
it &apos;s an american , american soldiers , american woman who lost her loved one in the middle east -- in iraq or afghanistan .
in particular , textbooks and the kind of educational materials that we use every day in school .
they were used first by a danish newspaper , which wanted to make a point on islam .
so , to do , action , take-away . so , here &apos;s what i would say : there &apos;s only one machine , and the web is its os .
these machines would think they -- these organisms , if they came back to life now -- whether they &apos;ve died and gone to heaven , there &apos;s a universe .
and i wanted to tell her , and i want to tell you , we need to stop letting disease divorce us from our dreams .

and what you &apos;re looking at here and if the title &quot; searching for armillaria death rings , &quot; sounds ominous , it is .
and nanny &apos;s great insight , really , was to think , here &apos;s a child who can &apos;t see .
small roundabouts are starting to appear .
so the organizers asked me to end with a bold speculation .
so i communicate through everything from radio transceivers to funnels and plastic tubing .
in other words -- feel sympathy , rather than contempt .
he said , &quot; well , look at it . there &apos;s so many spanish , american , hispanic characters in it , but there &apos;s only one turkish character and it &apos;s a man . &quot;
everything that we could get out of genbank -- that is , the national repository of sequences .
they don &apos;t spend time alone .
you may have seen this in other forms , but the top line is the amount of protected area on land , globally , and it &apos;s about 12 percent .
there were so many things new to me .
the kid with the red stripe was in the program two years ago -- he &apos;s now an instructor .
so they calculate the percent annual growth rate of &#91; the &#93; economy .
so , it all worked out well .
people have wanted to look inside the human mind , the human brain , for thousands of years .
you can see that this one has names carved into its trunk , but it also records some natural events .
this image i &apos;ve decided to show having a reservation about it .
i know it sounds complicated ; it &apos;s not -- i just don &apos;t want you to think you &apos;re seeing something out of &quot; rain man &quot; here .

i mean , people didn &apos;t build ipods for 10,000 dollars 10 years ago .
i would tell them , &quot; it &apos;s because i have to talk tomorrow . &quot;
why is that important ?
this is the gay lifestyle .
good lord -- we know that term now .

but it leads to what is coming next .
water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather , and growing up in these tough situations , at the age of 17 , i was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter , and we were sunbathing .
and these strands of magnetic field inside the superconductor , they come in discrete quantities .
here are some examples .
and she said , &quot; how are you ? &quot;
and i think we need to support all of the dreams of the kids out there doing these crazy things .
these are just a few of the ideas that are to die for .
and , over time , we started understanding and systematically researching what this tinkering ecosystem is about , because that is something that &apos;s happening not just in one street corner in mumbai .
in the u.s. only one percent of the people are actually farmers .
i am a conductor , and i &apos;m here today to talk to you about trust .
let me begin with my parents .
so this is a computer program .
so we have this field of science that &apos;s all about slime , and color changes . check this out .
this should have been given to a boy . we can &apos;t do this . &quot;
but what if we organize spraying graffiti throughout the night all over krakow city ? the city will know .
how would their lives be different ? their impact ?
well , if we are , it &apos;s an awful waste of space .
we can &apos;t see it most of the time . it &apos;s invisible .
that &apos;s what technology really wants .
and they didn &apos;t even know .
lots of stuff . there &apos;s a little leaf chair -- that golden looking thing is called &quot; leaf . &quot;
there is something more though that has to be there .
like i said , pollen carries the male sex cells .
it &apos;s called the standard model -- beautifully simple mathematical equation .
and we have to realize that we are all going to into this , down to here .
biophonies and geophonies are the signature voices of the natural world , and as we hear them , we &apos;re endowed with a sense of place , the true story of the world we live in .
we &apos;re now in the era of super-enabling the surgeon who can now go inside the body and do things with robotic surgery , which is here today , at a level that was not really possible even five years ago .
i said , &quot; stand behind them .
and that &apos;s an icosahedron , which is one of the five sacred solids , very important shapes .
get writing .
and especially since about 2007 , when i got an iphone , i was not only sitting in front of my screen all day , but i was also getting up at the end of the day and looking at this little screen that i carried in my pocket .
so this isn &apos;t expensive pumps or valves .
usman riaz : yes , that was the first one . and then i -- that was the first thing i learned , and then i started progressing to other things .
one third of americans .
&quot; of course , what you are doing , &quot; he said to the rich man , &quot; is answering god &apos;s plea that we should be compassionate .
and curiously , in these systems , as they grow larger , the systems don &apos;t converge ; they diverge more .
but this is crucial habitat and it &apos;s where they spend the first two , three years of their lives , until they &apos;re big enough to go out on the rest of the reef .
so we &apos;ve been studying the babies using a technique that we &apos;re using all over the world and the sounds of all languages .
thank you .
you just mix up some pollen , sugar and water , and whatever active ingredient you want to put in , and you just give it right to the bees . no chemicals involved , just immune boosters .
now that statistic is quite shocking .
his veterinarian only gave him three months to live .
our lives depend upon these creatures .
we turn facts into similes and metaphors , and even fantasies .
what they &apos;re proposing is an almost four-times increase in production , and that would industrialize an area the size of florida .
but the point i &apos;m trying to make , though , is that it &apos;s not enough for us to criticize .
it &apos;s a big blank sheet on our planet . we &apos;ll map it within hours , have the maps disseminated out to the major universities .
so chinese in china , censorship is normal .
it &apos;s got bumps on the back of its wing covers .
here you see baseball players .
they don &apos;t really go to the usual place that memories go .
we &apos;re going to go on a dive to the deep sea , and anyone that &apos;s had that lovely opportunity knows that for about two and half hours on the way down , it &apos;s a perfectly positively pitch-black world .
our fears provoke in us a very similar form of suspense .

and sometimes he assists that with his hands , sometimes even with the leg .
sea level rise threatens coastal ecosystems , agriculture , even major cities . this is what one to two meters of sea level rise looks like in the mekong delta .
and again , it will need money .
i didn &apos;t quite get it . and paul rand was a kind of crusty designer , you know , a crusty designer , like a good -- kind of like a good french bread ?

so one thing i want to encourage you to think about is the idea of what an urban island is .
as you can see , these are the footprints of the different projects .
the way this showed up in the textbook , it looked like this : &quot; bacteriophage replication is initiated through the introduction of viral nucleic acid into a bacterium . &quot;
this cannot be . &quot;
these human-induced alterations occupying overall less than a millionth of the elapsed lifetime and seemingly occurring with runaway speed ?
it led to the building on the left .
1991 , &apos; 92 , we found a finance minister and a prime minister willing to let the world look at india , rather than be this great country of intrigue and mystery in this closed country .
they &apos;re smaller than a wavelength of light , so we have no way to directly observe them .
they invest in professional development and collaboration and many other things .
but the dutch people here will understand what i mean .
and this is just an illustration .
we &apos;ve had hbo here this morning . i &apos;m wondering if mark burnett is anywhere in the audience , i &apos;d like to suggest a reality tv show called &quot; pre-vivor . &quot;

the frame and radii of this web is made up of one type of silk , while the capture spiral is a composite of two different silks : the filament and the sticky droplet .
i design for that condition , biopolymers . it &apos;s the future .
this divide between what &apos;s happening on the ground and perceptions abroad is one of the key reasons why we don &apos;t have yet a palestinian peaceful resistance movement that has been successful .
every &quot; mistake &quot; is an opportunity in jazz .

and -- so i was getting pretty nervous and , you know , i didn &apos;t know that chris sits on the stage , and that &apos;s more nerve wracking .
and if you go back about 50 years , bill and ted were leading remarkably similar lives .
the one i &apos;m going to make is that it is time for us to reclaim what peace really means .
how to measure , if we have planets where the amount of those elements is small , so those planets are tectonically dead , there cannot be life .
and he might be right .
so , if you &apos;re with me , i &apos;d say there &apos;s three essential steps in this crowdsourcing campaign : collecting , connecting and committing .
&quot; i have this great project -- 50 million years . &quot;
but this wasn &apos;t always the way .
the world that meant a lot to me , i saw it vanish in my face .
but then , if you know everything you can know about those two things , and you put them together , what can you say about this combination ?
and the ironic thing about it is that they are not staving off the aquatic theory to protect a theory of their own , which they &apos;ve all agreed on , and they love .
so hannah &apos;s approach , on the other hand , is to formulate a series of techniques for creating unusual objects that free us from pre-designed constraints by teaching us about the materials themselves .
and a professor in the university of massachusetts , in the zoology department , bought this climber because she wanted to study the insect diversity of the top of the tree canopy .
that &apos;s when i decided i had to do something .

and he showed her the lever .
after all , public safety is too important to leave to the professionals .
and here he is six years later , guinness , with his very happy owner .
there &apos;s problem after problem , and i think what really separates this time from any time i can remember in my brief time on earth is the awareness of these problems .
they &apos;re asked , &quot; are you running out of food at the end of the month ?
doug hofstadter wonders , well , maybe our intelligence just isn &apos;t great enough to understand our intelligence , and if we were smarter , well , then our brains would be that much more complicated , and we &apos;d never catch up to it .

you have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is , how it can be changed .
and we leave the normal stuff on the floor .
you believe i &apos;m looking at you .
i propose to explore this idea further , to examine the potential of creating kind of service to stop bribes and prevent corruption .
what struck me also was how much the city was changing around me .
she rocketed to the top of her class .
i mean , i couldn &apos;t take your phones off you if i wanted to .
in some cases , another species like the north american leopard frog showed that males exposed to atrazine grew eggs in their testes .
although we &apos;re not the first ones to find bacteria that can break down phthalates , we were the first ones to look into our local river and find a possible solution to a local problem .
thank you very much .
and if nasa doesn &apos;t do it , china might , or somebody in this room might write a big check .
apparently , lucifer means &quot; the light . &quot;
we have one here and notice its position . it &apos;s holding on .
so that &apos;s basically perfectly safe , uncrackable .
the village became a real standout .
but the more i talked about it , the more objectified and fragmented my body became .
catastrophes that we can avert are not as interesting as ones we could avert .
why did they not die ?
in fact , they have no legislative status in ireland whatsoever , despite our importance for the species and also the historical context within which basking sharks reside .

a third interview was conducted with someone about the north pole .
so this was prozac , this was zoloft , this was a black jellybean and this was muscle relaxant , all of which were the medications that the impatient was taking .
matters of principle aside , practically speaking , these laws drive hiv underground .
and you turn around , and you look back into the space , and some people talk aloud .
there you go . that &apos;s connection .
but wouldn &apos;t it be an easy matter to wire a wall switch so that it triggers the muted horn of a steam ship ?
so it &apos;s cool .
one has lacrosse on the near side of town .
imagine way back , four and a half billion years ago , there is a vast chemical soup of stuff .
if we aren &apos;t going to be afraid of conflict , we have to see it as thinking , and then we have to get really good at it .

india .
and this is just a very simple way of understanding what kind of innovation , what kind of different design we need .
and they said scaling , which is the build-up of minerals inside of pipes .
and we harvest those seeds , and those are the wheat kernels .
that &apos;s a tragedy for those populations , but it &apos;s also a tragedy for the people eating them because they don &apos;t know that that &apos;s toxic meat .
they &apos;ve survived for millennia in desert , in the permafrost , at the tops of mountains and at the bottom of the ocean .
it &apos;s imperative to me , when i look around the world , that we need to change ourselves .
but none of that &apos;s in my medical record .
put all of those bonds at one place and they sit down and click .
so we actually tried to commission some crash tests .
on the right we have little emmalou -- southern family .
but he started the country on a path of a positive cycle .
so why was it that , just a few nights later , as i stood in that same e.r. and determined that my diabetic patient did indeed need an amputation , why did i hold her in such bitter contempt ?
but we &apos;re also left with a concentrated salt solution , or brine .
now , while the eameses were exploring those possibilities , they were also exploring physical objects .

today i want to tell you why .

there &apos;s enormous interest in this in a variety of different fields .
i was taking on a socially embarrassing question with an answer that he thought might not be particularly interesting .
but most convincingly when we had to confront the idea of changing costs from architecture to infrastructure , is something that is represented by this .
so social and psychological research reveals how ordinary , good people can be transformed without the drugs .

you can go there with other people , have any kind of experience with anyone involving all of the senses .
what is a conscious mind ?
models can come from industry .
okay . fast forward .

to see -- wait a minute , we can go kshhplash ! -- right there , ha -- under the ocean , see what the whales see .
i said , &quot; what &apos;s gone ? &quot;

it &apos;s complete security theater .
so here , all of a sudden , we &apos;re looking at a map of the human heart .

he was exhausted , and rob was staying with him .
today i want to talk to you about ethnic conflict and civil war .
from now on we count per capita .
we get into even smaller micro-robots that will eventually autonomously move through your system again and be able to do things that surgeons can &apos;t do in a much less invasive manner .
i &apos;m not holding these out as being the biggest issues .
they give meaning to our lives .
i bring to you a message from tens of thousands of people -- in the villages , in the slums , in the hinterland of the country -- who have solved problems through their own genius , without any outside help .

we &apos;d spent a lot of time designing this bridge , and we &apos;d analyzed it , we &apos;d checked it to codes -- to heavier loads than the codes -- and here it was doing something that we didn &apos;t know about .
again , same choice ; they can play it safe for always getting two grapes every single time , or they can take a risky bet and choose between one and three .
this work has been done with an extraordinary group of people , and they &apos;ve done all the work , and i &apos;m the great bullshitter that tries to bring it all together .
and if we can change enough communities , we can change national attitudes .
and he works this system .
jm : thank you all .
this abalone shell is a biocomposite material that &apos;s 98 percent by mass calcium carbonate and two percent by mass protein .
this is a kind of hacker &apos;s manual , and it &apos;s written in chinese and english .
now , by remoteness , i mean two or three different kinds of things .
i went to school in a little school called mount allison university in sackville , new brunswick , and on my last day there , a girl came up to me and she said , &quot; i remember the first time that i met you . &quot;
so , i wanted to play with cheetos in some way .
that said , i don &apos;t wish to be seen as regretting the life i could have had if i &apos;d not been mentally ill , nor am i asking anyone for their pity .

it leaches out chemicals into the flesh of the poor critter that ate it , and then we come along and eat that poor critter , and we get some of the toxins accumulating in our bodies as well .
now we &apos;ll turn a little bit more ... now it &apos;s not funny -- in this way , we can actually learn something about the architecture of the brain , the functional architecture of the brain .
i lived in ireland , built the first straw-bale houses in ireland , and some cob buildings and all this kind of thing .
they &apos;re called millennium development goals .
benki is a leader of the ashaninka nation .

from the outside , behind this always-changing facade , you see how the fixed concrete beams provide a framework for the inhabitants to create their homes in an organic , intuitive way that responds directly to their needs .
so i repeated the experiment . i went 300 miles out of delhi into a really remote village where the chances of a passing software development engineer was very little .

they finally see you . it takes more time to get your electrocardiogram on your skin and diagnose it , and it &apos;s hard to do because they don &apos;t have the baseline data , which the computer we put in you gets .
when the planes struck and the towers collapsed , many of these women experienced the same horrors inflicted on other survivors of the disaster -- the overwhelming chaos and confusion , the rolling clouds of potentially toxic dust and debris , the heart-pounding fear for their lives .
you can &apos;t not know who you are , so you cling to hard-matter identity .

now , many of you know that the patriot act is a legislation that greatly reduces the liberties of americans in order to protect them against terrorism .
once there was a princess who whistled beautifully .
instead of explaining their research with words , scientists have to explain it with dance .
and that grew to 160,000 students from 209 countries .
this is important , because many times students , they fear or they feel uncomfortable how others might think about their opinions and thoughts .
and i &apos;ll let her take it from there .
maybe realizing that the number is just eight percent might help cool some of the superheated rhetoric that we see around the immigration issue .
you can &apos;t just expect it to work . you have to get out and work . &quot;
and in that non-verbal portion , there &apos;s some serious magic .
and then with an instrument we have on board , a radar instrument , we found there are lakes like the great lakes in here , so it looks very much like earth .
mass timber panels are those 24-dot bricks .
so like fox mulder on &quot; x-files , &quot; who wants to believe in ufos ? well , we all do , and the reason for that is because we have a belief engine in our brains .
you place the muscle cells on the outside .
those expert trackers have got to be part of the pack .

you can &apos;t create this with standard manufacturing techniques even if you tried to do it manually .
do we have any idea how we could have defeated neanderthals if they also had language ?
and what &apos;s good about this , i think , is that it &apos;s like a moment in time , like you &apos;ve turned around , you &apos;ve got x-ray vision and you &apos;ve taken a picture with the x-ray camera .
you just point a camera at a class , and it always looks like this .

and i know that with the cheetahs , we can take africa back one village at a time .
people keep asking that when they read my book , &quot; the quark and the jaguar , &quot; and they say , &quot; isn &apos;t there something more beyond what you have there ? &quot;
it opens and closes like a bread bin .
and now , all six cups . should i do it on the first try or should i miss once on purpose ?
where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm &apos;s length from politics ?
now the way they propose to do this is to identify sites that are substantially infringing on copyright -- although how those sites are identified is never fully specified in the bills -- and then they want to remove them from the domain name system .
but the companies withheld that data from them , and so did the european medicines agency for three years .
and it doesn &apos;t just stay on the screen .
i thought , look at the impact that my research has had .
caroline lavelle : casting a spell on the cello
i &apos;ve been carrying on here about the biology of love .
when steve sillett gets up into a big redwood , he fires an arrow , which trails a fishing line , which gets over a branch in the tree , and then you ascend up a rope which has been dragged into the tree by the line .

a search engine can determine who shall live and who shall die .
and it happened in large part here because the expert got the statistics horribly wrong , in two different ways .
a group of artists decided to paint a life-size tank on a wall . it &apos;s one to one .

the real estate ads in the neighborhood all very proudly proclaim , &quot; walking distance to le grande orange , &quot; because it provided its neighborhood with what sociologists like to call &quot; a third place . &quot;

and once you have that , you can actually begin to build the neocortical column .
&quot; even if i were hungry , i would not drink a bowl of my favorite soup if it had been stirred by a used but thoroughly washed fly-swatter . &quot;
the amount of genetic data -- basically this shows that smooth exponential growth doubled every year , enabling the genome project to be completed .
you pump it at a high pressure through a nozzle .
so there &apos;s been many studies , including this one , that show that if you use active learning , interacting with your students in the classroom , performance improves on every single metric -- on attendance , on engagement and on learning as measured by a standardized test .
it &apos;s not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage .
this is a moose .
but he watched physicists and chemists become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction in the early 20th century .
so , what is thinking in pictures ? it &apos;s literally movies in your head .
we &apos;re so good at overcoming our biological limitations -- you know , i flew over here in an airplane .
and if a cloud goes past , you can see a cloud on the tips where it &apos;s letting the light through .
i thought narcissism meant you loved yourself .

so i think , yes , there may be ways that non-lethal weapons are going to be great in these situations , but there &apos;s also a whole heap of problems that need to be considered as well .
so , i started out in &apos; 95 with this exhibition that was called mutant materials in contemporary design .
and that changed everything for me . it was totally life changing .
could we have fuel without fear ?
six to eight months , they &apos;re totally equivalent .
the international cat video film festival didn &apos;t have that much of a reaction .
she reaches into her purse and hands him a 20 .
and so i &apos;m going to talk a little bit about that , keeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here .
so , what is the deal here ?
he said , &quot; dave , i pulled up the x-ray image on the screen on the computer at home . &quot;
they were killing people . they were doing whatever they want because they have power .
we &apos;ve driven in cities , like in san francisco here .
so , for example , if i was angry and had to hide it , which i often did , being very adept at concealing how i really felt , then the voice would sound frustrated .

we &apos;ve got plenty of these things .
this is a social map of the hijackers and their associates who perpetrated the 9 / 11 attack .
this has come &apos; round to be that all those naked pachyderms have aquatic ancestors .
they &apos;re encoded in the dna .
and i said , &quot; shallow affect : an inability to experience a range of emotions . &quot;
so he &apos;s got memory .
ten million americans already have this for one reason or another , but really worryingly , 16 percent -- roughly one in six -- of american teenagers suffer from noise-induced hearing disorder as a result of headphone abuse .
because if we can do that , if we can actually just collect the data electronically , digitally , from the very beginning , we can just put a shortcut right through that whole process of typing , of having somebody type that stuff into the computer .
we hope that all of you will come to see the allosphere .
the hard problem that alice chose was the rising incidence of childhood cancers .
when public sector debt is low , governments don &apos;t have to choose between investing in education and health and paying interest on that debt you owe .
there are microbes which , through their metabolism , produce hydrogen sulfide , and they do so in large amounts .
all i know is how to make refrigerators . &quot;
maybe you think about the tragically boring board games that hold us hostage in thanksgiving situations .
that was our hf radio antenna .
i want to show you some moments of history in my journey , which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world .
rd : yeah ?
biology -- we have co-adapted through biology to like bright colors .
janet echelman found her true voice as an artist when her paints went missing -- which forced her to look to an unorthodox new art material . now she makes billowing , flowing , building-sized sculpture with a surprisingly geeky edge . a transporting 10 minutes of pure creativity .
here you see a patent for an arm in 1912 .
do you remember what it was ?
she did it because she ran a country that had a national health service .
and hopefully in the next five years , i &apos;ll be giving you a tedtalk on that .
of course we don &apos;t .
we just need you to be authentic and real and say , &quot; we &apos;re sorry .
it turns out that , in fact , the world was given this gift in 1738 by a dutch polymath named daniel bernoulli .
that &apos;s before we got up to the four bucks a gallon .
suppose the rules are : every time you offer somebody a drink , you give them the drink , and you give them your styrofoam peanuts too .
audience : 93 .
because i tried to make it intimate .
i mean , these are state assets .
so the next time that one called i let him get halfway through his spiel and then i said , &quot; you sound sexy . &quot;
delusions and hallucinations are hallmarks of the illness .
if a child soils its nappy at 8 : 30 , he will have to wait several hours before it can be changed again .
now , my breakthrough came in a very unlikely place , possibly the most unlikely place for innovation : my high school biology class , the absolute stifler of innovation .
so this work is nothing but like -- because of the focal length of the lens , it just shows what is on the other side .
and it turns out that different things crystallize out at different stages .
we saw how ps 234 worked .
now you might wonder , how can people fit in a tiny village only this big ?
however , to me , the 500 is really just the first 500 .
and aren &apos;t we grateful for our brains that can , you know , take this electrical impulse that comes from light energy to create images in order for us to explore our world ?
the sun burns our peripheral vision .
so i cold-called the ceo of prostate cancer canada , and i said to him , &quot; i have this most amazing concept . &quot;
there &apos;s a clock , clock , clock , clock .
by month 12 , we could argue whether there &apos;s a little bit of material around the edges , but it &apos;s essentially completely gone .
now , that &apos;s a great idea , but what i &apos;d like to say is that , in fact , this is a great metaphor for the way that ideas happen .
we wanted to know if what is being done is effective .
and we &apos;re a pretty small staff , which is me .
but then i started thinking about my family .
high pressure builds over india .
now , the africa progress panel , led by kofi annan , they &apos;ve calculated that congo may have lost more than 1.3 billion dollars from these deals .
and we don &apos;t have any industry at all -- it &apos;s only because of this deforestation .
and i went off on assignment and came back a week later , and father keene said , &quot; i &apos;ve got to talk to you about hyun-sook . &quot;
i &apos;ll let you hear a sample of that voice .
now i &apos;m going to show you this in 3d .
but at any rate , they are there .
and i will try and explain to you what &apos;s wrong with this notion .
if you take this thing , you know very well it weighs very little .
but that &apos;s not the prime candidate for life in the solar system .
by expressing it as an if-then statement , you can get the message across without appearing to boss another person around .
proteins are targets for drugs .
here you &apos;re looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe and you &apos;re seeing billions of galaxies , right , and nodes , but you realize they &apos;re not even the main structure .
this lady , she developed a herbal pesticide formulation .
we see that there is no quick fix .
even the sutherlands told me that they had an agile thanksgiving , where you had one group of people working on the food , one setting the table , and one greeting visitors at the door .
why is it that martin luther king led the civil rights movement ?
how clever would we have to be ?
our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each , on minute timescales .
some people actually come back and say , &quot; oh , you want to screw me . let me show you what i can do . &quot;
or are there contexts where we &apos;re far better off taking the passenger &apos;s seat and have someone else drive ?
thanks for having me .
and not works for the left or the right , but works for the left and the right , the citizens of the left and right , because there is no sensible reform possible until we end this corruption .
krista donaldson : the $ 80 prosthetic knee that &apos;s changing lives
for reversing disease , that &apos;s what it takes , but if you &apos;re just trying to be healthy , you have a spectrum of choices .
because i realized that nature had invented reproduction as a mechanism for life to move forward , as a life force that passes right through us and makes us a link in the evolution of life .
i had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak , looking like the michelin man .
so rovs aren &apos;t new .
jl : i won &apos;t use them . thank you .
the first two are shared with many , many other species , and they are really coming out largely of the brain stem and whatever there is of cortex in those species .
this material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true .
please join us in this epic adventure .
but remember , the people in baghdad , the people in iraq , the people in afghanistan -- they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day .
321 is 103,041 . 103,041 .
and they &apos;re now fully capable of handling any of the loads you would see in flight -- just like putting down your convertible top .
now some of you might actually right now be thinking , it &apos;s downright crazy to have 10 tedtalks summarized into just six words .
diane downs : at night when i close my eyes , i can see christie reaching her hand out to me while i &apos;m driving , and the blood just kept coming out of her mouth .
there is the orange system .
i believe this is going to democratize health care .
the director of the program said , &quot; come back tomorrow . &quot;
five years later , those women lived twice as long , and you can see that the people -- and that was the only difference between the groups .
this film shows the testing of a new explosive fill on a warhead .
so i can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fresh perspective and see if i can optimize it in its most idealistic fashion .
and it began when i flew back from london after my time at the u.n. in kosovo .
now , the shortcut .
mtv europe worked with us and made that spoof , and they &apos;ve been slipping it in between music videos without any introduction , which i think is kind of fun .
this experience of working with duke also led me to initiate a program called sound science .
we can &apos;t sustain this without the measure of our success really changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red .
but he was , in fact , a moral philosopher , and he was right on why we &apos;re moral .
but the interesting thing is , of those three , india &apos;s looking real good , as you just saw in the data .
here &apos;s the virgin mary on the backside , which they started to wipe off .
the split starts to emerge between those in the military who see a future they can live with , and those who see a future that starts to scare them , like the u.s. submarine community , which watches the soviet navy disappear overnight .
in this map from moldova , the green color shows those districts that have low spending on schools but good educational outcomes , and the red color shows the opposite .
there are all these different things for us to get the data that we need to do .
it &apos;s little discrete -- that &apos;s spelled d-i-s-c-r-e-t-e -- bits .
it happens when i dance , when i &apos;m acting .
i &apos;m a storyteller .
this room may appear to be holding 600 people , but there &apos;s actually so many more , because in each one of us there is a multitude of personalities .
there were 20 ph.d. &apos; s plus me and the professor crammed into this tiny office space with them firing these rapid-fire questions at me , trying to sink my procedure .
and when we said to our parents and grandparents , &quot; how would you feel if tomorrow morning you woke up black ? &quot;
and i think that institutions should stand up and release all their data under unrestricted licenses , and it would be a great benefit to everybody .
the second school i was at had big trees too , had a fantastic tulip tree , i think it was the biggest in the country , and it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation around it , around the playing fields .
it &apos;s the kind of original movement for any puppet for us onstage .
shea hembrey : how i became 100 artists
and here &apos;s the peeling action of the mecho-gecko .
she picks the water up from there , desalinates it , for free , transports it over there , and dumps it onto the mountains , rivers , and streams .
so , because nobody in their straight mind would row straight past hawaii without dropping in , i decided to cut this very big undertaking into three segments .
it &apos;s a full spectrum of tools .
plan b appeared in its first full-blown form in 1998 -- something called the digital millennium copyright act .
very soon we will all be dead and gone , but the problems will stay , unless we have people taking over from where we stopped .
to say ahh , if this happens then we are going to have a pandemic ?
so , everyone told me afterwards that inviting the prospective parents over was , again , the stupidest thing i could have possibly done , because who &apos;s ever good enough for your relative ?
he mumbled something about his mother , and i told him she &apos;d probably find him outside anyway .
she &apos;s 16 years old .
so that is the house of tata .
and that means that if we want to avail ourselves of it , we &apos;re allowed to postulate chemical events in the origin of life which have a probability as low as one in 100 billion billion .
you can &apos;t just look at the dessert cart as say , &quot; no , no , no . that looks disgusting to me . &quot;
volcanoes erupt .
and that was , of course , the very common story .
and this is all big raised platform .
school -- and remember , i made it through one year , so i think i &apos;m qualified to talk on school -- is a game , it &apos;s just not a terribly well-designed game , right .
john q. walker : great piano performances , recreated
my colleagues and i have been working for 10 years to rediscover this lost world in a project we call the mannahatta project .
what about a wolf ?
and then it bursts into a forest of redwoods .
well my personal story , my personal journey , what brings me to the ted stage here today , is a demonstration of exactly what &apos;s been happening in muslim-majority countries over the course of the last decades , at least , and beyond .
when we look at a map of los angeles or london , it is hard to believe that as of 2005 , only 15 percent of the world was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail .
and we thought it had something to do with this protein called amp kinase , an energy protein .
why would daddy bring elder revels ?
i see a lot of hands coming down .
and the way i look at it is : if you don &apos;t have knives and forks in your school , you &apos;re purely endorsing , from a state level , fast food , because it &apos;s handheld .
and we helped him build a company , for profit , that would build on ide &apos;s knowledge , and start looking at sales and exports , and be able to tap into other kinds of capital .
who &apos;s going after chinese , which now has 400 million internet users out there ?
it is about action .
and i plan to start from a cliff , like catapulted from a cliff .
and so this is one of the great challenges that is going to happen .
so now the next question you may have is , well why can &apos;t we just pay people to do this ?
we felt like we were surrogate parents .
you may not appreciate the person , you may not appreciate anything else , but maybe you appreciate the fact that they &apos;ve got a tough gig .
this is like -- it feels like the united nations just here .
and he says , &quot; well i used to be a banker and now i &apos;m a gold miner . &quot;
it &apos;s called an allele .
and i &apos;m like , knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all a &apos;s .
they will completely lose .
the first is -- death is a big problem .
if they won &apos;t submit , kill them .
sometimes these pieces are mathematical , in that way that i look at a shape and say , what about if i use this and this and this .
but again , that only shows part of the picture .
that &apos;s what i wanted to do .
there &apos;s no manual . this is exactly what you expect , especially if you haven &apos;t interacted with a computer before .
we can &apos;t see into the engine room .
and i &apos;ll just say what i &apos;m about to do . what i &apos;m about to do -- i hope you can recognize that there &apos;s a distorted sine wave , almost a triangular wave upon this hewlett-packard oscilloscope .
and the birds on the floor tend to have lower pitched calls , so that they don &apos;t get distorted when they bounce off the forest floor .
in fact , i &apos;ve heard it said in the disability community that there are really only two types of people : there are those with disabilities , and there are those that haven &apos;t quite found theirs yet .
now , when you think of a coral reef , this is what most people think of : all these big , hard , elaborate corals and lots of bright , colorful fishes and things .
when we landed on the drop-zone , everything had changed .
for example , a trillion dollars of real estate remains uncapitalized in india alone .
so i went to cambridge , because it was really the best place in the world then for x-ray crystallography . and x-ray crystallography is now a subject in , you know , chemistry departments .
in the cities , a lot of the cost of property is actually wrapped up in its speculative value .
this is what &apos;s called a hydrothermal vent .
i wanted a pure thing , and i can &apos;t get it .
thank you .
i parked a different place every night so i would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police .
50 percent of the women accused me of playing a trick , of putting the same color nail polish in both those bottles .
i was having my inscriptions , my admission to biology .
because they &apos;re focused on honoring what is most beautiful about our past and building it into the promise of our future .
that &apos;s my question .
a mexican composer : arturo marquez .
it &apos;s pretty annoying for the fishermen .
so , it &apos;s not quite as good as you might think , you might hope .
i &apos;d like to share with you the story of one of my patients called celine .
and these can be things that maybe you &apos;re already doing .
there &apos;s self-acceptance , there &apos;s family acceptance , and there &apos;s social acceptance .
bf : up and over his shoulders .
and it gets quiet .
and the organisms , i promise you , have all of their priorities in order .
it &apos;s beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration .
the present joins a flow of time from before and after .
well , we feel that now is the time to prove we &apos;re right .
so every grain of sand is unique . every beach is different .
i didn &apos;t feel sick at all .
and something very unusual happens .
the estimated range is between 20 and 50 percent for a series of goals of biodiversity and fishery enhancement and resilience .
thank you .
and this tells me one of two things .
and that &apos;s what that moment with patricia schroeder i think shows : that if we are to bring about an end to the world &apos;s worst atrocities , we have to make it such .
and she said , &quot; no , those are the lights of key west . &quot;
technology is transforming the face of food vulnerability in places where you see classic famine .
did i know anything about this ?
this is from a global survey .
it took quite many years for the program to become what it is now .
and we would visit each other .
and with our hyper-consumption of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease , kindness might just be a bit of a red herring .
kirk citron : and now , the real news
second , the development institutions that channeled these transfers were opaque , with little transparency of what they financed or what results they achieved .
there &apos;s two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change -- so on .
this act defines what a national lottery will look like .
but the media lab is an interesting place , and it &apos;s important to me because as a student , i was a computer science undergrad , and i discovered design later on in my life .
they are not going to touch that , because it &apos;s not your matter .
so , maps of things leading to organized understandings of the universe in which we emerge .
so historically there has been a huge divide between what people consider to be non-living systems on one side , and living systems on the other side .
and this is why things don &apos;t get done at work -- it &apos;s because of the m &amp; amp ; ms.
his mother showed up the next week at my brother &apos;s classroom and begged seven-year-old kids to share with her any picture they may have of her son , for she had lost everything .
three to four feet , it might as well have been a football field away .
if that is indeed true , biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation ?
after that point , they thin out a lot .
and then what the best part is , we started getting a flood of videos in of people doing crazy things with it .
look at this thing and say , &quot; well , i didn &apos;t think i was a very good sleeper , but actually i did better than average in 50 to 60 year olds . &quot; ok ?
white-nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats .
there &apos;s many things about it . it becomes very simple , and basically what you &apos;re doing is you &apos;re just touching the machine , you &apos;re touching the cloud and you &apos;re going to compute that way .
and she said , &quot; but the thing i liked about your talk is you &apos;re a storyteller .
and it goes around and around and around , the same way that military-industrial complex worked a long time ago .
david pizarro : the strange politics of disgust
jh : it looks like we &apos;re loaded for bear here .
that after 10 years , the focus on the construction sector would have produced both jobs and , hence , security -- because young people would have jobs -- and it would have reconstructed the infrastructure .
the quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons .
and so the lesson is this : it doesn &apos;t really matter what you &apos;re selling ; you just have to think about who is your customer , and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior .
when i was a boy , in front of every house in the summer evenings , you would find young people together singing the songs of the day , or the old songs .
what is multimedia-tasking ? it &apos;s the fact that most of us , most of our children , are engaged with listening to music at the same time as they &apos;re doing search on the web at the same time as they &apos;re chatting on facebook with their friends .
in other parts of the world , you have an infrastructure that allows for manufacturing to take place .
i will try to explain to you about the context of why and when i posted .
you cannot ask people to work under these conditions .
and joe was very worried about the device that he was working on .
so if mom does put a blanket over the baby , it &apos;s still receiving effective phototherapy from below .
it &apos;s a dead world . nasa should not spend any time or effort studying mars anymore . &quot;
she only wants to spend time with her friends .
so , when i get those calls about performance , that &apos;s one thing .
the kids were amazing : extremely eager and often very bright .
this is another case where a theoretical paradigm in biology really worked -- was the germ theory of disease .
and coming back to the car , i always used to say that the car is like your mother-in-law : you have to have good relationship with her , but she cannot command your life .
this is a u.s. customs and border protection room , a contraband room , at john f. kennedy international airport .
and fraser &apos;s on his knees , arms tied behind his back , and he &apos;s crying .
and we also use functional mri , called fmri , to take a video , a movie , of brain activity when participants are taking part in some kind of task like thinking or feeling or perceiving something .
what if the sky was 41 percent gray ? wouldn &apos;t that be the perfect sky ? &quot;
the project launched in april 2005 .
now , i have to apologize to our magician friend lennart green .
but probably even more important is that the work that comes out of these years flows back into the company and into society at large , rather than just benefiting a grandchild or two .
when you look at the biggest user and the second largest user , we use 20 million barrels and the chinese use 10 .
and occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin and the two of us enjoy each other , and each one tries to get out of their own , and ultimately it fails of course , and then we &apos;re back into this thing .
the mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this , but not terribly successfully .
as his spirits sagged , his body deteriorated until , i believe , he slowly brought about his own death .
this looks nice .
i know because we have reports from seychelles , which fit in as well , down here .
third step is cognitive dissonance .
so imagine a grid , like the one i &apos;m showing you right now , and now imagine , within that grid , that two-dimensional sheet , imagine neurons .
he happened to be a birder .
but the process itself is without purpose , without foresight , without design .
this is a very good year .
well , who are we not to say this ?
there are , i don &apos;t know , some lessons from all of this , personal and political -- and in a way , they &apos;re the same thing .
to borrow a phrase from carrie fisher , which is in my bio there ; i &apos;ll just toss it out again -- &quot; these days even instant gratification takes too long . &quot;
and afrigadget is a blog that looks at technology in an africa context .
and watch it now slip , and see what it does with its tail .
therefore , any curriculum for training emotion intelligence has to begin with attention training .
in 1967 , in the middle of the biafran-nigerian civil war , dr. njoku-obi invented the cholera vaccine .
so there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now , but the problem with some of them is that they &apos;re not scientific enough .
poverty breeds despair . we know this .
laugh though you will , all the drug dealers and gang members with whom i dealt had one of these long before any police officer i knew did .
but it seems like by investigating , by attacking cancer , by searching where cancer is not , there has got to be something -- there &apos;s got to be something -- that &apos;s making this tissue resistant to tumors .
and that means that there is a one-way transfer of energy from our environment into our homes and cities .
so , it seemed that the toxin that was killing the gharial was something in the food chain , something in the fish they were eating .
and i was protecting the project from it , i realized . i was protecting it -- i didn &apos;t want this special , little group of photographs to get sullied in some way .
i was making all these scribble pictures .
but this is how we do it in the united states .
benki knew this .
when i &apos;m photographing them , i cannot help but remember my grandfather &apos;s lesson .
or , you take this particular un-retouched photograph . now , interestingly enough , i get a lot of emails from people who say , &quot; is there any perceptual difference between males and females ? &quot;
that set me on the road to examining biomechanics .
around each one of our courses , a community of students had formed , a global community of people around a shared intellectual endeavor .
audience : five . five .
this defines the imagined futures of our fellow hungarians -- robicsek , teszler and bartok -- as it does my own .
and i think , look at the tsunami , it &apos;s a classic example .
and it sounds like an easy problem .
audience : oh , 722 .
so , we &apos;re down there , and this is at 400 feet -- that &apos;s looking straight up , by the way , so you can get a sense of how far away the surface is .
since it &apos;s organic , i &apos;m really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals .
she paused and said , &quot; i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s 6,000 yuan or 6,000 american dollars , but anyway , it &apos;s 6,000 . &quot;
this is from my second book .
we self-edit as we &apos;re having ideas .
so we have to be disciplined and focus on things that are critical .
covering the tragic tune with something different , something radically different .
or wait to capture the second half of it .
isn &apos;t that cool ?
and we &apos;ve already started construction on section two .
this is about justice . really .
so i quit my degree , i headed off to the himalayas , i became a monk , and i started studying meditation .
so here is some nectar from my film .
if you go on the streets of india and china , you see this kind of stuff .
it even beeps , because it &apos;s an alarm clock , after all .
so , that &apos;s just one use . incredible , there is probably 350 , 400 uses .
now this is several years ago . adjusted for inflation , it &apos;s a decent sum of money for a few minutes of work .
and then it was only later that i realized how very similar these questions were to the ones i used to ask myself as a child frightened in the night .
it even had an offshoot running to haifa in what is today israel , on the mediterranean sea .
really , this is more about putting the player in the role of george lucas , you know ?
so with that , i &apos;ll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : geography always matters .
of course , africa is a continent full of catastrophes : there are immense ones , such as the horrific rapes in congo and depressing ones , such as the fact that 5,000 people apply for one job vacancy in nigeria .
well , i can tell you that this divergence that you &apos;re seeing here doesn &apos;t happen only in our five-minute experiment .
but with &quot; disappear , &quot; there &apos;s really no analogies -- so evan , what you want to do here is to imagine the cube slowly fading out , okay .
you start sweating to dissipate the heat that you &apos;re going to create from muscular exertion .
because this is the place if aliens land , i hope they come here .
and i don &apos;t know when or how it happened , but the speed at which i went from being a talented writer and journalist to being a homeless woman , living in a van , took my breath away .
and it would be a lovely thing to be able to wave to someone and have all our reiterations wave at the same time .
it &apos;s real , what &apos;s happening .
this is the death star .
during this 60-hour siege on mumbai , 10 men armed not just with weapons , but with technology , were able to bring a city of 20 million people to a standstill .
what you can see over here is tamara , who is holding my phone that &apos;s now plugged in .
if you &apos;ve got that , you &apos;re with me for the entire journey . okay ?
juanita is her name .
we &apos;re talking &apos; 95 now .
in a political campaign , you start with no interest and no capacity to turn that into action .
i can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are .
so what then distinguishes the israeli / palestinian conflict from that in northern ireland , or the civil war in sudan from that in liberia ?
before that , they were all soft , fluffy structures .
thank you .
thanks very much . it &apos;s been an honor .
science has the power to predict the future in many cases now .
thank you .
i control the brain in order to understand how it works .
now , when looking at africa vis-a-vis other things , and countries in africa vis-a-vis other things , comparisons become important .
the surimi sticks &#91; of &#93; crabmeat , or is being sold as crab meat , is white fish that &apos;s being dyed with cochineal .
i needed teachers , in the classroom , every day , who were going to say , &quot; you can move beyond that . &quot;
and every single part of this mechanism is actually plausible in biology .
but it was that work that was seen by alex mcdowell , one of the world &apos;s legendary production designers .
