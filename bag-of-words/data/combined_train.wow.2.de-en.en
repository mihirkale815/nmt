so in summary , while radical openness is great , given how closed we are , even incremental openness could make things dramatically better . thank you very much .
finally , at the end of use , we could biodegrade it naturally along with your vegetable peelings .
it was purchased the year i was born , and it was extraordinary , because i did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information .
british researchers found that one smile can generate the same level of brain stimulation as up to 2,000 bars of chocolate .
we also , like a lot of companies , create a product that &apos;s based on technology trends .
you also have three microprocessors .
and since , in the last 20 years , i &apos;ve developed a studio in london .
there &apos;s the larvae , and they consume most of the food .
this is part of our collective narrative .
once again , these guys rock it out .
we went to them and they said , &quot; look , could you help us ? &quot;
we all know of them , but nevertheless -- the arabs say , &quot; the dogs may bark , but the caravan moves on . &quot;
now it could have come from one of two places .
the asteroids are a substantial amount of real estate , but not very large . and it &apos;s not very promising for life , since most of it consists of rock and metal , mostly rock .
and you never know when you &apos;re going to come across one of these booby traps .
and if there &apos;s one branch that is broken , then very quickly , because of the nodes of crossing -- internet engineers maybe call them hot points -- there are alternative pathways for channeling nutrients and information .
you could tell it wasn &apos;t a real jail .
i develop and test models of the big bang , using observational data .
if you want to keep going , if you want to change the camera angle , you can do that , and because of that , i can show you that voyager 1 doesn &apos;t just fly by saturn .
it &apos;s also full of anchor tenants at 20 dollars a foot -- triple that in the middle of the inner city .
we numb vulnerability -- when we &apos;re waiting for the call .
the controversy was so heated that the red cross had to open a press conference to clarify it , and the investigation is going on .
so i thought , okay , i &apos;ll try and make an electric toaster from scratch .
i then challenged the kids to identify someone in their own life , or in their own story , or in their own world , that they could identify that had done a similar thing .
i am a vicar in the church of england .
cut to our century , same country , same pyramids , another people spreading the same idea of equality with a different book .
and just the surface appearance are often -- like the astroturf here -- they make me wince .
oh , let &apos;s see here .
now , this has all these benefits : it &apos;s very beneficial in terms of the efficiency of communicating information ; it gives you access to a whole host of people ; it allows people to coordinate their activities in very good ways .
that leads to bad things , like rsi .
and i think that is an expansion of your moral compass when you manage to do that .
but my story that i would like to share with you today is the one about success .
thank you very much .
and growing up as we have , and holding very high the value of free speech , this is a hard thing for us to accept -- for all of us to accept .
i sometimes see when i &apos;m speaking to a congregation of religious people a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces because people often want to be right instead .
and he said , &quot; i grew the worst mustache ever . &quot;
that prisoner covered himself with shit every day , and they used to have to roll him in dirt so he wouldn &apos;t stink .
i said , &quot; well i will make a research about how islam actually came to be what it is today , and what roads were taken and what roads could have been taken . &quot;
america has now elected its first openly black president .
secondly , think about this .
we might divide it -- the plumber would say , &quot; well , where &apos;s the water ? &quot;
one of the things that &apos;s very frustrating about this is that we know , by getting modern neonatal incubators into any context , if we can keep premature babies warm , basically -- it &apos;s very simple -- we can halve infant mortality rates in those environments .
but in the computational universe , we &apos;ve now seen how rules that are incredibly simple can produce incredibly rich and complex behavior .
how are you going to scale ?
and i had snuck in this article on these things called carbon nanotubes , and that &apos;s just a long , thin pipe of carbon that &apos;s an atom thick and one 50 thousandth the diameter of your hair .
the flat sharp edges are like knife blades .
and i will now , here , onstage , try to predict when that will happen -- that asia will regain its dominant position as the leading part of the world , as it used to be , over thousands of years .
jonathan zittrain : the web as random acts of kindness
one of them happened to be me now .
in the united states , there are 60,000 people who have a pacemaker that connects to the internet .
we &apos;re now moving into east africa .
and the first mate takes a rope and ties odysseus to the mast in a nice knot .
how long have we been divergent from each other ?
julia bacha : pay attention to nonviolence
malcolm mclean was moving from one country to another and was wondering why it took these guys so long to get the boxes onto the ship .
we know why these scripts are there .
and i could be wrong , i don &apos;t know , but i wish you would come tomorrow . &quot;
and this is the earliest data that i can find .
and this is , i think , the predicament of our lives : that we don &apos;t take every opportunity to help because our focus is in the wrong direction .
the first was that these were no longer just temporary hits that the recession was giving men -- that this was reflecting a deeper underlying shift in our global economy .
it was not christmas time . there was a christmas tree .
so , this is a six-shot sequence .
reduce occurrence of cancer by a drug that doesn &apos;t even touch the cancer .
from the simplest version in nature , one branch , my engineering collaborator , ron fearing , at berkeley , had made the first synthetic version .
so just imagine : one day very soon , you &apos;re going to be able to plan a trip downtown and your car will be connected to a smart parking system .
rb : no , i mean , i think i learned early on that if you can run one company , you can really run any companies .
the digital highway would follow the rutted trail first blazed by alexander graham bell .
and we don &apos;t understand why they won &apos;t let us in . right ?
stefan wolff : the path to ending ethnic conflicts
so over the next couple of years , students and i worked to develop a process .
i traveled around the world , entered different cultures , wrote a series of books about my travels , including &quot; walking the bible . &quot;
now , look at the guy .
the first occurred because the dodgers &apos; catcher , roy campanella , came to my hometown of rockville centre , long island , just as i was in preparation for my first holy communion .
and there &apos;s a reason for that : we want to settle on an answer .
it was hard , it was a difficult road , but ultimately the leaders of the community came together , realizing we only have each other .
so we must solve this problem in order to become a space-faring civilization .
why ?
they have launched a divestment campaign that has now convinced , i think , 55 universities in 22 states to divest their holdings of stocks with regard to companies doing business in sudan .
here i am now , if this is the end ? thank you .
instead of taking off , she falls back , and she grabs paula radcliffe , says , &quot; come on . come with us . you can do it . &quot;
so that , this belief in each other , knowing that without a doubt and practicing that every day in whatever you do , that &apos;s what i believe will change the world and make tomorrow better than today .
but if you search for a stock photo of diarrhea in a leading photo image agency , this is the picture that you come up with .
there &apos;s no emotional reaction to his mother , because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut .
it has an amount of impact on the planet that &apos;s measurable .
its changes will affect all of humanity .
this has really invigorated me day-to-day , when i wake up , to try and do something interesting with my day .
while you &apos;re waiting around for your nuclear , you have to run the regular electric power grid , which is mostly coal in the united states and around the world .
we made it all freely available on the web , just to -- it was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause .
we gave the world the chemical identity of this molecule , typically a secret in our discipline .
never before has creativity of the millions been as effectively displaced , and displaced because of these , quote , &quot; infernal machines . &quot;
and i really hope that this will happen .
susan parks of penn state has actually studied this .
i did not choose to take up the pen , the brush , the camera .
and this is the opening day at the library of alexandria , the new library of alexandria , in egypt .
it &apos;s thousands of times , maybe 3,000 times tougher than this .
and this is my favorite one . my mother used to say to me , &quot; just because your sister jumps in the lake doesn &apos;t mean you have to . &quot;
what do you think i &apos;m looking at ?
it was senator obama when they created it . they changed the name later .
and i remember at the beginning of my career , again and again , on these dismal outings with orchestras , i would be going completely insane on the podium , trying to engender a small scale crescendo really , just a little upsurge in volume .
of course i can use this power for example for nice spinning -- we call it &quot; helicopter moves . &quot;
maybe i can add quickly this way .
so the monkeys get really good at this .
and pretty soon we were seeing sights like this .
there &apos;s going to be a lot of people .
so we were inspired by the oyster , but i was also inspired by the life cycle of the oyster .
i went to talk to them about certain of the great tragedies of western art .
i &apos;m extremely excited to be given the opportunity to come and speak to you today about what i consider to be the biggest stunt on earth .
it &apos;ll approximate that shape . we do this for real in the test tube .
that its transition from being something that we extract and derive from the world to something that actually starts to shape it -- the world around us and the world inside us .
other studies have shown that boosting oxytocin increases envy . it increases gloating .
but today , the way i want you to understand a black hole , for the proof of a black hole , is to think of it as an object whose mass is confined to zero volume .
and then the most complex are the solid organs .
and doing on titan what rain does on the earth : it carves gullies ; it forms rivers and cataracts ; it can create canyons ; it can pool in large basins and craters .
and so , for example , there is in texting a convention , which is lol .
not even the guys at tesla can fight that physics .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s that bad of a deal .
they get there and they realize it &apos;s fashionable now to have dogs a third as tall as your ceiling heights .
nell is interested in agricultural processes , and her work is based in these practices .
so the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do what we want him to do , and this is very easy .
he &apos;s basically worked the cost to puma .
so now -- -- thank you .
in a classroom with a reverberation time of 1.2 seconds , which is pretty common , this is what it sounds like .
these are both real objects .
and then , also , was working with broad strategies .
so i classify the people into three : uneducated , little educated , surplus educated .
i asked her what that meant , and she said , &quot; miss , it &apos;s kind of a long story . &quot;
and just as i was having that thought , he looked up at me and said , &quot; so that when i grow up , i can show this to my kids ? &quot;
each rung contains information .
and i kind of got a handle on it .
the last article is an article entitled &quot; no new frontiers . &quot;
this was going to be used as a touchstone so when they started to miss each other and feel disconnected , they could reconnect through this image .
amazing how many successful couch surfings there have been .
but a million a month in laptop-land is a big number .
and what if we go back beyond that single ancestor , when there was presumably a competition among many languages ?
here &apos;s what he wrote in starting that out .
it also says a whole lot of things about what mathematicians thought mathematics was , what they thought it could and couldn &apos;t do , what they thought it could and couldn &apos;t represent .
this was the pre-bureaucratic age , an age in which everything had to be local .
now recently , there &apos;s been development in this field .
orbital hotels to start with , but workshops for the rest of us later on .
i see hope . i see happiness in their faces .
and then some of the designs that people do they actually sell in the store .
the problem with ecosystems is that we understand them so poorly , that we don &apos;t know they &apos;re really in trouble until it &apos;s almost too late .
thank you .
you find them in all places in society .
social learning really is visual theft .
so , i came to give you a ride . &quot;
it has wonderful properties .
we started out with model airplane paint and then we found these wonderful little japanese markers , and they work really well .
and this is the most powerful light source in the solar system .
voice 1 : you &apos;ll have to stay here in the safe house until we get word the terrorist threat is over .
and you need a strong government to do that , because you cannot respect private property rights .
actually , she had never been to school , not to a lick , one day .
now my company , fark , deals with news , ostensibly , and as a result we were not in violation of this patent .
and as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear -- and we might be in range of doing something about aging -- this becomes part of the problem .
other organizations send volunteers .
so , what &apos;s needed now is to rebuild these boundaries .
&quot; but what if i saw them ? you know , couldn &apos;t we stay together ? &quot; &quot; no . &quot;
see , starbucks you awake , we keep you awake and alive .
and she goes , &quot; then how do they get fertilized ? &quot;
they started using linkedin and flickr and gmail and google maps , all these things .
so me talking about emotion is like gandhi talking about gluttony , but it is the central organizing process of the way we think .
and they told us one important thing : &quot; you shall not beta-test . &quot;
and there &apos;s actually an instruction on the punch card which says &quot; ring the bell . &quot; so you can imagine this &quot; ting ! &quot;
so , i began , early on , competing against the other kids , seeing how long i could stay underwater while they went up and down to breathe , you know , five times , while i stayed under on one breath .
and this change in thinking of human capital is linked to the fact that india is going through a demographic dividend .
but that &apos;s not all what we need to do . we need to use active systems .
certain subjects came up over and over : how much money they made , what kind of husband they hoped to marry , whether they should jump to another factory or stay where they were .
so i really hope our global audiences can relate .
so , i didn &apos;t do that . but design matters for a number of reasons .
you lose the institutional imperative .
i hope nobody finds that offensive .
the reason for this is incentives .
the small idea is , let &apos;s all of us engage more with this in the way that jason has illustrated .
well , if we &apos;re going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of millennium development goals that we &apos;re set as a world , we need to learn from the innovators , and those innovators come from every single sector .
we know what they are .
very good , us humans ! we &apos;re catching up with the computers .
i &apos;m going to divert and talk about bananas and chocolate .
so you can imagine the scale of this problem .
and hopefully we can show the audience now how it is you do what you do .
i &apos;m a convict ; i am branded &apos; wrong . &apos; what are you going to tell me about right and wrong ? &quot;
for the first time , media is natively good at supporting these kinds of conversations .
and a very important piece of research came out on friday from the institute of health metrics and evaluation in seattle showing that almost 50 percent of the fall in child mortality can be attributed to female education .
at the time my patient posed this question to me , breast density was an obscure topic in the radiology literature , and very few women having mammograms , or the physicians ordering them , knew about this .
in reality , it does not really make you safer .
but here &apos;s what we can say : what &apos;s natural in the last thousand years is that the planet was cooling down .
and in fact , if this is what coding is like , it will only be a narrow sub-community of people with special mathematical skills and technological background that can code .
so human history is viewed as sort of this downhill slide from the good old days .
i have been blown away by this conference , and i want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what i had to say the other night .
on the outside it looks like a very typical garage , a nice garage .
because we found that the relationship between the size of the brain and its number of neurons could be described mathematically , we could calculate what a human brain would look like if it was made like a rodent brain .
we feel so nice that our children can teach us how to read and write .
so i salute each of you and your stellar achievements .
here they go out of their regular , just to be part of that , to become part of the orchestra , and that &apos;s great .
so , i don &apos;t know , just stick with me . right ?
and what &apos;s been taking up the slack in the last few decades ?
but i have to get serious . and how do you get serious ?
that &apos;s what my mother in iraq used to tell me .
it &apos;s a very challenging task . but more to come later .
we &apos;ll look at ocean warming .
does it matter to the foragers what the nest maintenance workers are doing ?
thanks very much for your attention .
politeness is a much-overlooked virtue .
take some time to rest and think about things .
in a world with no systems , with chaos , everything becomes a guerilla struggle , and this predictability is not there .
airs were played in europe at burials , as a body was carried out from the wake site to the burial site , the procession was led by a piper or a fiddle player .
1996 : less than one million new university students in china per year ; 2006 : over five million .
i think it will be quite a challenge for me .
but i would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time .
but there &apos;s still a lot of unfinished business .
here we are on october the 19th .
they go in , and they might be working with a high school student actually working on a novel -- because we had very gifted kids , too .
a few years before he died , after he had resumed writing poetry , but in secret , he confessed to a friend in a letter that i found when i was doing my research : &quot; i &apos;ve written a verse .
that &apos;s what he was doing , propping up the bed because the bed simply didn &apos;t work .
i study this .
i wanted to know if what we human beings see and hear and think is a full and accurate picture of reality .
so if you cut open a little dinosaur , it &apos;s very spongy inside like a.
and then they had to figure out : &quot; well she needs furniture .
hans rosling &apos;s new insights on poverty
and believe it or not , you don &apos;t win juggling champions for doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups .
it &apos;s an antidote to the growing tendency we have to feel that we can really ever experience life by watching it on a computer screen , you know , when we &apos;re in a wi-fi zone .
and by the time i was an intern house officer , i could barely afford to maintain my mother &apos;s 13-year-old car -- and i was a paid doctor .
to those to whom it doesn &apos;t happen , there will be adversities .
i literally couldn &apos;t point to any physical construction .
he does , though , have a little bit of light down in the south that has a very special status .
we now call them non-avian dinosaurs and avian dinosaurs .
and again , it &apos;s fully interactive , so you can rotate and you can look at things in real time on these systems here .
the third lesson we learned is that policy matters . it really matters .
as i said , they were adventurous people .
because all businesses are man-made objects ; all business is involved with money ; all business is a matter of using machinery , and all those things make something inauthentic .
at that point , i became a little more ambitious and decided to see what else could children do with a computer .
and this is how they see the world .
you can &apos;t focus on what you &apos;re supposed to do .
but in the blind taste test , it came in last .
so , why doesn &apos;t it do it ?
so this was before the computer was invented .
that took me to this wet and warm band of the tropics that encircles the earth .
we all have done it , leaving the area because the sound in there is so dreadful .
and it means that you now eat products , which can come from all around the world .
it was so overwhelming , because the amount of things you have to do , it &apos;s just mind-boggling .
so , playing with fire .
and that is what origami used to be .
as a clergyman , you can imagine how out of place i feel .
same strategy .
but it depends not on chance , but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time .
think about it . really bring it to mind . this is important .
i have no interest in being in media business .
they still have an apple left .
here is a lump of flesh , about three pounds , which you can hold in the palm of your hand .
and watch her make eye contact with them right about now .
crime did fall .
that said , it &apos;s been really hard to ignore football for the last couple of weeks .
you all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades or of flipping a heads .
and so we retrofit these with sensors and processors , and these robots can fly indoors without gps .
the patient or spouse agrees not to file a lawsuit if one of the known procedure failures occurs .
it &apos;s way more energetic .
they then move out to the next one , and in the course of just a few weeks , the grass just enters this blaze of growth .
and we look at these exponential technologies from medicine , biotech , artificial intelligence , robotics , nanotechnology , space , and address how can we cross-train and leverage these to impact major unmet goals .
so actually , now the temes are forcing our brains to become more like teme machines .
but fortunately for the world , he did not have to pass an english test .
i didn &apos;t know where i was going , where i &apos;d come from , and i panicked . i had a total anxiety attack .
and the idea , their premise was that we wanted to show pieces of sculpture on the street , and there &apos;d be no subjective decision about what was the best .
they found clever ways to trade items and to sell their accounts to each other so that they could make money while they were playing their games .
ks : thank you .
how do we explore intelligence in this animal that &apos;s so different from us ?
the brain is removed from the skull , and then it &apos;s sliced into one-centimeter slices .
and if you look at it over here , the main thing i wrote on my thumb was the future .
is it worth it to you ?
this is just the food chain unfolding .
i have no more reason to blame myself .
and third , they &apos;re all attracted to each other , but they try to keep a small distance apart .
i think it &apos;s a problem of completion and delivery , because the fine print said , &quot; what game-changing ideas and scientific developments would you expect to live to see ? &quot;
this has never made much sense to me , this argument .
but of course , that only works when we have both of these components .
so i left work an hour early that afternoon and picked harry up at the school gates .
a human child is born , and for quite a long time is a consumer .
same pattern .
sadly , it &apos;s metaphorically true .
so , turning on a wave bubble might not just cause inconvenience .
and if we think of that -- let me put the picture up -- the fibers represent vulnerability .
so they shipped me off to the army , and lo and behold , many years later , i &apos;m considered one of the greatest sons the city college of new york has ever had .
he finds a local sporting team .
and during the evolution of life on the earth , it was the colonization of the land by plants that helped create the benign climate we currently enjoy .
do you know where your grandparents were born ?
another three years , no vision . he leaves again .
now giving the polio vaccine is simple .
but the next step is called &quot; universal responsibility . &quot;
now , in aberdeen , i started my dermatology training .
it &apos;s a precise specification with a precise formal language that causes mathematica to know what to do here .
it &apos;s got a remarkably clear yes / no answer , and just requires phenomenal grunt .
it is not my decision . my job is to make sure that every person , no matter what fate has assigned to you , will have the opportunity to get the best quality health care in life .
and a lot of my experiences resemble mirrors in some way .
thank you .
what has changed is how people respond to vague questions .
so , why aren &apos;t governments blaring this on television ?
she stayed at the top of her class through elementary school , middle school , she scored brilliantly on the national examinations so that she became the first person in her village , ever , to come to the united states on scholarship .
population growth will mainly occur among the poorest people here because they have high child mortality and they have many children per woman .
they want to , as jimmy said , they want to have a dialogue , a conversation .
i think we call it restorative seafood .
even in the oceans , we are creating a lot of light that we could actually ban also for animal life to have a much greater well-being .
regina dugan : from mach-20 glider to hummingbird drone
instead of going around the world and haranguing countries for engaging with china , the west should be encouraging its own businesses to trade and invest in these regions .
and in interactions with people , almost all the time , it is this kind of flexibility that is required .
when you &apos;re totally in the moment , when i &apos;m totally in the moment , the vessel of expression is open .
so , a problem in explaining how children learn language , a problem in teaching language to adults so that they don &apos;t make grammatical errors , and a problem in programming computers to use language is which verbs go in which constructions .
why do teenagers seem so much more impulsive , so much less self-aware than grown-ups ? cognitive neuroscientist sarah-jayne blakemore compares the prefrontal cortex in adolescents to that of adults , to show us how typically &quot; teenage &quot; behavior is caused by the growing and developing brain .
but in &apos; 96 they heard a few weird songs , and it turned out that these strange songs were typical of west coast whales .
that &apos;s much more important than running anti-viruses or running firewalls .
dh : so richard , what were we on the list ? like 1,020 ?
and it should come as no surprise that my first novel at 16 was about neo-nazis taking over nigeria to institute the fourth reich .
or , sometimes i take them to places that people have never heard of because they &apos;re underwater .
and my mind started racing , &quot; puerto rico ? what do i know about puerto rico ? &quot;
they thought you just wear out , there &apos;s nothing you can do about it -- kind of like an old shoe .
we &apos;ve now formed a company called amyris , and this technology that they &apos;re using can be used to make better biofuels .
it was an absolutely amazing experience .
we &apos;d like to tell our story better , and engage young people , and thereby change their perspective .
of course you need to be in physical , very good , condition , so i &apos;m training a lot .
and get this -- you &apos;ll have an eight-week vacation of doing absolutely nothing .
but soon we may see polio eradicated .
and then you have the emerging world cities , with a mixed variety of vehicles , mixed land-use patterns , also rather dispersed but often with a very dense urban core .
right there .
you will never be as young as you are right now .
it was surprisingly non-innovative , moved very slowly , but then there was just so much fiber out there , you couldn &apos;t hold back , and look how quickly the price fell .
that &apos;s what happens .
the first five days after the train crash , there were 10 million criticisms of the posting on social media , which never happened in chinese history .
baby shannon -- you can see her on the left -- is doing much better now , and ryan got a job by taking some of our courses .
&quot; that crazy woman . she &apos;s off again . she &apos;ll say anything won &apos;t she ? &quot;
and then my university education as an ecologist reinforced my beliefs .
we &apos;re trying to struggle to find our identity .
and so it &apos;s perfect for something like that .
so , we began through our nonprofit institute &apos;s training hospitals around the country , and we found that most people could avoid surgery , and not only was it medically effective , it was also cost effective .
to make the story short , here is the coverage of the country .
there are 12 pairs of 50 : 1 reductions , so that means that the final speed of that gear on the end is so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once .
and meditation or self-inspection is one of the ways -- again it &apos;s not the only one -- it &apos;s one of the ways of gaining this kind of inner power .
and this is after two years .
they said , &quot; you know , when do you want to come out ? &quot;
now , the question is , &quot; when will the catch up take place ? &quot;
they &apos;re looking at the really little stuff that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff .
and when i would feel sorry for myself as nine or 10 year-old girls do , she would say to me , &quot; my dear , on a scale of major world tragedies , yours is not a three . &quot;
dna is a very elegant molecule .
those of you from north america will be familiar with the monarch butterfly .
but then , i just thought that this human vision wasn &apos;t good enough .
now i see some puzzled looks like , &quot; why are you asking us what &apos;s the right thing to do ?
things are bad enough as they are . &quot;
and so , whereas dr. oliver sacks has talked about how perhaps one person in a million actually has true synesthesia , where they hear colors or taste shapes , and things like this , phonaesthesia is something we can all experience to some extent .
the problem lies with us : we &apos;ve become addicted to experts .
that &apos;s great .
so , you might be wondering , well , how do they do it ?
we have an awful , awful reality right now .
and yet we still insist , by and large , in thinking that we can understand china by simply drawing on western experience , looking at it through western eyes , using western concepts .
eight , nine , 10 .
and in that moment i understood that everything i had gone to thailand to look for , to search for , i had it already in my singing -- the calm , but alertness , the focus , but awareness , and being totally in the moment .
yay !
there &apos;s no working for each other across the colonies .
and everybody says -- i say -- it &apos;s an education project .
but , somehow , none of that adds up to me , to what i think india really can aim to contribute in the world , in this part of the 21st century .
you get up , it flushes by itself .
what you &apos;ve heard is true .
because they had banker hours basically .
culturomics is similar .

i stepped from my car and said &quot; shalom , &quot; and identified myself , and she told me that her husband abed would be home from work in four hours .
they believe juniper smoke is holy .
but this one was made out of a nylon tag out of my shirt .
the lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles -- a car approaching from the front , the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads , any obstacles around the vehicle .
and there &apos;s a lot of evidence that neural activity can cause your connections to change .
it &apos;s what we &apos;re going to use in the future .
let me now turn to the last project , which involves the national beverage of scotland .
so we really want to build a robot that anyone can use , whether you &apos;re eight or 80 .
it was central planning by mao tse tung .
and making sense of the financial crisis is very , very difficult .
now we knew , when we built this system , the whole point of it , just like with the palm pilots , was that you &apos;d have to , you &apos;d be able to collect the data and immediately upload the data and get your data set .
many of us have a social media presence -- a virtual personality made up of status updates , tweets and connections , stored in the cloud . adam ostrow asks a big question : what happens to that personality after you &apos;ve died ? could it ... live on ?
and roots and shoots is a program for hope .
and these are the types of animals that live in that three-dimensional space , that micro-gravity environment that we really haven &apos;t explored .
it would have the global reach of the world economic forum .
if it &apos;s very good , it &apos;s not going to work , because no one &apos;s going to notice it .
why else would we still be here ?
it &apos;s a means to an end , not an end in itself , and automation allows us to have that machinery .
we don &apos;t know where the structure is .
our school would show bill nye the science guy .
i don &apos;t think so . not a chance . but then , how on earth is it done ?
when you have 20 people and you are the one who has to decide ...
we need to get away from feeling , in the same way , human rights matters because of the other things it brings , or women &apos;s rights matters for the other things it brings .
and the consequence of cheap phone calling , free phone calling , to india , is the pissed-off programmer , is the outsourcing .
their usefulness varies and contributes to variation in the society &apos;s treatment of the elderly .
almost everybody knows this , from nobel laureates to golf caddies , or was taught it , as i was .
and you &apos;ll see why 1984 won &apos;t be like &quot; 1984 . &quot;
here &apos;s another quiz for you -- now suppose we &apos;ve got a test for a disease which isn &apos;t infallible , but it &apos;s pretty good .
in hospitals , they are security issues .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit more .
bb : there were many changes ...
we were in la zouche .
we tried in the water without any skin or ballast just to see how it works .
you could take that money and buy your banjo .
a guy named jeff brinker has found a way to have a self-assembling coding process .
ks : so that was the six we had for you today , but i hope you &apos;re starting to see why we find these things so fascinating .
what &apos;s going to happen to you between this point and that point ?
how can that not make you feel optimistic for the future ?
if anyone wants to try and play drums , then they can .
we saw geysers coming out .
this is why we have to solve our problems , and i know the answer as to how is to be able to get exquisite control over a building block of nature , the stuff of life : the simple electron .
we implemented this checklist in eight hospitals around the world , deliberately in places from rural tanzania to the university of washington in seattle .
so life was much more creative than we had ever thought .
you know , cameron sinclair yesterday said , &quot; how do i get everyone to collaborate on design globally to do housing for humanity ? &quot;
she calculated the up-front cost and the payback over time , and it &apos;s a net-plus on so many levels for the local , national and global economy .
this message is given as a public service .
and after i &apos;ve actually sculpted them , i have to paint them .
and i couldn &apos;t wait to get into the dark in the middle of the night , because that &apos;s when neil young comes out .
this is a physics and information theory term .
so what we &apos;re doing at the moment like calcium , potassium and magnesium from out of desalination brine .
it was that the nobel prize was the tombstone on all great work , and it resonated because i had won 35 out of 36 contests that i &apos;d entered over 11 years , and it made me bananas .
and behavior like this from janitors , from technicians , from nurses and , if we &apos;re lucky now and then , from doctors , doesn &apos;t just make people feel a little better , it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well .
so it &apos;s almost like fossils for the future .
this is a little plot , and every time you show a plot , you lose 10 percent of the audience .
this is something they can use instead of a firearm in those situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone . &quot;
i mean , it &apos;s not easy ; you see a lot of poverty .
the first embrace is something that we think , &quot; oh , this is very easy , &quot; but it &apos;s actually getting harder , and that &apos;s paying attention to the world around us .
you can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately .
boy : this one lighted up , and this one nothing .
it &apos;s not about genes .
every time you think of a city , you &apos;ve got to think green .
and these are my parents .
so that , very much , is in the realm of things i &apos;ve been interested in before .
with your eyes closed , what am i wearing ?
so i said okay .
it &apos;s a stronger risk factor than having a mother or a sister with breast cancer .
they wanted to replace scripture with culture .
so it seems that the only trait that survives decapitation is vanity .
they were spirited to safety . they were reclassified as yugoslav citizens and they managed to stay one step ahead of their pursuers for the duration of the war , surviving burnings and bombings and , at the end of the war , arrest by the soviets .
that &apos;s this line here , growing in power , these are what the iranians call the quietists .
and you can have anything in that room , anything you want , but you can &apos;t see anything .
so the question is : what are we doing ?
we rescued over 550 dancing bears .
you don &apos;t have to burn any incense , and you definitely don &apos;t have to sit on the floor .
well , from there , unfortunately , in 2004 , the project came to a halt . many political reasons .
and many of you were doing what great , if you will , tribal leaders do , which is to find someone who is a member of a tribe , and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe , and make introductions .
&quot; so are you carrying a needle ? &quot;
well , we did that 10 years ago .
and the brahmins and the gods , like in my story , always get to tell their truth as the truth .
the united states has to access that battle space instantaneously .
and it &apos;s kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse , except that you &apos;re now running a string of these things down .
the family &apos;s obese .
the broad consensus in neuroscience is that we can &apos;t yet diagnose mental illness from a single brain scan .
for some magicians or mentalists , sometimes the spoon will bend or melt , sometimes it will not .
he &apos;s going to pick up a grape -- he didn &apos;t drop it , he didn &apos;t break it -- and he &apos;s going to eat it .
ss : this is kanzi and i , in the forest .
i &apos;m here today to offer you that new model .
this is one such volunteer , and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked .
i knew this was happening . i knew the artic was warming .
dead easy to give him respect .
people weren &apos;t aware they could have that .
college graduates are not in short supply .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;ll affect the adults .
so it &apos;s extremely unfair towards the poor .
i think that is too simplistic .
you know what the clinching evidence was that space-time is curved ?
zk : our next technology comes to us from a company in japan called sekisui chemical . one of their r &amp; amp ; d engineers was working on a way to make plastic stiffer .
i was especially concerned of what the girls might think .
you have youtube , we have youku and tudou .
she had two sponges in her hand , and then she had two tied to her knees . my mother was completely absorbent .
when these things die , immediately , organisms come in and encrust and live on that dead surface .
so now imagine that i give each and every one of you 2,000 dollars -- 20 crisp hundred dollar bills .
and when you clean a penguin , you first have to spray it with a degreaser .
and we read every once in while about these crazy lawsuits , like the guy in the district of columbia who sued his dry cleaners for 54 million dollars because they lost his pair of pants .
but others turned this issue on its head , taking us to the possibility of a multiverse .
by laying fallow , i planted the seeds for a healthier future and was reunited with the ones i love .
driving them home , and they want them to be enlightened , so they take them to ben &amp; amp ; jerry &apos;s ice cream company with its own foreign policy .
and if we can catalyze a supportive community to come around these individuals and to participate in their story by lending a little bit of money , i think that can change the way we believe in each other and each other &apos;s potential .
here &apos;s my brain .
here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation .
but it &apos;s a hard process to do because , as you know , the middle of a star is quite hot , almost by definition .
you can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our technical capabilities improve .
like this .
it &apos;s that people start to say , &quot; when i really want to get stuff done , i go to the office . &quot;
here is another example of something which is -- this is a little spectrophotometer .
yeah , it &apos;s a fabulous movie if you haven &apos;t seen it .
they were in perfect condition , very fat and healthy , robust , no entanglement scars , the way they &apos;re supposed to look .
and there is some truth to this , in the sense that we have something of a finite resource , and increased growth is going to push up demand for that .
this here shows , on the y-axis , the increase in the probability that a person is obese given that a social contact of theirs is obese and , on the x-axis , the degrees of separation between the two people .
here &apos;s how the game is played : there are two players ; they &apos;ve never played the game before , they will not play the game again , they don &apos;t know each other , and they are , in fact , in separate rooms .
i dream of a wikipedia-like website that would explain any scientific concept you can think of in simple language any middle schooler can understand .
so , the fourth sort of post-crisis consumerism that we see is this movement about return to the fold .
and he says , &quot; osha ? ocean . &quot;
here &apos;s a really cool problem . i like this .
no , it looks like a mess . it looks like a mess with a guy there , who &apos;s got his hands around that mess , ok .
or the bobcat , needing rabbits and beavers and den sites .
and nowhere does the quality of an education system exceed the quality of its teachers .
this guy &apos;s measuring the water that this leaves in the stream .
thank you .
what if you could find out that , using the dna in museum specimens , fossils maybe up to 200,000 years old could be used to bring species back , what would you do ? where would you start ?
so , you might be wondering why it is that , every time we have high oil prices or an oil spill , we call these ceos down to washington , and we sort of pepper them with questions in public and we try to shame them .
so if we were to do that , what might sitopia look like ?
and they &apos;re not in too many zoos , because of their sexual behavior .
it landed on the surface . this is pictures taken on the way down .
it &apos;s been very confusing for a long time now .
remember , that &apos;s a short time .
gods we &apos;re still fighting about . oh yeah .
csi : climate .
like my next link , the almost irresistible link , ham the astrochimp .
we &apos;re not talking sport today .
but anyway , for some reason , i promised myself that i wasn &apos;t going to move , that i was going to do this thing that mummy wanted me to do .
i did so for a simple reason .
now i can divide my spoken word journey into three steps .
we need to bring health and food and education and respect for all god &apos;s citizens , all god &apos;s children , remembering mama eternal .
wk : this is my parents , holding the radio .
tremendous and beautiful discovery .
i started the program in capetown , south africa back in 2001 .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction , meaning you &apos;re saying that that sharp inflection -- ki-ki , in your auditory cortex , the hair cells being excited -- kiki , mimics the visual inflection , sudden inflection of that jagged shape .
it &apos;s got little dressing rooms and cabanas , where lots of interesting things went on , all summer long .
every red blood cell of your body right now has these hourglass-shaped pores called aquaporins .
uganda has 961 sub-counties , each of them with a dispensary , none of which has an ambulance .
you know , let &apos;s just make an educated guess , and they simply point and they go for 10 percent , right in the middle .
see , people who build world-changing tribes do that .
these animals and their demise occurs in the tuna fisheries .
all right , now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate .
she was chewing betel nut , which caused her teeth over the years to turn very red .
and it doesn &apos;t matter to me whether you &apos;re running a coffee shop or you &apos;re an intellectual , or you &apos;re in business , or you &apos;re flying hot air balloons .
as long as our books are written in english -- because people are rewriting them and recopying them -- it &apos;s going to be there .
islam actually , as a monotheistic religion , which defined man as a responsible agent by itself , created the idea of the individual in the middle east and saved it from the communitarianism , the collectivism of the tribe .
look in the gray areas , and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there -- yeah , it &apos;s amazing . there &apos;s nothing there . it &apos;s no trick .
i think it &apos;s because there &apos;s an imbalance , an asymmetry , in the way we treat creative , emotionally-driven psychological ideas versus the way we treat rational , numerical , spreadsheet-driven ideas .
and the pipa trust board holds that license and pays the country for this .
but it turned out it wasn &apos;t going to be as simple in the end , and it set us back three months because we had one error out of over a million base pairs in that sequence .
i told the priest right away .
and he invited us in particular because we have a very specific type of design process -- one that results in appropriate design solutions in places that don &apos;t usually have access to design services or creative capital .
that &apos;s all it takes , six-and-a-half grand per school .
lighting the merchandise and creating accents that help you to get around .
that &apos;s also an insult to history .
it &apos;s great that we have initiatives to say , let &apos;s go create the education and educate people in the world , because that &apos;s a great force for peace .
there were just bad for me .
i &apos;ve tried to look at the risks of reversion to conflict , during our post-conflict decade .
so it sort of raised more questions than it answered .
they are tested and accredited according to international mine action standards , just like dogs have to pass a test .
there &apos;s many , many more colors around us that we cannot perceive , but that electronic eyes can perceive .
so i tracked down one of the folks who makes these things , this guy in mali just outside of bamako , and i asked him , &quot; how come you &apos;re making fractal fences ? because nobody else is . &quot;
one nation , one system .
but the goal is to go much further and , very broadly , to democratize all of this knowledge , and to try and be an authoritative source in all areas .
six hundred degree f water coming out of the earth .
and my question is , how did we get from there to here ?
matthieu &apos;s own experience is that compassion is the happiest state ever .
this is really unpleasant stuff , and if it was any good , we wouldn &apos;t have this massive increase in mosquitos and we wouldn &apos;t have this massive increase in dengue fever .
before the light bulb was invented , people had figured out how to put a reflector behind it , focus it a little bit ; put lenses in front of it , focus it a little bit better .
and even though they &apos;re used in labs to promote human lives , they &apos;re also considered pests .
see , if i did it slowly , it &apos;d be back on your shoulder .
so i did the only thing my little frantic seven year-old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy .
either way , they present us with a huge moral and ethical dilemma .
and the reason it shouldn &apos;t be is that on any day you can go into trending topics .
and then the clouds came over us , and then , boom ! this massive thunderclap , and sheets of rain .
and again , he said , &quot; this painting of me with my son jeremiah shows me as the successful man that i feel that i am . &quot;
but we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands .
this seems more acceptable , but it still leaves god with the ultimate moral responsibility .
polar bears are amazing hunters .
actually you don &apos;t .
well , a poor understanding .
and if people are migrating into urban , unfamiliar , concrete environments , they can also be helped in anticipation with social supporters ready and waiting for them based on sms knowledge .
em : no , we don &apos;t patent . you didn &apos;t patent because you think it &apos;s more dangerous to patent than not to patent .
this is a river .
and our job is to convince the authorities that these forests have to be protected .
and the issue in africa is that there are fewer nurses , really than doctors , and so we need to find new paradigm for health care .
that shallow history shouldn &apos;t suggest to anyone that we have all of the answers for all of the questions that will confront us in the ensuing millennia .
we used to have to drive up a ramp , and we still do sometimes .
now , i want you to put your data on the web .
he certainly wasn &apos;t smiling when i got there , because he was somewhat humiliated by pauling getting the alpha helix , and the cambridge people failing because they weren &apos;t chemists .
rd : yeah , yeah . it did .
thelma golden : how art gives shape to cultural change
and i decided , it was an old dream that was lingering , that was from so many years ago , three decades ago -- the only sort of world class swim i had tried and failed at back in my 20s -- was going from cuba to florida .
clothed in this nylon bag , made in china , with the name of burqa .
and it led us to the project , the courthouse , which is absolutely a part of a negotiation between tradition and pieces of the traditional courthouse .
we maintain that , put that together as a project to really chart the universe across all scales .
we have problems with the tropical rains .
everybody looks at this prime minister of that country , and he says , &quot; yes . &quot;
this emerging economy really is helping the revival of the world economy .
what causes the bug ? is it the drama of the event -- that it &apos;s so spectacular ?
our intuition is really fooling us in a repeatable , predictable , consistent way .
and i can turn them all on , and you can see them moving across the sky now .
or you could spray .
and i -- you know , when i saw her , such a wonderful feeling .
i was writing a book about sustainable energy , and a friend asked me , &quot; well how much energy do you use at home ? &quot; and i was embarrassed . i didn &apos;t actually know .
but what if the option to have your car stolen was not exactly like this .
because we are counting on you .
at that point , can the child go home ?
so the project really addresses these three core issues in a new and exciting way , i think .
and you can do the same with your genes and track them back in time .
i was on bowman lake in glacier national park , which is a long , skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it , and my partner and i have a rowing shell .
it &apos;s a completely useless ability , if you think about it .
and passing her son to someone through a window .
it &apos;s a story that goes on long after his body no longer does .
dying is seen as failing , and we had a heroic narrative for fighting together , but we didn &apos;t have a heroic narrative for letting go .
everyone here cares about changing the world and has made a difference in that one way or another .
it &apos;s got the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain , where you have 100 billion neurons .
it &apos;s not like we had to find him actually killing somebody live to arrest him .
because big sisters are always supposed to support their little sisters .
anyway , i asked peter , by any chance , could he take us back to where he caught those thylacines .
every time somebody looks at you , you think people are staring at you .
so i &apos;m sorry about that .
so thinking about outcomes , it turns out appearances matter .
i learned one thing : when you walk the talk , people believe you .
the classrooms have no walls .
so we need new stories , new heroes and new tools .
and we have actually flown this vehicle and lost an engine , and continued to hover .
this is the at &amp; amp ; t performing arts center &apos;s dee and charles wyly theater .
all this field of view is a single strand of dna .
here &apos;s another case , a knifing .
to ask them to always have the right answer doesn &apos;t allow them to learn .
and perhaps this is the ultimate gift of feminism , that the personal is in fact the political .
but perhaps more than anything , what this thinking provides is a really positive way of talking about sustainable design .
no single person is really the ultimate actor behind the personality of a neighborhood .
but it turned out , after i sent the works to her , that her dad &apos;s friends , like most of you , are geeks .
so they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing .
but capitalizing on their enthusiasm , capitalizing on their energy means finishing the job that they started 20 years ago .
the rest goes to religion and higher education and hospitals and that 60 billion dollars is not nearly enough to tackle these problems .
experiments suggest that lightning could be the next gps .
a lot of reporters come to yemen and they want to write a story on al-qaeda or terrorism .
meaning white fur , ice blue eyes , a pink nose .
i didn &apos;t expect that person that i was going to meet to be him .
we could do work on the sea floor that would be stunning , and it would be on live tv , if we have interesting things to show .
it &apos;s on the x chromosome . and so in this way you can only get it from your mother .
is there a reason for this ? &quot; and a lot of the replies i got were that muscle is terminally differentiated tissue .
in this dramatically expanded ideal of a liberal arts education where the continuum of thought and action is its life &apos;s blood , knowledge honed outside the academy becomes essential .
so we measured nine other molecules that interact with oxytocin , but they didn &apos;t have any effect .
but those environments are going to be widely spaced in this universe .
but it &apos;s also very serious because all this accessibility stuff started coming up , where people can &apos;t use computers , necessarily .
i don &apos;t know , but we &apos;ll try it .
where is the small hadron collider ?
didn &apos;t go into the internet , kept his money , decided to go into computer games .
i &apos;ve had some great meals at cafeterias .
and when you kill orgasm , you kill that flood of drugs associated with attachment .
you &apos;ve obviously never opened all the toolbars , but all you have to type in is this little , teeny window down here .
i &apos;m the embodiment of all truth . &quot;
two , is other-directed : being what you say you are to others .
when that happens , you provide people with multiple ways of re-entering the world through different windows , and when you do that , it allows them to triangulate the world that they live in and see its shape .
and the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom is a fly in the middle of a sports stadium and the next atom is in the next sports stadium .
if you include all the drain , it takes more than a hundred pints of water to make a pint of beer .
and in that time she saved many girls . and when we met her we asked her what we could do for her , and she said , &quot; well , if you got me a jeep i could get around a lot faster . &quot;
but i wanted to go further than to say our brains make us moral .
we are going to merge with our technology .
when i speak at coaching clinics , i often tell young coaches -- and at coaching clinics , more or less , they &apos;ll be the younger coaches getting in the profession .
instead of doing that actually , we &apos;ve developed some fish sticks that you can feed the fish .
and in fact , because we can create spare parts with things the machines are quite literally making themselves .
i can &apos;t think of anything else that &apos;s happened in my lifetime that way .
and there are three main stages .
so you can imagine , if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting -- and he had hundreds of these stories -- you would have to relax .
so then , i ask , what &apos;s in it for you ?
these losses , they feel , emotionally , they feel very different from what we actually thought about it when markets were going up . &quot;
from lascaux to the louvre to carnegie hall , human beings have a permanent innate taste for virtuoso displays in the arts .
i only wanted data on the women who were going to be attracted to the type of man that i really , really wanted to marry .
why did she say that ?
in other words , solutions by the poor people need not be cheaper , need not be , so-called , jugaad , need not be some kind of makeshift arrangement .
first of all , ambience . i have a whole tedtalk about this .
none of these things is likely , but my , my philosophy is , look for what &apos;s detectable , not for what &apos;s probable .
you know that you can hold a 40-ounce bottle of rum and two bottles of coke in a wineskin ? so what , right ?
now as you know , a great deal of time is spent , inside the climate debate , on the question of , &quot; what if the ipc scientists are all wrong ? &quot;
the problem is enormous .
are these so bad that they outweigh condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death ?
and i &apos;d like to take you there , to that morning , for just a quick video .
go and study it . &quot;
but now with the internet , i &apos;ve just shown you a project where we &apos;ve gotten 750 million people to help us digitize human knowledge .
and oldenburg , who i work with a little once in a while , told me i couldn &apos;t do it , and so that made it even more exciting .
sometimes it &apos;s even 100 percent , much more than many privileged schools .
you have to act it out .
that was a nice thing to get .
this has huge implications .
my favorite is sophocles &apos; oedipus the king : &quot; sex with mum was blinding &quot; in a way , if you like , at one end of the spectrum of sympathy , you &apos;ve got the tabloid newspaper .
i &apos;m going to do some cuts .
down here in this little corner , here , we have the little sub-space of this larger space that is accessible to human beings -- beings with our biological capacities .
linda , my wife , joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals .
people are always going on about , &quot; how did september the 11th change you ? &quot;
but we all actually have the same capacity that they do , and we need to do their work now .
a haploid genome -- we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes -- a haploid genome is around 3.2 billion nucleotides in length .
so i changed the locations , and then we found the base pairing , and francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions .
i was on a three-month road trip this summer .
so you put these together . it &apos;s really hard to see how we &apos;re going to get to the rest of the century without at least doubling global agricultural production .
we are so honored to be here at tedwomen , sharing our music with you .
there &apos;s another drug out there .
it &apos;s in clothing and food and our transportation needs , our energy -- we sprawl just a little bit .
my own law firm has a list of questions that i &apos;m not allowed to ask when interviewing candidates , such as the sinister question , bulging with hidden motives and innuendo , &quot; where are you from ? &quot;
older americans are at a big disadvantage in job applications .
that agriculture will work better if there are railroads to get the goods to market .
16,000 kilometers , four generations , mind you , for a two inch long insect . it &apos;s quite incredible .
so , these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy-gurdy .
after all , they decide , and they did .
first , about a guy named nathan winograd .
but whoever decided that a chicken should look like a heart , a giraffe , a star ?
so imagine you have , say , a hoover in your home and it has broken down . you need a spare part , but you realize that hoover &apos;s been discontinued .
dh : the french judge gives it a 5.2 .
she should not go into banking , for example , or work at a cash register .
and it &apos;s almost impossible to perform .
i &apos;m going to pass it to this handsome gentleman .
so they basically put a map up on the wall , threw a dart , and it landed at a senior home here in colorado .
she was three years old and i was 15 .
but now we try to understand that in terms of the development of a part of their brain called the limbic system , so i &apos;m going to show you the limbic system in red in the slide behind me , and also on this brain .
so this is a student &apos;s opinion on what his experience of games are .
and not just in chicago , but in the entire united states .
most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food .
you know , it was going to be a nice long trip .
think about something you &apos;ve always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next 30 days .
and so they &apos;ve come up with their own set of rules , the &quot; rules of the internet . &quot;
but as a scientist , i &apos;m interested in a different problem of other minds , and that is the one i &apos;m going to introduce to you today .
it was created by scientists , but it couldn &apos;t have been created if they didn &apos;t have a printing press as a tool .
so this approach that we &apos;re taking for cancer prevention may also have an application for obesity .
and he has done path-breaking work on autism and confirmed , also for the authorities here , that gary mckinnon -- who is wanted by the united states for hacking into the pentagon -- suffers from asperger &apos;s and a secondary condition of depression .

it was so simple , in fact , that i suspect a really smart high school student , who didn &apos;t even have calculus , could understand what he wrote down .

sometimes you get a little star applause , and then i think even bill gates takes a nervous breath , and the talk begins .
thank you .
our calculation shows that quantum tunneling of the higgs field is not likely to occur in the next 10 to the 100 years , and this is a very long time .
because there &apos;s huge opportunities in that .
but i wanted to work only and truly with business and media leadership to totally reframe disability in a way that was exciting and possible .
this is the guy who started the project in my lab , and this is the guy who &apos;s been doing prostate stuff .
anybody ? all right .
it didn &apos;t make them less happy , it just didn &apos;t do much for them .
one of my colleagues in bulgaria , nevena markova , spent about 20 years studying these profiles .
here &apos;s what i was saying about the laws . they &apos;re really there .
and there are thousands of other examples of this happening -- of video-driven evolution of skills , ranging from the physical to the artful .
is this real ? does the language matter , because he &apos;s not supposed to know english ?
we looked at smoking and drinking behavior , and voting behavior , and divorce -- which can spread -- and altruism .
but the man had somehow a lot of room at the bottom .
we have fit over 5,000 amputees , and one of the big indicators we &apos;re looking at , of course , is , does it improve lives ?
from the moment that our ancestors , perhaps two and a half million years ago or so , began imitating , there was a new copying process .
again , opportunity to tackle markets to get that higher price .
i think you matter to god ; i think you matter to history ; i think you matter to this universe .
and so a plan came up to video the vote .
so in 2011 , power shifted , from the few to the many , from oval offices to central squares , from carefully guarded airwaves to open-source networks .
and when you go home , think of what you are going to change in your research on the following day to make their lives better . &quot;
so , the electromagnetic force , the force that holds us together , gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures .
what lies within us can never be truly colonized , contorted , or taken away .
i had been seduced by that potato and not another into planting its -- into spreading its genes , giving it a little bit more habitat .
and if you just look at how technology has been applied , we &apos;ve solved all the long-range , high-speed , high-volume , large-weight problems of moving things around .
sweden was like sierra leone today .
i wanted it to be something that was not addressed to them or signed by me , something that caused them to wonder what on earth this thing was .
so there were 66,000 of these .
and so she thought , well , what the heck .
you &apos;re not making news out of things falling down .
so they knew at that stage they could carry large weights .
and in the worship of my church , the most frequently used adjective about god is &quot; almighty . &quot;
and when i throw this up into the air and catch it , it has the full three-dimensional structure of the protein , all of the intricacies .
let &apos;s take a look .
so , like , ok , maybe it had to do with the patterns on the little pieces of paper -- you know , like , it was a diamond , or , you know , diagonal .
and when i looked at the sequence of the dna , and compared the sequence of jonas &apos; tumor to that of the rest of his body , i discovered that they had a completely different genetic profile .
he wanted a bigger band .
in the moment , that &apos;s what he did .
and as more of us move into cities , more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me -- it &apos;s soybean fields in mato grosso in brazil -- in order to feed us .
it was a phenomenon where young brides were committing suicide in rural gujarat , because they were being forced to bring more and more money for their in-laws &apos; families .

paul maccready : the wings could touch together on top and not break . we think .
matthieu &apos;s brain scan shows that compassion is not a chore .
and here &apos;s the simplest version in nature , and here &apos;s my collaborator ron fearing &apos;s attempt at an artificial version of this dry adhesive made from polyurethane .
you see , japan did it like that .
so hang in there , and you come up with some pretty peculiar solutions .
there &apos;s a number of mines placed blindly , and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the targets .
it sounds like it was written by an old school teacher of mine .
so we &apos;ve made a silk card with penicillin in it .
i brought it to paul maccready &apos;s company aerovironment to do a feasibility study , and they analyzed it , and came up with a lot of innovative ideas about how to propel it .
this is by jason birdsong .
this , for example , this gentleman is called joseph .

i want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight-track tape .
and he pulled it toward him , like so , and he took the knife and he put it on the tip .
harvest bombs .
and the answer i have right here in my pocket , if i get it .

bobby kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message in indianapolis .
and as an architect , i &apos;ve always found these kinds of systems very limiting , because i &apos;m not interested in ideal forms and i &apos;m not interested in optimizing to some perfect moment .
kofi annan said , &quot; this will be beneficial to my troops on the ground . &quot;
and this is the oscilloscope of the whirlwind electronic computer .
you &apos;re thinking , &quot; wikipedia doesn &apos;t say this fact . &quot;
but they &apos;re adapting quickly .
and as you can see , it &apos;s about eight inches in diameter .
so that peak expiratory flow rate , i &apos;ve entered it up into the interactive software model .
well an idea is that that strategy , that learning strategy , is an extremely powerful , great strategy for getting on in the world , but it has one big disadvantage .
i don &apos;t want to write that stuff . &quot;
it &apos;s a pathological , democracy-destroying corruption , because in any system where the members are dependent upon the tiniest fraction of us for their election , that means the tiniest number of us , the tiniest , tiniest number of us , can block reform .
theirs are actually flavored with miso and sesame paste , so they &apos;re not as sweet as our version .

so you get a big squeeze .
so i do believe that one of the defining fights of our times will be the fight for the control over personal information , the fight over whether big data will become a force for freedom , rather than a force which will hiddenly manipulate us .
and then we &apos;re off to the races , because i don &apos;t believe for a second that we have forgotten how to solve tough challenges or that we have become too apathetic or hard-hearted to even try .
because they weren &apos;t tracking where the kids were before that .
they are what i consider to be the cities of tomorrow , the new urban world .
there was an fao conference last october that was completely devoted to this .
he did this because he understands data as well as books .
they work by harnessing shoulder power .
i go in their homes . and we do this worldwide , and we follow them around town with video cameras .
literally scrambling through what &apos;s called pressure ice -- the ice had been smashed up under the pressure of the currents of the ocean , the wind and the tides .
so we took a room downstairs in the basement that had been used as sort of an abu ghraib annex .
and i have done this throughout my work .
in red , sort of below oecd average .
they were around me in three directions .
but guys , if history has taught us anything , it &apos;s that if you can imagine it , you will get there eventually .
i don &apos;t think there was ever a day where i cut hair i was nervous .
i mean , when i asked them to summarize the 10 tedtalks at the same time , some took the easy route out .
self-deception .
we especially emphasize areas of great relevance to africa &apos;s development , because , in those areas , scientists working in africa will have a competitive advantage .
or if there was a hole i &apos;d think like , oh damn , there was actually someone thought of that thought already .
that was another thing that really touched me .
but that doesn &apos;t change my belief that all of us , deep inside , here in this room and across this country , share a similar set of desires .
and with our minds we can rationalize anything .
this is not just in hebrew , by the way .
and i explained , &quot; it &apos;s a dark night and a crow is perching on a branch . &quot;
one is : you can &apos;t accommodate everybody .
many people have harmed me in my life , and i remember them all , but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with the people who &apos;ve helped me .
i really get fed up when they , you know , the teachers , especially when you get away from this part of the country , they don &apos;t know what to do with these smart kids .

and so i made a drawing with a fish , and i left japan .
this was a woman who didn &apos;t have trouble with her eyes , but the visual parts of her brain , a little tumor in the occipital cortex .
and if we don &apos;t have fire , we actually could not live .

i know the free market fundamentalists will tell you that more growth , more stuff and nine billion people going shopping is the best we can do .
it &apos;s one of the things that we don &apos;t like to think about , but the fact that religious icons and good luck charms show up on dashboards around the world betrays the fact that we know this to be true .

and it was a house where girls could run away , they could save their clitoris , they wouldn &apos;t be cut , they could go to school .
you know this , if you &apos;re doing something you love , an hour feels like five minutes .
so we are right now doing some systematic field tests to basically ascertain whether something like this actually makes sense to the asha worker .
well thank you . that shot the timing .
now , i don &apos;t know if one of the editors was a woman , but that can make the biggest differences .
i not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls like carnegie hall and kennedy center , but also hospitals , churches , prisons , and restricted facilities for leprosy patients , just to mention a few .
your google science fair champions .

losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden .
when the book became the best-selling book in the world for the last three years , i kind of had my little crisis .
except , you still may not really recognize them , and that &apos;s because we have to work in three dimensions .
but burst-pulsed sounds is a bit of a mystery .
and so we didn &apos;t build any models , and francis sort of continued to work on proteins .
looked first to the courts and the legislatures to try to get them to do something to make the system make more sense .

people like rashani zafar , who created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country , and is a real role model for women inside and outside the country .

this is the spacecraft taking nine months to get to mars .
now we are able to follow them and find out their secrets , where the babies go after they hatch , and remarkable things like this you &apos;re about to see .
it &apos;s changing our lives in so many ways , and it will continue to do that .

satellite television and the internet are informing and empowering young muslims in exciting new ways .
so , the dialogue with the local and the global , the audience as participant and player and protagonist , the innovative use of site , all of these things come to play in the amazing work of the fantastic french company royal de luxe .
the problem with that view is like asking all the winners of lotteries , &quot; have you won the lottery ? &quot;
but 99 percent of chinese microbloggers stand firmly on the embassy &apos;s side .
thank you .
luanda , it was full of land mine victims who were struggling to survive on the streets and war orphans living in sewers under the streets , and a tiny , very wealthy elite who gossiped about shopping trips to brazil and portugal .
flight pilots practice in flight simulators so that they don &apos;t make real mistakes in planes .
so , we believe that on europa there is , in fact , a deep ocean .
what that suggests is that , even in the case of hearing loss , the capacity for music remains .
she did so much . she was a playwright .
now , two weeks ago , that dream took a step forward , when the state of nevada granted google &apos;s self-driving car the very first license for an autonomous vehicle , clearly establishing that it &apos;s legal for them to test it on the roads in nevada .
and also , the easiest one was when i was doing it in form of a music .
so the question is : what are they all doing ?
and here the story is fairly simple .
but not the south africa we always talk about -- the gold , the minerals , the first world infrastructure -- a bit about the other side of it .
they claim to be psychics , or sensitives , whatever they can .

surfers , for example , know this incredibly .
these are cholera beds in haiti .
they &apos;re difficult integrals .
but for us , the rain is good .
and i said -- i got worried , i said , my god , i mean i &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body image , what about human subjects , ethics and all of that ?

they owe us , to put a food ambassador in every major supermarket .
it &apos;s this pervasiveness , combined with the centrality to what it means to be a human , the fact that we can tell the truth or make something up , that has fascinated people throughout history .

so they &apos;re spinning these tiny nano fibers of pure cellulose .
this is very early rehearsal footage , but the finished work &apos;s on tour and is actually coming through l.a. in a couple weeks .

this tree frog has toes .
this game &apos;s called &quot; spore . &quot; i &apos;ve been working on it for several years .

joshua prince-ramus : building a theater that remakes itself
i worked on this for some 14 years , and i think it helped me become a better teacher .
and the conclusion of that is that psychology and psychiatry , over the last 60 years , can actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable .
they were doing something much simpler .
so i &apos;m a social scientist by training , so why am i here today talking about smart materials ?

and , yes , they were great philanthropists .
twelve years ago , i was in the street writing my name to say , &quot; i exist . &quot;
and you can see here , as this animates over , steven &apos;s actual data against the background of all other patients , against this information .

i had them right at hand .
so mundane sounds can be really interesting if you pay attention .
it made me question and curious : how could someone actually find joy in cleaning toilets for a living ?
there &apos;s a great deal of argument about whether we , as the great nation that we are , should be the policeman of the world , the world &apos;s constabulary , but there should be virtually no argument about whether we should be the world &apos;s healer .
thank you very much . thanks .
the other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important , and so naturally , people sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities .
so i went searching when i started in this game to convince myself that there was any degree of plausibility to this whole crazy story .

here &apos;s how apple actually communicates .
put your book beneath it and you can read .
unfortunately , empirical data , good , hard stats , don &apos;t exist , and therefore to prove my point , i first of all had to find some proxy way of uncovering how much food was being wasted .
if you stop that behavior on one group that you &apos;re experimenting with , and you allow it in another group that you &apos;re experimenting with , and then you present those rats with a cat odor-saturated collar , they &apos;re hardwired to flee and hide .
we &apos;re threatened by the greatest weapon ever , and knowing a good thing when it sees it , the air force decides it needs the biggest computer ever to protect us .
and the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the end of the summer when they have built the farmers &apos; market and it &apos;s open to the public -- that &apos;s the final exam .

i travelled for a month in nepal with our good friend , matthieu ricard , and you &apos;ll remember matthieu famously said to all of us here once at ted , &quot; western science is a major response to minor needs . &quot;
for so many years we have fed on aid .

i add new images because i learn more about it every time i give it .
no , i think that &apos;s wrong .
immediate detection , immediate response .
i met a father the other day ; he looked a little crazed .
the trickster has a mind that is prepared for the unprepared .
most people are entirely unconscious of these filters .
why do we respond so much to our knowledge of where something comes from ?
the eye is still transparent and you can get light in .
and i also photographed the gift bag they gave me when i left .
and so i got interested in electronics , and you know , i studied to get my ham license . i was wiring up stuff .

now , a completely different thought .
now sometimes neuroscientists need to identify individual molecular components of neurons , molecules , rather than the entire cell .
again , gathering together farmers , gathering together stakeholders in east africa to get standards for organic produce . better prices .
somehow i ended up at the hospital .
and we can be doing it if we could just get over the fact that this little slice of things is going to be for free .

natasha told me that a lot of the kids thought she was stuck up , because they would talk to her and she wouldn &apos;t answer , and they didn &apos;t realize she didn &apos;t actually speak english very well , in the beginning .
that &apos;s our next big challenge .

and when we color-code this image , to bring out the faint light levels , we see that these jets feed a plume that , in fact , we see , in other images , goes thousands of miles into the space above enceladus .
i &apos;ve been all around the world , and there will be a thousand kids crying out your name , and it &apos;s such a weird , visceral experience .
and i know this footage isn &apos;t going to look like anything to you -- we had a crummy camera at the time -- but i was ecstatic .

evelyn glennie : well then , stop clapping . try again .
we can &apos;t hatch plans and climb that stairway of popularity , of success .
now , my brother and i had never heard anything like that in our whole lives . it was so beautiful .
and i don &apos;t have to do anything .
so , what &apos;s significant about this to me isn &apos;t that we can train crows to pick up peanuts .
it has 2,000 life cycles these days .
and i &apos;m going to kick it to keith to explain why that &apos;s important from a technical standpoint .
there are a handful that have escaped into the mainstream , the ones i &apos;ve just shown you , but every day , every month , people are producing thousands of these .
charles darwin and i and you broke off from the family tree from chimpanzees about five million years ago .
now why , steve , why do we need a revolution ?
just because people can &apos;t see us doesn &apos;t mean we &apos;re going to necessarily lie .
now as it turns out -- thank you .
i have a couple of ideas to begin with .
sayyid qutb is one of the founding fathers of fanatical islam , one of the ideologues that inspired osama bin laden .
it turns out that regular play-doh that you buy at the store conducts electricity , and high school physics teachers have used that for years .
to create is to make something that has never existed before .
the way i want to do this is to build a facility where i can study this .
what a 404 page tells you is that you fell through the cracks .
if you look at this building in chile , it &apos;s ripped in half , but it &apos;s not a pile of rubble .
but there &apos;s no way to learn to fly like a hummingbird unless you fly .
but i still think that this -- -- may be this year &apos;s version of this .
so i thought of a different way by thinking , well , the talks revolve around certain themes .
five to seven percent only are inspected -- five to seven percent .
he came up to me and said , &quot; thank you for starting movember . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know what the rules were , i &apos;m a natural born scientist , i guess , or some kind of a throwback to the 17th century , whatever .
we have art students getting together , taking old radiator parts and doing an iron-pour to make something new out of it .
now everybody agrees that thyroid cancers are sky high , and that chernobyl evacuees suffer the trauma of relocated peoples everywhere : higher levels of anxiety , depression , alcoholism , unemployment and , importantly , disrupted social networks .

we want to develop these little tiny capsules about the size of a piece of risotto that we can put into the muscles and telemeter out the emg signals , so that it &apos;s not worrying about electrode contact .
they talked about feeling stronger and braver .
maybe you ought to buy efficiency at 26 bucks instead of 12 .
and now who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip -- not about you -- was spreading through the network ?
that &apos;s the reason i &apos;m using this podium and using these notes .
sierra leone down there . mauritius is up there . mauritius was the first country to get away with trade barriers , and they could sell their sugar -- they could sell their textiles -- on equal terms as the people in europe and north america .
like yourself , i &apos;m a complex amalgam of positive and negative personality traits that emerge or not , depending on the circumstances . &quot;
so i began drawing the story that was moving in my head .
can you even imagine what that looks like ?
instead of a weapon , just this shepherd &apos;s staff , and he says -- he &apos;s insulted -- &quot; am i a dog that you would come to me with sticks ? &quot;
when i got out i had a choice .

a normal investment bank is not a deposit bank , it &apos;s an investment bank ; it has 15 to 20 times .
it &apos;s some strange woman pretending to be my mother . &quot;
so there is no life possible at that type of mutation rate .
it &apos;s fallen by half .
but daylighting our creeks really improves their water quality and contributions to habitat .
you &apos;d be able to open portions in order to change the procession , allow people to come in and out for an intermission , or to enter for the beginning or the end of a performance .

air quality is an obvious thing to anyone who breathes .
my brother is kind of busy .
and my son , youngest son who studied in beijing , in china , he got a long-term perspective .

these are just for information : hypertension , diabetes , obesity , lack of exercise . the usual suspects .
number three -- isn &apos;t this stuff cool ?
our objective is to be a millennium city , just like many millennium cities around : istanbul , rome , london , paris , damascus , cairo .
this picture was taken last year .
and if one were to eclipse the milky way , this is what it would look like .
throughout human history people have played games .
and you put a little fan here .
well , first of all , let me thank emeka -- as a matter of fact , ted global -- for putting this conference together .
anyway , in this same kind of approach , i designed k.
day one , day two , day three , day four , day five , day six .
we have the magic porridge pot in the form of walmart and tesco .
well , it was the whole city .
there is a problem with vaccines around the world not getting to patients . and the reason is that the refrigeration somehow gets broken ; what &apos;s called the &quot; cold chain &quot; gets broken .
now brunel may have asked a question like this , &quot; how do i take a train from london to new york ? &quot;
it &apos;s axiomatic . why not us ?
the vast grasslands of patagonia are turning to desert as you see here .
apple undoubtedly brings this innovation to us early , but its time was approaching because its core technology had been evolving for decades .
nathaniel kahn : scenes from &quot; my architect &quot;
there &apos;s 21,000 employees . this one factory -- and they had several of them -- is half a kilometer long .
but in the long run , if there &apos;s no life there , we create it ourselves .
so , our call to action -- my call to you -- is for you to make going green your next big thing , your gig .
and over the ensuing few years , there were great sagas about designing biosphere 2 .
augmented reality is just the latest technology .
this effect is so robust that we find it no matter how we ask the question .
so we started to change genes at random , looking for long-lived animals .
talk to people in restaurants .
when did that last happen ?
and it turns out that a sound like this is the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their call across the fields and savannahs .
they looked outside , and then they changed what was on the inside .
we went in underneath and tapped it , and we found that it had the ph of drano .
here is a graph that he put together showing the percentage of male deaths due to warfare in a number of foraging , or hunting and gathering societies .
and it gets worse , i crashed it into your house .
so i remember getting my american passport .
nina tandon : caring for engineered tissue
so i am one of those people with a transformative personal story .
rb : no . i suppose if you &apos;re having problems getting a booking in a restaurant or something , that might be worth using it .
or , even better , let &apos;s just take people right out of the emergency room -- undefined , community-acquired respiratory tract infections .
as i slowly lost my speech , i gained my voice .
this whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point where i could say &quot; synecdochically &quot; to all of you .
and i think it &apos;s an idea worth spreading .
now , most school districts can &apos;t really afford organic food , but we , as a nation , have to start thinking about consuming , growing and feeding our children food that &apos;s not chock-full of chemicals .
it &apos;s china there , moving against better health there , improving there .

torsten reil talks about how the study of biology can help make natural-looking animated people -- by building a human from the inside out , with bones , muscles and a nervous system . he spoke at in 2003 ; see his work now in gta4 .
for two reasons , i think .
this is a dolphin that is self-aware .
i &apos;ve had the privilege of living by a meadow for the last little while , and it is terribly engaging .

well , we know that they can roll balls in a straight line using celestial cues .
but they failed , almost completely , to make any .
the first kind tells you , &quot; you can do it ! you can make it ! anything is possible ! &quot;
this is a big question now to help us understand why they should be in the city .
we call this antiangiogenic therapy , and it &apos;s completely different from chemotherapy because it selectively aims at the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers .
this is just an example of one of these computable documents .
it wasn &apos;t like a telephone system where you had control of a line : you had to share packets .
they go from eight cents a mile in 2010 , to four cents a mile in 2015 , to two cents a mile by 2020 .

we have some cameras on the south edge of the ilulissat , watching the calving face as it goes through this dramatic retreat .
there &apos;s an impact , it &apos;s cumulative .

and they invented , what ? gavage .
despite the fact that each and every one of these disorders originates in the brain , most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis of observable behavior .
living in your genome is the history of our species , and you as an individual human being , where you &apos;re from , going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years , and that &apos;s now starting to be understood .
but when he &apos;s in the arena , at best he wins , and at worst he loses , but when he fails , when he loses , he does so daring greatly . &quot;
secondly , to create even more intensive and strict public demand to reduction of chemicals in the agricultural fresh produce .
&quot; but why ? &quot; i asked him .
so the good news is that earlier this year , the state council passed a new regulation on house requisition and demolition and passed the right to order forced demolition from local governments to the court .

fabian oefner : psychedelic science
we &apos;re actually teaching him .
andy hobsbawm : we &apos;ve got the science , we &apos;ve had the debate .
i work with a species called &quot; bonobo . &quot;
so i was so moved by this -- this is incredible . this was connecting , right .
bush &apos;s bigotry was not an isolated mistake , blurted out in the heat of the moment and later retracted .

the ones on the left are from africa , from around a million years ago .
and then i thought -- in my 40s i started thinking , &quot; well , why don &apos;t i do something ?
are we born to be optimistic , rather than realistic ? tali sharot shares new research that suggests our brains are wired to look on the bright side -- and how that can be both dangerous and beneficial .

what we need are people who see the value in investing in these types of local enterprises , who will partner with folks like me to identify the growth trends and climate adaptation as well as understand the growing social costs of business as usual .
so , they started giving me the statistics on how many of these kids had lost an arm .
now , places that didn &apos;t do this -- new york city for example , moscow , jakarta -- we &apos;re talking , at its peak , one in two injectors infected with this fatal disease .

on it , everyone you love , everyone you know , everyone you &apos;ve ever heard of , every human being who ever was lived out their lives .
we would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with -- of course , in the long run , also to deal with global warming .

without provocation , suddenly she attacked , against her prime minister &apos;s orders , the next-door neighbor &apos;s oil fields .

so we &apos;re 35 years behind .
it &apos;s about a meter tall pavona clavus colony .

there are no contracts , no written contracts .
it &apos;s exciting to see that in terms of what we &apos;ve learned , but how many of those 4,000 diseases now have treatments available ?
once it &apos;s a closed system , you will have legal liability if you do not urge your ceo to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided . the market will work to solve this problem if we can accomplish this .
let me leave with one final thought , and that is that one of the greatest english language writers of the last three decades suggested that great art is always a gift .

it is this underlying assumption of limitlessness that makes it possible to take the reckless risks that we do .
if a soldier sees his friend blown up , his brain goes into such high alarm that he can &apos;t actually put the experience into words , so he just feels the horror over and over again .

people who grew up in a place like this did not have the opportunity to climb trees and form a relationship with trees and forests , as i did when i was a young girl .
and we have a much longer way to go when it comes to the idea of restoring perfect hearing .
it was then that i came across these books , and in these books i discovered the idea of task shifting in global health .
we &apos;re doing 15-minute exams with patients .
it doesn &apos;t matter if you fail .

the military council has cracked down on civil society and protests and the country &apos;s economy continues to suffer .
we &apos;re measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day , particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums .
vodka , gin -- yes . yes . you know your mice well .

you &apos;re mad . i &apos;ll drive . i know i can drive . &quot;
which is why i say it &apos;s a social justice issue .
why are we embedded in social networks ?
so i said , have what , shall i translate the internet into some indian language ? that &apos;s not possible .
i just have a feeling this kid &apos;s been there for a week , you know .
and the wonderful thing is that superstring theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions , but when we study superstring theory , we find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling , new form .
and that &apos;s dopamine-fed . and that &apos;s , &quot; i must have this one person . &quot;
and i just feel , at last , one with the stick and one with the drum .
and since we &apos;ve already had so many problems with police use of non-lethal weapons in various ways , i thought it would be a really good idea to look at some of those things and try to relate it to the military context .
being a journalist , after terence died , i wrote a book , &quot; the cost of hope . &quot;
they &apos;re very low to the water , and they &apos;re all uninhabited , except one island has about 35 caretakers on it .
so here i had this falcon , and it was lovely . it looked really great , the light worked on it really well , it was better than anything that i could achieve or obtain out in the world .
it had &apos; chad &apos; written in magic marker on it .
when i see objects , i imagine them in motion .
but on that mountain where we gain that beautiful peace of mind , what are we really achieving ?
all of industry was in play , as investors flocked to place their bets .
they &apos;ll pop it back on and fix the scratch later .
i hope this worries you , by the way -- when you go to see your physician .
now , you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo .
and what &apos;s more , your wife has just run off with your best friend . &quot;
it &apos;s extremely inexpensive and rechargeable every five years .
we have to keep everything under control .
so there &apos;s another function on here .
we tried to do the same thing by negotiating industry-right deals with the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric and other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools .
they don &apos;t employ those workers .
and i &apos;m applying a similar trick to say , what if we looked at the universe in our culture through the eyes of technology ? what does technology want ?
vusi mahlasela : &quot; thula mama &quot;
and this booking is within all the parameters for each individual .
we actually drilled holes into the ice , way deep down below the thawing level , and had some cameras out there for the past month and a half or so .
so i think half of my book advance went into sunscreen .
and so they started following and watching petty thefts , summonses , all kinds of things -- charting the future essentially .
so now , look at inner conditions . aren &apos;t they stronger ?
no one is better at this activity of actually getting us to engage in delivering services , sometimes where none exist , than ushahidi .
there &apos;s a very short list of these places .
he was a master mechanic , and he taught me how to use tools .
it almost made me feel a little bit guilty about having an uplifting talk about the future .
but he said , &quot; we will partner with you , but we &apos;re not going to invest in it . you need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work . &quot;
in fact , you could be in a bottle with a cap on top , and you would not die at all , and you would not need any fresh air .
so , for example , they can say their work is available freely for non-commercial , this amateur-type of use , but not freely for any commercial use .
well i think back to my childhood , a good part of which i spent , after being born here in chicago , i spent in europe .
in the economic system in traditional africa , the means of production is privately owned .
almost like a ghost , isn &apos;t it , huh ?
we studied the winds and the sun to make sure everybody in the city will have fresh air , fresh water and direct sunlight in every single apartment at some point during the day .
what i then saw in this little moving blue dot was the potential for chaos .
it turned out it was quite clever because deep blue , in a company like bmw , has a hook -- &quot; deep blue , &quot; wow , cool name .
so a big disclaimer is put on everything that i do , and i made narratives about all the european or brit celebrities and comments about our public figures .
you know , you can tell -- and i think when we &apos;re getting into collective play , its really important for groups to gain a sense of safety through their own sharing of play signals .
but , as a cancer doc , this is what i see .
i then thought it would be years before we &apos;d be able to make it really , really useful .
marriage-manual author and semen-sniffer theodoor van de velde -- has a line in his book .
well , the evidence is , unfortunately , ample .
and this is the water feeler .
paul steinhardt , a physicist from new york , and aranda / lasch , architects , collaborated in an installation in london at the serpentine .
this little squid is called the fire shooter now it may look like a tasty morsel , or a pig &apos;s head with wings -- but if it &apos;s attacked , it puts out a barrage of light -- in fact , a barrage of photon torpedoes .
go a couple generations forward to where we are , though , and it looks like a completely different world .
and that brings me to another aspect of this , which is , to whom should this get paid ?
and since i don &apos;t like to travel alone , they also invited my daughter , son-in-law and granddaughter , so we had a lovely trip to see russia today , which is not a very pleasant and happy view .
bp obviously has a bit more on their mind now .
some abilities , of course , decrease with age .
but there &apos;s a fourth thing .
can we map that space , using the language of neutrinos or cosmic rays , taking the bounding condition of the body as its limit , but in complete reversal of , in a way , the most traditional greek idea of pointing ?
so the obvious thing for me to talk about today is graphics and audio .
to you and me , that &apos;s a heart attack .
and for three months out of the year , the surface temperatures go up to 150 to 180 .
this is a little company that &apos;s done very well with simplicity and elegance .
it means that i can take these two identical squares , and i can put them in light and dark surrounds .
it &apos;s sort of an alternative universe .
there &apos;s figs and everything else there for the taking .
i mean , we &apos;ve been doing it for two million years , so it &apos;s kind of arrogant to assume that i &apos;ve got something to say that hasn &apos;t been said and performed better a long time ago .
and you have huge differences within countries also .
we can &apos;t even afford to eat anything except beans .
there &apos;s lots of hormones . there &apos;s testosterone , adrenalin .
pick one : stand up and take three steps , or make your hands into fists , raise them over your head as high as you can for five seconds . go !
things wear out .
because there &apos;s another way of seeing it .
and that may not sound very intuitive , but let me flip over to something else you know about , and that &apos;s computers .
finally they were all arrested and taken to the drancy camp and they managed to get out at the last minute thanks to their argentinean papers .
so i went into the library to figure out how did this thing work .
i was very struck by natalie merchant &apos;s songs last night , recovering old poems .
and they &apos;ve all gone on to master &apos;s and ph.d. degrees in excellent places .
note , that when we went into libya , it was not good enough for the west to do it alone ; we had to bring others in .
it &apos;s a woman . you can see the hair .
yeah , it &apos;s a -- this one here , that &apos;s much better .
that will blow away a lot of the opposition .
i lost the fight , but probably won my life back .
i want to tell you about one family that i met , and why i think they offer clues .
because technically i &apos;ve got motors ; i &apos;ve got wheels -- i &apos;m a motor vehicle .
so , about three years ago i was in london , and somebody called howard burton came to me and said , i represent a group of people , and we want to start an institute in theoretical physics .
the service which grew out of this , dial 1298 for ambulance , with one ambulance in 2004 , now has a hundred-plus ambulances in three states , and has transported over 100,000 patients and victims since inception .
diluting it down to the point where there &apos;s none of it left .
we talked about inertia and organ donations and checking the box .
the steam engine , and the other associated technologies of the industrial revolution changed the world and influenced human history so much , that in the words of the historian ian morris , they made mockery out of all that had come before .
nine hours of feeding per day seems to be the practical limit for a primate .
that , by the way , in case you &apos;re paying attention , is not emotionally correct .
after one harvest , they had increased their income enough to buy a second system to do their full quarter-acre .
it &apos;s not interesting because it &apos;s so common .
two other things that i learned that were very surprising to me -- one was how casual we are about energy .
those pictures we use to analyze how much carbon , how the forest is developing , and we can monitor every tree using satellite images through our cooperation .
and how do we think about materials and structure , sort of as an information and computation problem ?
well it turns out that what happens is the negative data goes missing in action ; it &apos;s withheld from doctors and patients .
i &apos;ve been writing about food more or less omnivorously -- one might say indiscriminately -- for about 30 years .
and what you can see is that nearly all the spider draglines surpass them .
and people would come in and learn more about it .
this is sanghamitra .
when you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more likely to be big brother exerting more control , more secrecy , or us watching big brother , or it &apos;s just all to be played for either way ?
sousa was not a fan of the talking machines .
and since we all smell different and produce chemicals on our skin that either attract or repel mosquitos , some of us are just more attractive than others .
it &apos;s not just competitive , it &apos;s also caring .
&#91; unclear &#93; you just looked like you turned it on its end . but when you see it like that it &apos;s more interesting looking .
he actually coined the term homo sapiens -- it means wise man in latin .
my foot goes down its throat . it spits me out .
70 percent of the kids couldn &apos;t find afghanistan or iraq on a map ; 60 percent couldn &apos;t find india ; 30 percent couldn &apos;t find the pacific ocean .
it &apos;s pretty extraordinary .
and she is definitely on her way .
and they are brilliant ; it &apos;s wonderful work .
maybe i wasn &apos;t as smart , but i was at least as talkative .
this guy thought in the same way i did .
it was breathtaking .
youtube , they &apos;re putting this thing on youtube .
yes ? we heard that .
what happens when the economy recovers ?
and the reason that that &apos;s relevant is that very soon i will be walking into what we call a stage two tribe , which looks like this .
so one of the problems with these small robots is their payload carrying capacity .
and so we can send out sound waves , they bounce off objects like fish and are reflected back .
obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention .
i &apos;m going to show you a couple now .
so if humans evolved as runners , if that &apos;s our one natural advantage , why are we so bad at it ? why do we keep getting hurt ?
and what we need to do now is look at the whole pacific ocean in its entirety and make a network of mpas across the pacific so that we have our world &apos;s largest ocean protected and self-sustaining over time .
what is your ideal , and also , what has been edited out ?
if they want , they can call the granny cloud .
i should be able to ask my house where my shoes are .
maybe you &apos;ve had grand plans before but stopped yourself , thinking , &quot; that &apos;s impossible , &quot; or , &quot; that costs too much , &quot; or , &quot; that won &apos;t benefit me . &quot;
shamsul wares : it was almost impossible , building for a country like ours .
but what does this mean when we have no context for what it is that we &apos;re working on , and we &apos;re just doing these little labors ?
you know , they &apos;re a step in size from the entire observable universe .
it shows these women playing with these toys .
it &apos;s just too damn hard .
what experiments would you run ?
notice that the bottles here have caps on them .
but for the most part , we &apos;ve gone from salting to exhausting .
and that message , very frankly , is valuable for society today .
those cells turn themselves over once every eight years .
he found the foster parents , and he said to them , &quot; treat this as an adoption . he &apos;s yours forever .
and kids could bring in drawings and have the store print a sugar plate for the top of their birthday cake .
thank you .
and that &apos;s what we do to all traffic survivors .
i stay . if i go , i will be killed .
well , i was a grown man who had all of these rituals , and it got so there was a throbbing , there was a ferocious fear in my head .
this market is now estimated at over 800 million dollars annually .
now , one publisher , action publishing , was willing to take that leap and trust me and to listen to what i had to say .
well the swedish students protest at this point .
we want to roll out 15 aims centers in the next five years , all over africa .
let me just show you one thing .
you don &apos;t want to tell americans , god forbid , that they have to change their lifestyle .
and each time i get done with ooh , you may say i &apos;m a dreamer but i &apos;m not the only one 222 .
this was on a monkey hunt , hunting with curare-tipped darts .
of course , the milk can is his .
you are the reason why i said yes to the invitation to come here today .
ag : every scientist will recognize that expression of despair .
i &apos;ll explain it all later , just pay attention to the number at the bottom : plus-7.68245837 minutes that will be my gift to you if i &apos;m successful in my mission .
i think it &apos;s worth the trouble because , again , it just helps us to understand .
aging : the problem is enormous , 300,000 broken hips per year ; but the solutions are extraordinary , and they include so many different things .
assumption number one in the food industry used to be that the way to find out what people want to eat -- what will make people happy -- is to ask them .
what if we combined it with this ?
so it &apos;s actually a multi-dimensional user interface .
no matter how you do that , you &apos;re not going to start with a 100,000-dollar instrument and bring it down to no-cost . it isn &apos;t going to work .
and this is actually how a cancer goes from being harmless to deadly .
so you can &apos;t make it too simple .
what &apos;s great about this is , the tools to do this are free .
and stop where you want .
i like &quot; climate crisis &quot; instead of &quot; climate collapse , &quot; but again , those of you who are good at branding , i need your help on this .
he &apos;s already at war with the iranians , with the king of persia .
this is actually a spanish quarry , which sort of inspired the kind of spaces that these galleries could be .
for this to work , this progress must be sustainable .
i learned about ordinary people who could be heroes .
what if we had a very low commitment , but delivered something individually unique to each person who contributed ?
but things are also changing at a very rapid pace .
so they &apos;re simple building blocks .
&quot; connected &quot; is a collaboration with choreographer gideon obarzanek .
but mary went further .
the game was helping us experience what scientists call post-traumatic growth , which is not something we usually hear about .
and this is what it is .
we paid two to three times more than anybody else .
leslie byrne , a democrat from virginia , describes that when she went to congress , she was told by a colleague , &quot; always lean to the green . &quot;
even though , quite frankly , some of your presentations are horrifying , absolutely horrifying .
in a recent study , the evidence has shown that income is the greatest determinant of how long a democracy can last .
let me give you the example .
when i was sleeping , with a tripod and a timer .
we &apos;re getting tired of it . it &apos;s kind of cliched now .
so what &apos;s going on ?
and as you get to the very bottom , you &apos;re faced with the unfortunate reality that if you don &apos;t save anything for retirement , you won &apos;t be able to afford any housing at all .
and that turns into the title of my first book , &quot; inversions . &quot;
and if you think this is absurd , it &apos;s not .
there are kunskapsskolan schools in sweden .
you add all this up together and of course people are apathetic .
and i think this applies across a very broad -- sort of , a lot of concepts .
that &apos;s me , getting a nasal lavage .
nathaniel kahn shares clips from his documentary &quot; my architect , &quot; about his quest to understand his father , the legendary architect louis kahn . it &apos;s a film with meaning to anyone who seeks to understand the relationship between art and love .
this is the subjective height -- the height you saw of these guys at various points .
and i was just like , &quot; yeah , i guess i am .
and this hallucinatory drawing shows you -- everything you see in this drawing is iluvatar .
from over 12,000 civilians deliberately killed in civil wars in 1997 and 1998 , a decade later , this figure stands at 4,000 .
there &apos;s somebody hiding behind there pulling the strings , whether it &apos;s the illuminati or the bilderbergers .
ladies and gentlemen , i made a different choice .
invest sustainably . majora mentioned this .
and whether you become happy or not depends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch .
this is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity in the global phase of sustainability .
so , at 2.3 billion dollars before the first ball was bowled .
time after time , whenever i set out to share some great truth with a soon-to-be grateful recipient , it had the opposite effect .
but experimental science had been tied up with all those things .
it has an urge , and technology has an urge .
and there , for the first time , i encountered the other religious traditions : judaism and islam , the sister religions of christianity .
it &apos;s not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women .
so , we really will continue to focus on products .
this is more than 10,000 feet higher than the previous world &apos;s altitude record held by the sr-71 blackbird .
anybody who &apos;s over 15 doesn &apos;t know what this means , because in the last 10 years , the number of elementary school classroom teachers has been cut in half .
they first taught us about ecology in the context of natural resources .
in mexico , nike has run a campaign recently called , literally , bid your sweat .
so let me end with just a few words about applications that we &apos;ve found for this .
out of this rubble of haiti and from this devastation came something that we call tera -- the trilogy emergency response application -- which has been used to support the aid effort ever since .
he took apart the archimedes manuscript and the other seven manuscripts .
it &apos;s become this intense industrialized zone .
but in reality , it is managed by and for those who have the resources to go out and exploit it .
so i had 50 overall summaries done .
and it turns out there &apos;s one way .
there was a very important study done a while ago at princeton theological seminary that speaks to why it is that when all of us have so many opportunities to help , we do sometimes , and we don &apos;t other times .
and i of course knew stuff , as a designer , about typography , even though we worked with those animals not so successfully .
what this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating .
and by the way , we should point out that this was not a big meaning .
so that &apos;s all that happens .
so , you &apos;re calling for a global ethic .
we shopped double coupons and layaway and consignment stores , and when she got sick with stage four breast cancer and could no longer work , we even applied for food stamps .
but unless you learn how to mix hard power with soft power into strategies that i call smart power , you &apos;re not going to deal with the new kinds of problems that we &apos;re facing .
in the stomach , the eggs went on to develop into tadpoles , and in the stomach , the tadpoles went on to develop into frogs , and they grew in the stomach until eventually the poor old frog was at risk of bursting apart .
you &apos;re just one of the people who hasn &apos;t been told .
and that &apos;s the end .
and those post-it notes involve this and other proteins of its class -- so-called bromodomains .
one of the burning questions , of course , is if we go there and find life in the sub-surface , as i fully expect that we will , is that a second genesis of life ?
it has nothing to do with the fact that i was born there , of course .
and i thought it might serve as a kind of permanent mnemonic device .
probably , it &apos;s a combination of this .
and as these dark clouds were circling me , and i was finding it really , really difficult to think of anything good , i said to myself that i really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow .
i called my friends , painted on their bodies , and had them dance in front of a painting .
and we see these gravitational lensing effects , these distortions that say that , again , clusters are embedded in dark matter .
and the third thing : it &apos;s a symbol of his influence .
but this phenomenal project &apos;s been happening .
so i start with the ace -- yeah , ace . ah , yeah -- spades ?
so in origami , to obey these laws , we can take simple patterns -- like this repeating pattern of folds , called textures -- and by itself it &apos;s nothing .
that became , as it were , a way of confronting large businesses in the business of wasting food , and exposing , most importantly , to the public , that when we &apos;re talking about food being thrown away , stuff that &apos;s beyond the pale .
it &apos;s the achingly sentimental yearning for times that never happened .
or we can use cells alone , either your very own cells or different stem cell populations .
now , the fundamental basis of neoclassical economics would tell you it &apos;s irrational to reject a dollar because someone you don &apos;t know in another room is going to get 99 .
i do speak to sex workers , 15,000 of them for this particular slide , and this is what sex workers say they earn in an hour .
and so , in 2004 , they commissioned us to do a screen test of benjamin .
as designers , we need to be able to transition in and out of play also .
now we actually have been doing it for a long time .
and one afternoon , i got a call from my doctor .
now , we know that that &apos;s wrong .
you have to go to the literature and look up what &apos;s known about feet .
this is benki .
who is going to raise their hand and say , &quot; i want to hear what you &apos;re doing next , &quot; and sell something to them .
i mean this quite seriously .
the biggest challenge is that material science is complex and requires expensive equipment .
so encouraging people to actually go online and share information and data on blogs and wikis is great because otherwise , low level apparatchiks and bureaucrats will continue concealing what &apos;s actually happening in the country , right ?
and that means the complete cycle of coming from inside , out to the physical , to someone perceiving it .
much later , robert maillart &apos;s bridges , which optimize structural form with a calculus curvature almost like a parabola .
when you multiply that by all the nurses in all the wards in 40 hospitals in the system , it resulted , actually , in a pretty big impact .
what we &apos;re told in terms of arguments against leaving this country is that the fate of the women is primary .
then there are other things that don &apos;t cost much and achieve absolutely nothing .
so they had created these artifacts .
i made a promise to her grandmother , your mother , that i would find a family , and now i &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re going to take care of her . &quot;
so i believe that we have an ethic that the earth grows our food , and we need to move to an ethic in this century that the earth should grow our homes .
as you know , it &apos;s not going to turn out well .
i almost couldn &apos;t finish it .
you &apos;ll notice , of course , that there are hot spots -- south asia , africa .
will eventually joined a gang and committed a number of very serious crimes , including , most seriously of all , a horrible , tragic murder .
and i had an armored organization at that point .
this is an area thought to be involved in expressive communication .
my family &apos;s living in the hilton hotel in scotts valley .
so let me go on the next short video .
but it doesn &apos;t count the health of our children or the integrity of our public officials .
but the pleasure and the passion and the joy is still there .
beautiful , because it has symmetry .
and i described to them some of these lego experiments , and they said they felt like they had just been through that experiment .
they were saying , &quot; this is explicitly intended to give police an option between shouting and shooting .
he said , &quot; well , you just bend time and space , it takes an awful lot of energy , and that &apos;s just how you do it . &quot;
and you know some of them would probably be terrible chairs .
some pundit with too much time on his hands has reckoned that the new experiments are approximately 100 trillion times better than they were in 1960 , 100 trillion times better .
we spend 100 billion dollars a year on diet aids .
it &apos;s usually some kind of choice between the vocational and the intellectual .
every day , all of us here , we &apos;re building gods that have gone rampant , and it &apos;s time we started knocking them down and forgetting their names .
they tell us to have a bath .
let me just ask you one question first .
and i think this is beginning to happen in the entertainment business .
basically , a human body is a conversation going on , both within the cells and between the cells , and they &apos;re telling each other to grow and to die , and when you &apos;re sick , something &apos;s gone wrong with that conversation .
the global economic financial crisis has reignited public interest in something that &apos;s actually one of the oldest questions in economics , dating back to at least before adam smith .
and it was a funny kind of sick feeling , but i turned him down .
because architecture is also the asking of questions .
and this is what we spend a lot of our time doing , is just making sure that we can keep up with this kind of traffic load .
and i &apos;m really excited about this , because it &apos;s a very compact core .
but well done , him .
so just to take some quick examples : people text or do email during corporate board meetings .
if we look at the data , we can see that the answer to that question is , mmm .
and that will happen , paradoxically -- everything you hear about global warming -- when we hit co2 down to 10 parts per million , we are no longer going to have to have plants that are allowed to have any photosynthesis , and there go animals .
so , completely irrational , you would think .
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been building the suburbs with a lot of unintended consequences .
charles hazlewood : trusting the ensemble
he was saving lives with this machine .
so this is the story of bread as we know it now .
so i can determine , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re excited or whether you &apos;re aroused , or not , ok ?
eventually , it will be able to have to stay up day , night , day , night , for six months at a time , acting like the synchronous satellite , but only ten miles above the earth .
this becomes an isosceles triangle -- again , very shaky .
and four years later , as i said , it &apos;s been seen by four ...
so i feel that we have a bio-ethical imperative .
right ? so this is the first example .
the illiteracy rate in china among this generation is under one percent .
i think that means doodling is native to us and we simply are denying ourselves that instinct .
actually , the idea came out of an argument that i had at starbucks , that i insisted that i wasn &apos;t having colombian coffee ; the coffee was actually pre-columbian .
his counterpart is not college-educated and works as a laborer , works as a clerk , does low-level white collar or blue collar work in the economy .
can you imagine your world without it ?
so three questions i &apos;d offer you .
there are common elements of this that you &apos;ll see throughout chicago , and then there are your big-d design statements : the pritzker pavilion done by frank gehry .
now this is a tactic that patent trolls are supposed to use on people to get their way .
but when it &apos;s moving back and forth , the retina picks up these changes .
so that christmas -- maybe i &apos;ve got time for this -- that christmas i got the mister wizard fun-o-rama chemistry set .
we have to understand why people are not saving , and then we can hopefully flip the behavioral challenges into behavioral solutions , and then see how powerful it might be .
if you look at the last 35 years and different social transitions from dictatorship to democracy , you will see that out of 67 different cases , in 50 of these cases it was nonviolent struggle which was the key power .
because the more things that are familiar , the more things my hands know how to do , the more things that i can be happy and busy doing when my brain &apos;s not running the show anymore .
this is an un-retouched -- this is not a joke -- un-retouched photo of microsoft word , the copy that you have , with all the toolbars open .
but these clinics have treated tens of thousands of patients to date , many of them children , and spect imaging involves a radioactive injection , so exposing people to radiation , potentially harmful .
what is the exact relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and planetary temperatures ?
as far as we know , evidence to discover the most fundamental truths of all the sciences is here just for the taking on our planet .
but you don &apos;t want to get all of the insects .
it &apos;s our prejudgment that it &apos;s underground .
we have to turn that around .
and so you see this whole society getting frustrated about losing some of its mobility .
was to adopt a very classical model of fear .
you can see from the slide , very very strong .
every day , 24 hours , that pump is at your side , administering medicine directly to your heart , and it &apos;s not a particularly preferable medicine in many senses .
the earliest cell phones , the earliest personal computers were invented in the 1970s .
marvin minsky : health and the human mind
and this is where it gets really interesting , because it &apos;s not that simple , because we are not simple .
all the grayed-out species disappear .
you can also see the evolution of the one-child-only policy as it travels through the bloodline .
and so education needs to work by pull , not push .
they wished they &apos;d not packed rice .
i &apos;ve spent most of my professional life researching media and entertainment and its impact on people &apos;s lives .

there is something more though that has to be there .
like i said , pollen carries the male sex cells .
it &apos;s called the standard model -- beautifully simple mathematical equation .
and we have to realize that we are all going to into this , down to here .

and if a cloud goes past , you can see a cloud on the tips where it &apos;s letting the light through .
i thought narcissism meant you loved yourself .
and that led me to this project .
so i think , yes , there may be ways that non-lethal weapons are going to be great in these situations , but there &apos;s also a whole heap of problems that need to be considered as well .
so , i started out in &apos; 95 with this exhibition that was called mutant materials in contemporary design .
and that changed everything for me . it was totally life changing .
could we have fuel without fear ?
six to eight months , they &apos;re totally equivalent .
the international cat video film festival didn &apos;t have that much of a reaction .
she reaches into her purse and hands him a 20 .

they were killing people . they were doing whatever they want because they have power .
we &apos;ve driven in cities , like in san francisco here .
so , for example , if i was angry and had to hide it , which i often did , being very adept at concealing how i really felt , then the voice would sound frustrated .

we &apos;ve got plenty of these things .
this is a social map of the hijackers and their associates who perpetrated the 9 / 11 attack .
this has come &apos; round to be that all those naked pachyderms have aquatic ancestors .
they &apos;re encoded in the dna .
and i said , &quot; shallow affect : an inability to experience a range of emotions . &quot;
so he &apos;s got memory .
ten million americans already have this for one reason or another , but really worryingly , 16 percent -- roughly one in six -- of american teenagers suffer from noise-induced hearing disorder as a result of headphone abuse .
because if we can do that , if we can actually just collect the data electronically , digitally , from the very beginning , we can just put a shortcut right through that whole process of typing , of having somebody type that stuff into the computer .
we hope that all of you will come to see the allosphere .
the hard problem that alice chose was the rising incidence of childhood cancers .
when public sector debt is low , governments don &apos;t have to choose between investing in education and health and paying interest on that debt you owe .
there are microbes which , through their metabolism , produce hydrogen sulfide , and they do so in large amounts .
all i know is how to make refrigerators . &quot;
maybe you think about the tragically boring board games that hold us hostage in thanksgiving situations .
that was our hf radio antenna .
i want to show you some moments of history in my journey , which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world .
rd : yeah ?
biology -- we have co-adapted through biology to like bright colors .
janet echelman found her true voice as an artist when her paints went missing -- which forced her to look to an unorthodox new art material . now she makes billowing , flowing , building-sized sculpture with a surprisingly geeky edge . a transporting 10 minutes of pure creativity .
here you see a patent for an arm in 1912 .
do you remember what it was ?
she did it because she ran a country that had a national health service .
and hopefully in the next five years , i &apos;ll be giving you a tedtalk on that .
of course we don &apos;t .
we just need you to be authentic and real and say , &quot; we &apos;re sorry .
it turns out that , in fact , the world was given this gift in 1738 by a dutch polymath named daniel bernoulli .
that &apos;s before we got up to the four bucks a gallon .
suppose the rules are : every time you offer somebody a drink , you give them the drink , and you give them your styrofoam peanuts too .
audience : 93 .
because i tried to make it intimate .
i mean , these are state assets .
so the next time that one called i let him get halfway through his spiel and then i said , &quot; you sound sexy . &quot;
delusions and hallucinations are hallmarks of the illness .
if a child soils its nappy at 8 : 30 , he will have to wait several hours before it can be changed again .
now , my breakthrough came in a very unlikely place , possibly the most unlikely place for innovation : my high school biology class , the absolute stifler of innovation .
so this work is nothing but like -- because of the focal length of the lens , it just shows what is on the other side .
and it turns out that different things crystallize out at different stages .
we saw how ps 234 worked .
now you might wonder , how can people fit in a tiny village only this big ?
however , to me , the 500 is really just the first 500 .
and aren &apos;t we grateful for our brains that can , you know , take this electrical impulse that comes from light energy to create images in order for us to explore our world ?
the sun burns our peripheral vision .
so i cold-called the ceo of prostate cancer canada , and i said to him , &quot; i have this most amazing concept . &quot;
there &apos;s a clock , clock , clock , clock .
by month 12 , we could argue whether there &apos;s a little bit of material around the edges , but it &apos;s essentially completely gone .
now , that &apos;s a great idea , but what i &apos;d like to say is that , in fact , this is a great metaphor for the way that ideas happen .
we wanted to know if what is being done is effective .
and we &apos;re a pretty small staff , which is me .
but then i started thinking about my family .
high pressure builds over india .
now , the africa progress panel , led by kofi annan , they &apos;ve calculated that congo may have lost more than 1.3 billion dollars from these deals .
and we don &apos;t have any industry at all -- it &apos;s only because of this deforestation .
and i went off on assignment and came back a week later , and father keene said , &quot; i &apos;ve got to talk to you about hyun-sook . &quot;
i &apos;ll let you hear a sample of that voice .
now i &apos;m going to show you this in 3d .
but at any rate , they are there .
and i will try and explain to you what &apos;s wrong with this notion .
if you take this thing , you know very well it weighs very little .
but that &apos;s not the prime candidate for life in the solar system .
by expressing it as an if-then statement , you can get the message across without appearing to boss another person around .
proteins are targets for drugs .
here you &apos;re looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe and you &apos;re seeing billions of galaxies , right , and nodes , but you realize they &apos;re not even the main structure .
this lady , she developed a herbal pesticide formulation .
we see that there is no quick fix .
even the sutherlands told me that they had an agile thanksgiving , where you had one group of people working on the food , one setting the table , and one greeting visitors at the door .
why is it that martin luther king led the civil rights movement ?
how clever would we have to be ?
our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each , on minute timescales .
some people actually come back and say , &quot; oh , you want to screw me . let me show you what i can do . &quot;
or are there contexts where we &apos;re far better off taking the passenger &apos;s seat and have someone else drive ?
thanks for having me .
and not works for the left or the right , but works for the left and the right , the citizens of the left and right , because there is no sensible reform possible until we end this corruption .
krista donaldson : the $ 80 prosthetic knee that &apos;s changing lives
for reversing disease , that &apos;s what it takes , but if you &apos;re just trying to be healthy , you have a spectrum of choices .
because i realized that nature had invented reproduction as a mechanism for life to move forward , as a life force that passes right through us and makes us a link in the evolution of life .
i had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak , looking like the michelin man .
so rovs aren &apos;t new .
jl : i won &apos;t use them . thank you .
the first two are shared with many , many other species , and they are really coming out largely of the brain stem and whatever there is of cortex in those species .
this material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true .
please join us in this epic adventure .
but remember , the people in baghdad , the people in iraq , the people in afghanistan -- they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day .
321 is 103,041 . 103,041 .
and they &apos;re now fully capable of handling any of the loads you would see in flight -- just like putting down your convertible top .
now some of you might actually right now be thinking , it &apos;s downright crazy to have 10 tedtalks summarized into just six words .
diane downs : at night when i close my eyes , i can see christie reaching her hand out to me while i &apos;m driving , and the blood just kept coming out of her mouth .
there is the orange system .
i believe this is going to democratize health care .

five years later , those women lived twice as long , and you can see that the people -- and that was the only difference between the groups .
this film shows the testing of a new explosive fill on a warhead .
so i can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fresh perspective and see if i can optimize it in its most idealistic fashion .
and it began when i flew back from london after my time at the u.n. in kosovo .
now , the shortcut .
mtv europe worked with us and made that spoof , and they &apos;ve been slipping it in between music videos without any introduction , which i think is kind of fun .
this experience of working with duke also led me to initiate a program called sound science .
we can &apos;t sustain this without the measure of our success really changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red .
but he was , in fact , a moral philosopher , and he was right on why we &apos;re moral .
but the interesting thing is , of those three , india &apos;s looking real good , as you just saw in the data .
here &apos;s the virgin mary on the backside , which they started to wipe off .
the split starts to emerge between those in the military who see a future they can live with , and those who see a future that starts to scare them , like the u.s. submarine community , which watches the soviet navy disappear overnight .
in this map from moldova , the green color shows those districts that have low spending on schools but good educational outcomes , and the red color shows the opposite .
there are all these different things for us to get the data that we need to do .
it &apos;s little discrete -- that &apos;s spelled d-i-s-c-r-e-t-e -- bits .
it happens when i dance , when i &apos;m acting .
i &apos;m a storyteller .
this room may appear to be holding 600 people , but there &apos;s actually so many more , because in each one of us there is a multitude of personalities .
there were 20 ph.d. &apos; s plus me and the professor crammed into this tiny office space with them firing these rapid-fire questions at me , trying to sink my procedure .
and when we said to our parents and grandparents , &quot; how would you feel if tomorrow morning you woke up black ? &quot;
and i think that institutions should stand up and release all their data under unrestricted licenses , and it would be a great benefit to everybody .
the second school i was at had big trees too , had a fantastic tulip tree , i think it was the biggest in the country , and it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation around it , around the playing fields .
it &apos;s the kind of original movement for any puppet for us onstage .
shea hembrey : how i became 100 artists
and here &apos;s the peeling action of the mecho-gecko .
she picks the water up from there , desalinates it , for free , transports it over there , and dumps it onto the mountains , rivers , and streams .
so , because nobody in their straight mind would row straight past hawaii without dropping in , i decided to cut this very big undertaking into three segments .
it &apos;s a full spectrum of tools .
plan b appeared in its first full-blown form in 1998 -- something called the digital millennium copyright act .
very soon we will all be dead and gone , but the problems will stay , unless we have people taking over from where we stopped .
to say ahh , if this happens then we are going to have a pandemic ?
so , everyone told me afterwards that inviting the prospective parents over was , again , the stupidest thing i could have possibly done , because who &apos;s ever good enough for your relative ?
he mumbled something about his mother , and i told him she &apos;d probably find him outside anyway .
she &apos;s 16 years old .
so that is the house of tata .
and that means that if we want to avail ourselves of it , we &apos;re allowed to postulate chemical events in the origin of life which have a probability as low as one in 100 billion billion .
you can &apos;t just look at the dessert cart as say , &quot; no , no , no . that looks disgusting to me . &quot;
volcanoes erupt .
and that was , of course , the very common story .
and this is all big raised platform .
school -- and remember , i made it through one year , so i think i &apos;m qualified to talk on school -- is a game , it &apos;s just not a terribly well-designed game , right .
john q. walker : great piano performances , recreated
my colleagues and i have been working for 10 years to rediscover this lost world in a project we call the mannahatta project .
what about a wolf ?
and then it bursts into a forest of redwoods .
well my personal story , my personal journey , what brings me to the ted stage here today , is a demonstration of exactly what &apos;s been happening in muslim-majority countries over the course of the last decades , at least , and beyond .
when we look at a map of los angeles or london , it is hard to believe that as of 2005 , only 15 percent of the world was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail .
and we thought it had something to do with this protein called amp kinase , an energy protein .
why would daddy bring elder revels ?
i see a lot of hands coming down .
and the way i look at it is : if you don &apos;t have knives and forks in your school , you &apos;re purely endorsing , from a state level , fast food , because it &apos;s handheld .
and we helped him build a company , for profit , that would build on ide &apos;s knowledge , and start looking at sales and exports , and be able to tap into other kinds of capital .
who &apos;s going after chinese , which now has 400 million internet users out there ?
it is about action .
and i plan to start from a cliff , like catapulted from a cliff .
and so this is one of the great challenges that is going to happen .
so now the next question you may have is , well why can &apos;t we just pay people to do this ?
we felt like we were surrogate parents .
you may not appreciate the person , you may not appreciate anything else , but maybe you appreciate the fact that they &apos;ve got a tough gig .
this is like -- it feels like the united nations just here .
and he says , &quot; well i used to be a banker and now i &apos;m a gold miner . &quot;
it &apos;s called an allele .
and i &apos;m like , knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all a &apos;s .
they will completely lose .
the first is -- death is a big problem .
if they won &apos;t submit , kill them .
sometimes these pieces are mathematical , in that way that i look at a shape and say , what about if i use this and this and this .
but again , that only shows part of the picture .
that &apos;s what i wanted to do .
there &apos;s no manual . this is exactly what you expect , especially if you haven &apos;t interacted with a computer before .
we can &apos;t see into the engine room .
and i &apos;ll just say what i &apos;m about to do . what i &apos;m about to do -- i hope you can recognize that there &apos;s a distorted sine wave , almost a triangular wave upon this hewlett-packard oscilloscope .
and the birds on the floor tend to have lower pitched calls , so that they don &apos;t get distorted when they bounce off the forest floor .
in fact , i &apos;ve heard it said in the disability community that there are really only two types of people : there are those with disabilities , and there are those that haven &apos;t quite found theirs yet .
now , when you think of a coral reef , this is what most people think of : all these big , hard , elaborate corals and lots of bright , colorful fishes and things .
when we landed on the drop-zone , everything had changed .
for example , a trillion dollars of real estate remains uncapitalized in india alone .
so i went to cambridge , because it was really the best place in the world then for x-ray crystallography . and x-ray crystallography is now a subject in , you know , chemistry departments .
in the cities , a lot of the cost of property is actually wrapped up in its speculative value .
this is what &apos;s called a hydrothermal vent .
i wanted a pure thing , and i can &apos;t get it .
thank you .
i parked a different place every night so i would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police .
50 percent of the women accused me of playing a trick , of putting the same color nail polish in both those bottles .
i was having my inscriptions , my admission to biology .
because they &apos;re focused on honoring what is most beautiful about our past and building it into the promise of our future .
that &apos;s my question .
a mexican composer : arturo marquez .
it &apos;s pretty annoying for the fishermen .
so , it &apos;s not quite as good as you might think , you might hope .
i &apos;d like to share with you the story of one of my patients called celine .
and these can be things that maybe you &apos;re already doing .
there &apos;s self-acceptance , there &apos;s family acceptance , and there &apos;s social acceptance .
bf : up and over his shoulders .
and it gets quiet .
and the organisms , i promise you , have all of their priorities in order .
it &apos;s beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration .
the present joins a flow of time from before and after .
well , we feel that now is the time to prove we &apos;re right .
so every grain of sand is unique . every beach is different .
i didn &apos;t feel sick at all .
and something very unusual happens .
the estimated range is between 20 and 50 percent for a series of goals of biodiversity and fishery enhancement and resilience .
thank you .
and this tells me one of two things .
and that &apos;s what that moment with patricia schroeder i think shows : that if we are to bring about an end to the world &apos;s worst atrocities , we have to make it such .
and she said , &quot; no , those are the lights of key west . &quot;
technology is transforming the face of food vulnerability in places where you see classic famine .
did i know anything about this ?
this is from a global survey .
it took quite many years for the program to become what it is now .
and we would visit each other .
and with our hyper-consumption of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease , kindness might just be a bit of a red herring .
kirk citron : and now , the real news
second , the development institutions that channeled these transfers were opaque , with little transparency of what they financed or what results they achieved .
there &apos;s two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change -- so on .
this act defines what a national lottery will look like .
but the media lab is an interesting place , and it &apos;s important to me because as a student , i was a computer science undergrad , and i discovered design later on in my life .
they are not going to touch that , because it &apos;s not your matter .
so , maps of things leading to organized understandings of the universe in which we emerge .
so historically there has been a huge divide between what people consider to be non-living systems on one side , and living systems on the other side .
and this is why things don &apos;t get done at work -- it &apos;s because of the m &amp; amp ; ms.
his mother showed up the next week at my brother &apos;s classroom and begged seven-year-old kids to share with her any picture they may have of her son , for she had lost everything .
three to four feet , it might as well have been a football field away .
if that is indeed true , biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation ?
after that point , they thin out a lot .
and then what the best part is , we started getting a flood of videos in of people doing crazy things with it .
look at this thing and say , &quot; well , i didn &apos;t think i was a very good sleeper , but actually i did better than average in 50 to 60 year olds . &quot; ok ?
white-nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats .
there &apos;s many things about it . it becomes very simple , and basically what you &apos;re doing is you &apos;re just touching the machine , you &apos;re touching the cloud and you &apos;re going to compute that way .
and she said , &quot; but the thing i liked about your talk is you &apos;re a storyteller .
and it goes around and around and around , the same way that military-industrial complex worked a long time ago .
david pizarro : the strange politics of disgust
jh : it looks like we &apos;re loaded for bear here .
that after 10 years , the focus on the construction sector would have produced both jobs and , hence , security -- because young people would have jobs -- and it would have reconstructed the infrastructure .
the quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons .
and so the lesson is this : it doesn &apos;t really matter what you &apos;re selling ; you just have to think about who is your customer , and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior .
when i was a boy , in front of every house in the summer evenings , you would find young people together singing the songs of the day , or the old songs .
what is multimedia-tasking ? it &apos;s the fact that most of us , most of our children , are engaged with listening to music at the same time as they &apos;re doing search on the web at the same time as they &apos;re chatting on facebook with their friends .
in other parts of the world , you have an infrastructure that allows for manufacturing to take place .
i will try to explain to you about the context of why and when i posted .
you cannot ask people to work under these conditions .
and joe was very worried about the device that he was working on .
so if mom does put a blanket over the baby , it &apos;s still receiving effective phototherapy from below .
it &apos;s a dead world . nasa should not spend any time or effort studying mars anymore . &quot;
she only wants to spend time with her friends .
so , when i get those calls about performance , that &apos;s one thing .
the kids were amazing : extremely eager and often very bright .
this is another case where a theoretical paradigm in biology really worked -- was the germ theory of disease .
and coming back to the car , i always used to say that the car is like your mother-in-law : you have to have good relationship with her , but she cannot command your life .
this is a u.s. customs and border protection room , a contraband room , at john f. kennedy international airport .
and fraser &apos;s on his knees , arms tied behind his back , and he &apos;s crying .
and we also use functional mri , called fmri , to take a video , a movie , of brain activity when participants are taking part in some kind of task like thinking or feeling or perceiving something .
what if the sky was 41 percent gray ? wouldn &apos;t that be the perfect sky ? &quot;
the project launched in april 2005 .
now , i have to apologize to our magician friend lennart green .
but probably even more important is that the work that comes out of these years flows back into the company and into society at large , rather than just benefiting a grandchild or two .
when you look at the biggest user and the second largest user , we use 20 million barrels and the chinese use 10 .
and occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin and the two of us enjoy each other , and each one tries to get out of their own , and ultimately it fails of course , and then we &apos;re back into this thing .
the mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this , but not terribly successfully .
as his spirits sagged , his body deteriorated until , i believe , he slowly brought about his own death .
this looks nice .
i know because we have reports from seychelles , which fit in as well , down here .
third step is cognitive dissonance .
so imagine a grid , like the one i &apos;m showing you right now , and now imagine , within that grid , that two-dimensional sheet , imagine neurons .
he happened to be a birder .
but the process itself is without purpose , without foresight , without design .
this is a very good year .
well , who are we not to say this ?
there are , i don &apos;t know , some lessons from all of this , personal and political -- and in a way , they &apos;re the same thing .
to borrow a phrase from carrie fisher , which is in my bio there ; i &apos;ll just toss it out again -- &quot; these days even instant gratification takes too long . &quot;
and afrigadget is a blog that looks at technology in an africa context .
and watch it now slip , and see what it does with its tail .
therefore , any curriculum for training emotion intelligence has to begin with attention training .
in 1967 , in the middle of the biafran-nigerian civil war , dr. njoku-obi invented the cholera vaccine .
so there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now , but the problem with some of them is that they &apos;re not scientific enough .
poverty breeds despair . we know this .
laugh though you will , all the drug dealers and gang members with whom i dealt had one of these long before any police officer i knew did .
but it seems like by investigating , by attacking cancer , by searching where cancer is not , there has got to be something -- there &apos;s got to be something -- that &apos;s making this tissue resistant to tumors .
and that means that there is a one-way transfer of energy from our environment into our homes and cities .
so , it seemed that the toxin that was killing the gharial was something in the food chain , something in the fish they were eating .
and i was protecting the project from it , i realized . i was protecting it -- i didn &apos;t want this special , little group of photographs to get sullied in some way .
i was making all these scribble pictures .
but this is how we do it in the united states .
benki knew this .
when i &apos;m photographing them , i cannot help but remember my grandfather &apos;s lesson .
or , you take this particular un-retouched photograph . now , interestingly enough , i get a lot of emails from people who say , &quot; is there any perceptual difference between males and females ? &quot;
that set me on the road to examining biomechanics .
around each one of our courses , a community of students had formed , a global community of people around a shared intellectual endeavor .
audience : five . five .
this defines the imagined futures of our fellow hungarians -- robicsek , teszler and bartok -- as it does my own .
and i think , look at the tsunami , it &apos;s a classic example .
and it sounds like an easy problem .
audience : oh , 722 .
so , we &apos;re down there , and this is at 400 feet -- that &apos;s looking straight up , by the way , so you can get a sense of how far away the surface is .
since it &apos;s organic , i &apos;m really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals .
she paused and said , &quot; i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s 6,000 yuan or 6,000 american dollars , but anyway , it &apos;s 6,000 . &quot;
this is from my second book .
we self-edit as we &apos;re having ideas .
so we have to be disciplined and focus on things that are critical .
covering the tragic tune with something different , something radically different .
or wait to capture the second half of it .
isn &apos;t that cool ?
and we &apos;ve already started construction on section two .
this is about justice . really .
so i quit my degree , i headed off to the himalayas , i became a monk , and i started studying meditation .
so here is some nectar from my film .
if you go on the streets of india and china , you see this kind of stuff .
it even beeps , because it &apos;s an alarm clock , after all .
so , that &apos;s just one use . incredible , there is probably 350 , 400 uses .
now this is several years ago . adjusted for inflation , it &apos;s a decent sum of money for a few minutes of work .
and then it was only later that i realized how very similar these questions were to the ones i used to ask myself as a child frightened in the night .
it even had an offshoot running to haifa in what is today israel , on the mediterranean sea .
really , this is more about putting the player in the role of george lucas , you know ?
so with that , i &apos;ll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : geography always matters .
of course , africa is a continent full of catastrophes : there are immense ones , such as the horrific rapes in congo and depressing ones , such as the fact that 5,000 people apply for one job vacancy in nigeria .
well , i can tell you that this divergence that you &apos;re seeing here doesn &apos;t happen only in our five-minute experiment .
but with &quot; disappear , &quot; there &apos;s really no analogies -- so evan , what you want to do here is to imagine the cube slowly fading out , okay .
you start sweating to dissipate the heat that you &apos;re going to create from muscular exertion .
because this is the place if aliens land , i hope they come here .
and i don &apos;t know when or how it happened , but the speed at which i went from being a talented writer and journalist to being a homeless woman , living in a van , took my breath away .
and it would be a lovely thing to be able to wave to someone and have all our reiterations wave at the same time .
it &apos;s real , what &apos;s happening .
this is the death star .
during this 60-hour siege on mumbai , 10 men armed not just with weapons , but with technology , were able to bring a city of 20 million people to a standstill .
what you can see over here is tamara , who is holding my phone that &apos;s now plugged in .
if you &apos;ve got that , you &apos;re with me for the entire journey . okay ?
juanita is her name .
we &apos;re talking &apos; 95 now .
in a political campaign , you start with no interest and no capacity to turn that into action .
i can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are .
so what then distinguishes the israeli / palestinian conflict from that in northern ireland , or the civil war in sudan from that in liberia ?
before that , they were all soft , fluffy structures .
thank you .
thanks very much . it &apos;s been an honor .
science has the power to predict the future in many cases now .
thank you .
i control the brain in order to understand how it works .
now , when looking at africa vis-a-vis other things , and countries in africa vis-a-vis other things , comparisons become important .
the surimi sticks &#91; of &#93; crabmeat , or is being sold as crab meat , is white fish that &apos;s being dyed with cochineal .
i needed teachers , in the classroom , every day , who were going to say , &quot; you can move beyond that . &quot;

we &apos;re taking over a thousand samples for each brain .
and then , for instance , this other exhibition that was entitled workspheres in 2001 , where i asked different designers to come up with ideas for the new type of work styles that were happening in the world at that time .

anybody do any writing today ? did anybody write a word ?
so for the first time , i got invited to speak at the national parliament .
and the guy that made this , he made a slot machine out of lego .
why ? because the taliban withheld education during the period of time in which these men and women would have learned to read .
do they all get there on time ? the supply chain .
one , empire was the least original thing that the west did after 1500 .
maybe i can come back next year , or something like that .
and the next lines are , &quot; through the unknown remembered gate , where the last of earth discovered is that which is the beginning . &quot;
i won &apos;t send any more commandos in until i know it &apos;s safe .

magic isn &apos;t that intense . i have to warn you , though , if you ever play with someone who deals cards like this , don &apos;t play for money .
it &apos;s rain . africa is fertile . they can grow the crops .
and in 2008 , in chengdu , sichuan area in china , nearly 70,000 people were killed , and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor .
there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world .
so if you think of a map of your country , i think you &apos;ll realize that for every country on earth , you could draw little circles to say , &quot; these are places where good teachers won &apos;t go . &quot;
so , with all of these things put together , i think that the chances of life are much greater than i would &apos;ve ever thought .
this includes about three and a half to six years for a site permit .
some of your own regrets are also not as ugly as you think they are .
thank you .
go ahead and play this one .
it &apos;s in your tedgift bag . no , no .
it is actually a living connection to the cosmic event that we are part of , and a story that is certainly ongoing .
in 1989 , i entered the british foreign service .
you learn things unconsciously .
imagine what it means for your personal security as a heavily armed civilian population gets angrier and angrier about why this was allowed to happen .
we can &apos;t have anything to do with you . &quot;
self-control is not a problem in the future .
boyd varty : what i learned from nelson mandela
ed : awl , also , good that the leather crafter &apos;s guild is here .
so the first thing we &apos;re going to do are the things that don &apos;t require a lot of robotics .
so this project really has taken on this inner organic life of its own .
twenty-three percent said , &quot; yes , as soon as possible . &quot;
now , he tries e again . that chord doesn &apos;t work .
i see -- always , it stirs my heart -- a picture of dr. martin luther king , jr .
because our hamburger recipe , our ultimate hamburger recipe , if you make the buns and you marinate the meat and you do all this stuff , it does take about 30 hours .
if they then mixed with each other there , then those modern humans that became the ancestors of everyone outside africa carried with them this neanderthal component in their genome to the rest of the world .
and so when thomas jefferson wrote in the declaration of independence , &quot; we hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , &quot; he did not mean &quot; we hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are clones . &quot;
we could have a coast-to-coast , free wireless communication system .
at the end of that time , i went off to australia , about 20 years ago .
and if we can understand leadership like that , i think if we can redefine leadership like that , i think we can change everything .
there are other dimensions for flaps .
we should draw examples from these different illustrations , not to have diplomacy which is disconnected from people and civil society .
it &apos;s really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark and try to put a tag on it .

often , speech and thinking become disorganized to the point of incoherence .
so i am a pediatric cancer doctor and stem-cell researcher at stanford university where my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation .
now we &apos;ve talked a little bit about how to talk to someone who &apos;s lying and how to spot a lie .
why ? because as your attention shifts to your cell phone , you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly to the car braking in front of you , and so you &apos;re much more likely to get engaged into a car accident .
and i was rather taken aback .
in fact , the west has lost its work ethic .
i needed to put it into a context .
and so a year ago , i showed this off at a computer show called e3 .
but for me , the reason for this actually has to do with dogs .
so what i did , i took all those emails , and i put them together into something called angrigami , which was an origami template made out of this sort of vile stuff .
by young students from standford university on an extreme affordability project that they had , basically .
we must disenthrall ourselves , and then we shall save our country . &quot;

from the zen master seng-ts &apos;an : &quot; if you want the truth to stand clear before you , never be for or against .

theo jansen : i want to put these forms of life on the beaches .
but i felt it was too much to ask to have to adjust each individual armrest in order to get it where you wanted .

sorry , start again .
these are potential sources for high-speed data transmission .
it &apos;s hard to teach , and it &apos;s not all that easy to learn .
now , if .0001 of these cells got mutated , and .00001 got cancer , you will be a lump of cancer .
see , evolution protected us during our childbearing years and then , after age 35 or 40 or 45 , it said &quot; it doesn &apos;t matter anymore , because they &apos;ve had their progeny . &quot;
yeah , boston .

most of us -- now that the &quot; me decade &quot; is well in the past -- now we actually do this .
but at the time , that was the largest molecule of a defined structure that had been made .
and then in 2003 i started parikrma humanity foundation from my kitchen table .
and this is possible because civil society joined the companies and joined the government in the analysis of the problem , in the development of remedies , in the implementation of reforms , and then later , in the monitoring of reforms .
now , i &apos;m also really big on photography .
something like this , not very pomp , not very sophisticated , this .

they &apos;re emotional . they &apos;re aware .
it &apos;s essentially there &apos;s no sign of life from outside at all .
it just so happens that stewart &apos;s brand of funny doesn &apos;t work unless the facts are true .
we have this tendency to think that only solid , material things are really things at all . waves of electromagnetic fluctuation in a vacuum seem unreal .
and the sum looks like this .
i certainly would like to know what happened to the person who had that insight back then , if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion .
the consequence of the single story is this : it robs people of dignity .
and that changes the equation slightly , doesn &apos;t it ?
more special people , more special places .
and my timing was not great either : 2005 , when i did the atlantic , was the year of hurricane katrina .

after having spent more than a decade understanding , studying , and trying to convince policymakers and donors about what was wrong with africa &apos;s agricultural markets , i decided it was time to do something about it .
we are primates , so the correct comparison is to other primates .
and that &apos;s exactly what we did 10 years ago .
they all have the same virus , but they &apos;re different enough that there &apos;s reason to believe that they &apos;ve been independently acquired .
but i was convinced i was going to get him to buy a license plate protector .
now my place is 90,000 people who are respecting each other , who are not fighting .
we &apos;re awfully careful in the lab to try and avoid various biohazards .
for people to experience who you are .
but it &apos;s a great intention to have in a relationship .
tonight , i want to have a conversation about this incredible global issue that &apos;s at the intersection of land use , food and environment , something we can all relate to , and what i &apos;ve been calling the other inconvenient truth .
so i said to him , &quot; do you want to come with me ?
it was such a smooth ride .
and , even more luckily , the guy said that he was sorry and i bribed him for compensation money , otherwise i press charges .
this is the first stunt woman , rosie venger , an amazing woman .
bl : you see this white v-shaped mark on the back of the shrimp ?
but experts do get things wrong .
and then she looked back up and said , &quot; i would ask him to forgive me for being his mother and never knowing what was going on inside his head . &quot;
so as we continue here , i want to tell you about what this is like in factories .
now if you give the partner grapes -- the food preferences of my capuchin monkeys correspond exactly with the prices in the supermarket -- and so if you give them grapes -- it &apos;s a far better food -- then you create inequity between them .
so i &apos;m not the first to figure this out . this is a quote from brian eno : &quot; the problem with computers is that there is not enough africa in them . &quot;
and it is in the total of all those acts that the history of this generation will be written .
another reason is our american emphasis on the virtues of self-reliance and independence , so we instinctively look down on older people who are no longer self-reliant and independent .
when i was a child , i lived in california , which is , you know , mostly a very nice place to live , but for me as a child , california could also be a little scary .
compare the banker in 1900 , who really just needed a good accountant and to know who was trustworthy in the local community for paying back their mortgage .
here &apos;s the second problem : you can have 60 dollars today or 60 dollars in a month . which would you prefer ?

and we go to live concerts , and we get that as much as we can .
you know , there is some push and pull , but design is really helping define the whole experience from the inside out .
if you go back a few hundred years , all around the world it was a very closed society .
the stuff has a very short half-life , same with brain science .
it was around this time we went from 1k to 16k , which was quite the leap .
how do we put real information and real structure into new ideas , and see the world in a different way ? and it &apos;s not going to be binary code that defines the computers of the universe -- it &apos;s sort of an analog computer .
we were actually recording history .
the parents predicted the kids would say , spending more time with them .
and so , i lived in kigali for about two and a half years , doing these two things , and it was an extraordinary time in my life .
and that comes in tremendously handy , because groups are smarter than individuals .
do you feel like you &apos;re moving a thousand miles an hour ?
we felt helpless .
and i said , &quot; that &apos;s a good job . that &apos;s interesting .
lastly , you want to be the nurturing agent .
i know ; i spent a lot of my career in artificial intelligence , trying to build machines that could do some of this thinking for us , that could give us answers .
once you get the formula right you can replicate it .
so the wings have their own parachute , and you have your two parachutes .
this is the outcome from a patient perspective -- same day after the treatment .
ed : all right . now last week , when i did this , you had me measure that spot to the right .

this is a picture here taken from orbit .
where they have the same kind of security to take risks .
well , let &apos;s first look at the probability -- and this is very , very difficult to estimate -- but there have been only four studies on this in recent years , which is surprising .

the woman paid him no heed .
it is so big , they have taxis in the mall .
these guys can tell us .

you , like the people that are trapped in my work — — have become part of my work as well .
and the landscape was always made by this sort of weird , uneasy collaboration between nature and man .
guess what ?
the reason is kurdistan .
i tend to win those arguments , because i know the tricks .
those were three things that i stuck with pretty closely all the time .

luckily , those patents did not exist everywhere .
and the deal that they strike is the extracting country gives kiribati five percent of the landed value .
this is the second generation . it &apos;s going to be in flash .
they don &apos;t shy away from infrastructure .

our idea of mobility is trying to make the connections between all the systems .
thanks .
now this is a totally reasonable assumption , given that i have made quite a habit of encouraging people to spend more time playing games .

so as we think about power in this century , we want to get away from this view that it &apos;s all i win , you lose .
regulate , regulate , regulate .
and social business needs markets , and there are some issues for which you just can &apos;t develop the kind of money measures that you need for a market .

i suffered through spanish for junior high , first year of high school , and the sum total of my knowledge was pretty much , &quot; donde esta el bano ? &quot;
salmon sharks aren &apos;t the only sharks we tag .
and as we think about that , let &apos;s take inspiration from the absolutely amazing capabilities of the human body and the human mind .
then , after some moments , you just go a little back , and then it starts burning .
and this was an important thing about 19th century technology , that all these relationships among parts could make the most brilliant idea fall apart , even when judged by the most expert people .
here &apos;s lesson number one .
i thought there were them and there were us , and i was not one of them .
now broadmoor is broadmoor hospital .
you have your interpretation . we have ours .

this is something i call the 50-20 paradox .
the gray dots have grown exponentially .

a classic example is james hansen , a nasa climatologist pushing for 350 parts per million carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
the sense of , you know , life could be better , i could join this -- i could be a perfect person , i could join this perfect world .
and they look something like this .
gregory petsko : the coming neurological epidemic
and that was : what is the purpose of this ?
kb : now , anything coming at all ?
and we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends .
because one thing he did know , that when fathers are connected to their children , it is less likely that they will return .

in what i call the flushed-and-plumbed world that most of us in this room are lucky to live in , the most common symptoms associated with those diseases , diarrhea , is now a bit of a joke .

there &apos;s my very own saturn v.
jf : and before leaving , we would like to show you another kind of mathematical problem that some of the boys have worked out in their spare time , in a less serious vein , for a sunday afternoon .

this happens 160 times per second , and if anything fails in this process , rezero would immediately fall to the ground .
stars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together .
so this is one of our experiments .
i call this &quot; groundswell collaborative consumption . &quot;
but even as morality binds people together into a unit , into a team , the circling blinds them .
and it certainly was .

these never really caught on either : the electric shoe warmer and drier . never a big seller .
so i &apos;ve looked at about 70 of these .
there is a profound need to belong .
it &apos;s really only a successful escape .
and then , the most important thing is , it gives us large math for low cost .

we got an inside look at the gang , from the very bottom up to the very top .
and sometimes just taking an interest in the individual , in the fellows you &apos;ve met , and the businesspeople you &apos;ve met , it can make a huge difference , especially in africa , because usually the individual in africa carries a lot of people behind them .

which was a very good thing , providing low cost clothing .
all we have to do is go around and sample , dig into the ground , find those bugs , sequence them , correlate them to the kinds of characteristics we like and don &apos;t like -- that &apos;s just a big database -- and then fertilize .

you pick them up , and once you see something that you &apos;re interested in , the staff person can scan them in and then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store .
so it &apos;s not just about the number of people ; the system itself creates a disincentive to conserve because you can lose your water right if you don &apos;t use it .

he was struggling to explain something to me : a beautiful experiment that uses lasers to cool down matter .
it &apos;s a hard problem because the water sloshes about , but it can do it .
in 1990 , she was asked this question .

it &apos;s very powerful work .
why are statisticians not measuring these ?
it &apos;s because of curtis cooper that we know , currently the largest prime number we know , is 2 ^ 57,885,161 .
so the human brain is larger than it should be , it uses much more energy than it should , so it &apos;s special .
to one group he said , &quot; i &apos;m going to time you to establish norms , averages for how long it typically takes someone to solve this sort of problem . &quot;

and the real tragedy was , if you look through her records , she had been seen in four or five other health care institutions in the preceding two years .
and i used to be one , so there .
iceland &apos;s a nordic country , so , like norway , it &apos;s able to tap into the system .

it &apos;s one of my favorite bathing suits .
well no , not pieces of plastic , but stone seals , copper tablets , pottery and , surprisingly , one large sign board , which was found buried near the gate of a city .

well , it uses it to defend itself from its predators .
feel free to survey me if that helps .
we then gave them the choice between number three and number four .
at the beginning , it can &apos;t walk at all , but it will get better and better over time .
but this is not just about students sitting alone in their living room working through problems .
the reason it &apos;s different is that , just in the past few years , our machines have started demonstrating skills they have never , ever had before : understanding , speaking , hearing , seeing , answering , writing , and they &apos;re still acquiring new skills .
it starts with a foundation , basic skills .
there is so much diversity around the globe .
the vast majority of economists -- it is so uncool to call yourself an ideologue of either camp .
and the very next shot , right after this -- so you can see what i was doing .

if they &apos;d been observed in phase , the theory would have been refuted .
i began to collect every instance of circle-triangle-square .

as you all know , that return from exile , the second temple , reshaped judaism .
this is producing all sorts of tensions , all sorts of dynamics that are deeply disturbing .

those girls have never touched google .
i &apos;d like to talk to you today about the human brain , which is what we do research on at the university of california .

governments are not changing it . why ?
finally , we could make the particles migrate to over the poles , so we could arrange the climate engineering so it really focused on the poles .

the next thing that happens is the light ends evaporate , and some of the toxic things float into the water column and kill fish eggs and smaller fish and things like that , and shrimp .
using the very first telephone , watson was in fact dialed into the heavens .
maybe the system , of which i was a part , was letting you down .

the best civil engineers we had , the best planners , the best architects .

and as we heard last night , as we &apos;ve heard earlier this week , are absolutely , fundamentally vital to the ability to craft new solutions , is we &apos;ve got to craft new political realities .
many women were taken as slaves by rebels and soldiers , as sexual slaves who were forced also to carry the ammunition and the water and the food for the soldiers .

but if you &apos;re boltzmann , you know that if you wait long enough , the random fluctuations of those molecules will occasionally bring them into lower entropy configurations .
jh : well , i love the idea that somewhere within this idea of fine motion and control with the traditional skills that you have with your hand , some sort of more elemental force gets revealed , and that &apos;s the beauty here .
it quickly escalates .
we need someone for .

craig venter &apos;s tremendous and brilliant attempt to dna sequence things in the ocean is great .
for each project we do a film .
then it came way down .
and that , and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that , may be , in the end , the finest reward that we earn from this journey of discovery that started half a century ago .
they all come up and they &apos;re like , &quot; you know , my aunt &apos;s sister &apos;s babysitter &apos;s dog &apos;s chicken went to china and adopted a girl . &quot;
i have been there for a long time .

as late as 1992 , ibm was known to say you couldn &apos;t possibly build a corporate network using internet protocol .
well done , everyone . now that is worth plus-one physical resilience , which means that your body can withstand more stress and heal itself faster .

and i asked them to do a project together , tackle the issues affecting their country in cartoons , yes , in cartoons .
then i was very lucky to win the competition to build the second pompidou center in france in the city of metz .
only three percent were lawyers or doctors or teachers .
in essence , what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve studied the science , we &apos;ve looked at the behavior , we &apos;ve seen over 2,000 kills by these amazing animals .
all right , i &apos;m going to get on my knees and do it .
the students should teach their teachers .
today , indian women have a sizable life expectancy edge over indian men .
the reason i &apos;m showing you this is i &apos;m hoping that the scene that i &apos;m going to show you will look familiar and sound familiar , now that you &apos;ve listened to some girls &apos; voices .
we also have the sweat bees , and these are little gems flying around .
having gone through the data , i then needed to demonstrate where that food ends up .
&quot; ... youngest republican , &quot; okay , we &apos;re finished .
you can read it in about two hours .

i have to take a moment .
we addressed on the board the major questions that have not been answered .
the telescope , going up in space , it unfolds in two places .
i was not an activist .
because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space , the same size as our home , the solar system . now that cube is very empty by human standards , but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter .
i will tell you a little bit about irrational behavior .
that &apos;s a homemade noise dampener .

the maximum efficient distance for regeneration is only about one centimeter .
it could get awkward , right ?
often the first time anyone saw what happened to their house was on virtual earth .

what i discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces .
but as we look , what &apos;s out there , we &apos;ve barely scratched the surface on what is available on this planet .
so we are four of us in four corners of the world .
you would think it might take eight years to go back to the same speed , maybe 10 years -- no , it &apos;s 45 years .
there are little machines doing things in experimental bases .
it was unequivocally not something a squirrel could chew on .
thank you .
if we had started in 2005 , it would have required emission reductions of three percent per year to restore planetary energy balance and stabilize climate this century .
the reasons for this have a lot to with the dominance of the two big demographic groups right now : the baby boomers retiring -- and then there &apos;s a gap , generation x , which is a small generation .
depression , for example , is the third-leading cause of disability , alongside conditions such as diarrhea and pneumonia in children .
em : there actually are far more charging stations than people realize , and at tesla we developed something called a supercharging technology , and we &apos;re offering that if you buy a model s for free , forever .
i don &apos;t necessarily think the film is so interesting .
so , for the essence of what makes the difference to enable progress , seek good explanations , the ones that can &apos;t be easily varied , while still explaining the phenomena .
such a random jumble of letters is said to have a very high entropy .
and this represents their habit of basking on the surface when the sun is out .
fiction is flowing water .

there are so many good things which are happening right here in kibera .
so , we &apos;ve targeted those systems to make the molecules work better .
so , to begin with , however , i have to give you a very , very quick lesson in developmental biology , with apologies to those of you who know some biology .
let me act compassionately .
so people get wrapped up in it . and we took a team of designers , and we sent them off to america . and we gave them a budget , what we thought was a set of deliverables , a timetable , and nothing else .
it &apos;s in that context that i work .
because before the &quot; vagina monologues , &quot; i will say that 80 percent of my consciousness was closed off to what was really going on in this reality .
i don &apos;t know what this kind of stuff will do in their gills .
now this was -- you make a joint of six , you make an icosahedron .
i can give you fast control with low reduction ratios in these gears , or i can give you power ; i can &apos;t give you both .
i will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat .
mandela , the great man mandela .
let me tell you the story of shriram , an 18 month boy in bihar , a northern state in india .
these decisions are clearly a reflection of the actor &apos;s policy .
but that , as i said , we live in this environment where all these obstacles are being put in our way .
in coal mines , this canary was supposed to be close to the miners .
so they will , in fact , be quite easy for us to detect .
it &apos;s a several thousand-pound animal .
and in my little corner of the world , these two things are actually related , and i want to tell you how tonight .
i don &apos;t eat breakfast . no lunch .
so you &apos;re feeling the wind -- and this tremendous wind now that you &apos;re going to be feeling -- and you want to go perpendicular to the wind or downwind , if you are in fact able to see where the blast was in front of you .
keep your seats -- it &apos;s going to be okay .
the body yes , but not all the motor skills that we have .
and the differences in scale between this tiny sea dragon and this enormous humpback whale was like something out of a science-fiction movie .
we get one from mom , one from dad .
i took the copenhagen subway map and i renamed all the stations to abstract musical provocations , and the players , who are synchronized with stopwatches , follow the timetables , which are listed in minutes past the hour .
now the lesson of that seems clear to me , and i don &apos;t know why it isn &apos;t informing public debate .
all of those are gone .
we &apos;re still trying to explain and come to terms with what is the evolutionary advantage of this .
nobody &apos;s ever done it before , so i &apos;m going to go do it .
the second reason i undertook this is because i &apos;m concerned about the rise of fundamentalism , religious fundamentalism , and people who say they take the bible literally , which is , according to some polls , as high as 45 or 50 percent of america .
let me tell you a little bit about how languages fundamentally differ .
we just think of good weather and bad weather .
or you can go to places like this .
now there are still barriers in front of we people with disabilities .
they weren &apos;t allowed to stay there anymore ; they had to be returned to vienna -- as i say , an unfeasibly long way away in those days .
one day , 16 years after i had this poster on my wall , i lay in bed and looked at her , and i suddenly thought , i wonder what the painter did to her to make her look like that .
and this substance may seem invisible to us , but it has a physical reality .
and it need beavers to create the wetlands , and maybe some other things .
that &apos;s basically how this thing operates .
over here , you see a paleographic chart that shows what has been deciphered so far , starting with the letter a , &quot; ālep , &quot; at the top , and &quot; bêt , &quot; in the middle , and so forth .
and he was really gagging . i thought he might throw up on me , actually .
we are not good at reasoning with uncertainty .
i don &apos;t work with people in any kind of traumatic situation .
instead of having vaclav smil &apos;s &quot; massively fatal discontinuity &quot; of life , we can ensure the continuity of life .
next challenge , the biennial of the americas in denver asked , could i represent the 35 nations of the western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture ?
dad helped design the control panels for the ibm 360 computer .
or is it an imitation of one half the set of sounds we make to express disappointment ?
because i want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible .
i played in the backyard , learned to read , and even ate some of my vegetables .
you guys were amazing .
little did we know at that time that a trip to the dump and some research on the internet and plucking up the courage to act upon inspiration would take us on a life-changing journey of accidents and discoveries .
it &apos;s been a real honor . thank you .
you may think that &apos;s a weapon right there . in fact , that &apos;s a stamp . i used a stamp to defend canada &apos;s borders .
reputations are volatile . loyalties are fickle .
and the way to ask that question is to look at the neanderthal that comes from southern europe and compare it to genomes of people who live today .
can &apos;t you move them over to a place where there &apos;s less of a risk ? &quot;
if you had an acute congestive heart failure , they could bleed a pint of blood from you by opening up an arm vein , giving you a crude leaf preparation of digitalis and then giving you oxygen by tent .
but the thing is , i don &apos;t want to be a traffic cop .
now , if we &apos;re talking about medicine , and we &apos;re talking about healing , i &apos;d like to quote someone who hasn &apos;t been quoted .
so you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government .
so there &apos;s a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better .
science is objective , consciousness is subjective , therefore there cannot be a science of consciousness .
i brought my scientific colleagues and sustainability practitioners into the prison .
we either draw in a liquid sample , or we can actually take a solid core from the wall .
now these are multifunctional areas of the brain .
i mean , even here , yesterday i was walking across the street , and they showed three bishops were executed 500 years ago , right across the street from here .
and here &apos;s one that does concern me .
obviously trial and error is very important .
they can &apos;t subordinate those interests to the greater global public good .
and , in fact , emotional contagion can be broader still .
it gets me to meet incredible contractors like this , jim ellenberger from ellenberger services .
he negotiates with the serbs .
sometimes it can take two years to type that information into a computer , and sometimes , actually not infrequently , it actually never happens .
and for each car so financed , scrap almost one clunker , preferably the dirtiest ones .
if i take these countries back to the years of their independence , which is almost the same year -- &apos; 71 , &apos; 72 -- it &apos;s a quite amazing development which had happened .
if i project that , that would make me think that i would live until 120 if i don &apos;t crash on my motorbike .
what &apos;s pushing on it ?
so , it was a really big deal when the letters showed up .
in her case , i knew there was nothing i could do that was actually going to save her life .
and for example , some things we could do that would be policy solutions which are not really in the political air right now but perhaps with the change of administration would be -- use markets .
but for us , i want to talk about three factors today .
we go back regularly .
we have no idea what we &apos;re going to discover .
this was even before the web .
do you have that ?
we need networks that can find out what &apos;s going on .
and this is visible in the unstoppable change in language -- the fact that by the time the academy finishes their dictionary , it will already be well out of date .
you have to pay the army and the police to show law and order .
and thank you to all the photographers .
so one of the reasons that i have come here to talk about this today is to -- frankly , selfishly -- unburden myself and let it be known that this is not an untroubled mind that has written all of these books .
and in 1945 , he published an article in a magazine called atlantic monthly .
just push them through , good . thank you .
so i &apos;m going to show you now a little experiment that we did .
the inhabitants literally built up these homes with their own hands , and this labor of love instills a great sense of pride in many families living in this tower .
so anyway , you &apos;ve got basically an idea of where things came from .
and with a particular rotation , we can look down through this pattern in eight dimensions along a symmetry axis and see all the particles at once .
we want to clear away the toxic soil from this area and have an organic garden .
so how does electricity ignite residential fires ?
beauty and seduction , i believe , is nature &apos;s tool for survival , because we will protect what we fall in love with .
if you ever go bar hopping , who do you want to take with you ?
and i think that that is very troubling , and in a sense , i &apos;ve been reflecting on turning that part of us off .
she said , &quot; yes , sir . &quot;
there are only 700 atms in the country . opportunity .
we had a memorable fight . feminism is dated ?
way back machine . and i said to myself , oh yeah !
i then go to a news site , look for some headlines .
i got an indoor sunburn doing this while shooting in los angeles .
the second question is , who are you connecting ?
this is an opportunity ! energy needs -- it &apos;s an opportunity .
natasha : later , i &apos;ll do that later .
emily dickinson once wrote , &quot; parting is all we need to know of hell . &quot;

so &quot; god is in heaven surrounded by his angels &quot; was translated as -- &#91; igbo &#93; .
about half of them , 600,000 , have permanent damage to their heart that will cause them to have very bad problems later on .
in other words , we can &apos;t create supermodel mice .
so we &apos;re able to do the simulation , but this is two days on a desktop .
now to put some neurobiological meat on this abstract model , we constructed a simple one-dimensional world for our favorite subject , fruit flies .
the center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment .
okay .
we &apos;re obsessed with morality as social creatures .
you then put a membrane on that and you apply pressure -- so that &apos;s part of the extra program .
but at the same time , when we hear that the housing market is hopeful , we think , &quot; oh , my house is definitely going to double in price . &quot;
if we had redwood-like biology , if we got a touch of gangrene in our arm then we could just , you know , extract the nutrients extract the nutrients and the moisture out of it until it fell off .
and we then wanted to see whether we can match our ancestral maps with digital maps made somewhere in the world .
this is a perfect 90-degree angle by nature .
and what vannevar bush was saying was the way we use information is broken .
some of them were hypothermic , some of them were frostbitten , some were both .
so everything that matters , that &apos;s important , is invisible .
that &apos;s the quest .
what &apos;s interesting is that at the same time , the number of genes that we &apos;re discovering is rising very quickly .
and so what we needed to do was increase the wing area so that we just had more grip , develop higher forces .
and as we just heard earlier , of course , we &apos;re also learning how to put information on dumb objects .
that &apos;s a very appealing picture , however , it &apos;s just not true .
this particular classroom happens to be in the state of michoacan .
i saw this leaflet and it said , &quot; there are millions of slaves in the world today . &quot;
it makes sense , right ? there &apos;s open space , the planes can take off and land without worrying about creating noise or avoiding tall buildings .
they have two types of flight muscle : so-called power muscle , which is stretch-activated , which means that it activates itself and does not need to be controlled on a contraction-by-contraction basis by the nervous system .
theories can be shared , and you don &apos;t have to be a professor with multiple degrees to have your ideas valued .
he &apos;s not happy , and why isn &apos;t he happy ?
after about 15 seconds , her friend appeared -- she had been hiding behind a display -- and they laughed and hugged each other and ran away .
ok , i can see , if i found something , up , up , and they continue , up up up .
the camel smells were unbelievable .
we have our first stars .
thank you .
we can cope with the subtleties of language brilliantly -- and there are interesting evolutionary questions about how we got here .
hold on .
there &apos;s also a time to give .
now , retro-vaccinology is just one technique within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design .
now , i did not speak portuguese .
we are all cut from the same genetic cloth .
so we are faced with a paradox .
if you press on a hose pipe in a sealed system , it bulges someplace else .
let me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion .
so , different species of plants grow in different places , and some pollen carries further than others .
i wanted &quot; upwake &quot; to have the same audiovisual qualities as a movie would .
back to the theme of the presentation : in multidisciplinary research , how on earth does a process engineer used to working with boilers end up producing a medical device which transforms his own life ?
as pascal said , even the one who hangs himself , somehow , is looking for cessation of suffering -- he finds no other way .
he set up his prosaically entitled newsgroup , bankfrauds @ yahoo.co.uk before arriving in britain in 2005 to take a masters in chemical engineering at manchester university .
thanks so much for your talk .
robert ghrist : welcome to calculus .
well , he had all these wonderful little golden apples , and she &apos;d run ahead , and he &apos;d roll a little golden apple .
well i &apos;m afraid not .
and you can see it &apos;s not that easy , that it is war which caused this .
well i find parents out on the front lines very aware their children are going down for the count .
the fear is that the longer we delay any solution , the more the world will look to the u.s.
well for the sake of time , i want to focus on just three strategies .
in this deceptively casual talk , charles leadbeater weaves a tight argument that innovation isn &apos;t just for professionals anymore . passionate amateurs , using new tools , are creating products and paradigms that companies can &apos;t .
the digital universe is the basis of our space show productions that we do -- our main space shows in the dome .
use more force ?
imagine a restaurant that serves michelin-starred food , but actually where the restaurant smells of sewage and there &apos;s human feces on the floor .
the viruses , those quasi-organisms among which are the prophages , the gene weavers that promote the continued evolution in the lives of the bacteria , are a virtually unknown frontier of modern biology , a world unto themselves .
he said , &quot; we have lived in this world where little things are done for love and big things for money .
but it &apos;s only half the story if we &apos;re really looking at solving problems of poverty , because it &apos;s not long-term sustainable .
the icon of icons finally has a face .
anyway , he was a photographer and a street educator , and he always taught us to obey the law very strictly .
and today &apos;s political slogan is , &quot; bijli , sadak , pani , &quot; which means &quot; electricity , water and roads . &quot;
now if you look at the cost of opec , it cost seven trillion dollars -- on the milken institute study last year -- seven trillion dollars since 1976 , is what we paid for oil from opec .
if i really want the music to go there , the best way for me to do it is to listen .
and the game is won .
and his colleagues don &apos;t think of him as a crank .
a harrowing predilection for the uses of force had become commonplace , with an equal distaste for the alternative forms of influence .
and the last thing is that -- actually , the direction of the conversation .
but if you &apos;ve graduated from high school , i can almost guarantee you &apos;ve seen this information before .
they couldn &apos;t anticipate cell phones and the internet and all this kind of stuff .
actually he did , but it turned out to be the u.s. air force , which doesn &apos;t count as extraterrestrial intelligence .
it probably has lies in it as well .
i &apos;ve felt it in the operating room , at the bedside .
so i scraped a load of reported figures from various news outlets and then scaled the boxes according to those amounts .
it &apos;s physically possible to lose weight .
i &apos;m interested in what i like to call the &quot; triple bottom line &quot; that sustainable development can produce .
everything left over is external to me .
pete alcorn : the world in 2200
but if you put something on top of it , it disbalances it . and so it would tip over .
mega-farms , feed lots , chemical amendments , long-distance travel , food processing .
and this is : how do you make a teacher great ?
so that means that certain parts of the periodic table are axiomatically off-limits .
they have to have a much more participatory governance in many civil society organizations .
if i put the flap on the edge , it uses a half circle of paper .
the charges of all known particles can be plotted in a four-dimensional charge space , and projected down to two dimensions like this so we can see them .
with this event , a new era in native american history began .
no , because a widely shared design practice doesn &apos;t necessarily give you a unity of culture -- and it definitely is not &quot; in the dna . &quot;
it &apos;s an indian story about an indian woman and her journey .
and they can send the poison into the system .
wk : i think we have discovered a very important issue in the arab world -- that people care , people care about this great transformation .
my brother , henry , he died tragically when we were teenagers .
1985 , right at the center of the reagan years -- that &apos;s , we &apos;re , there &apos;s , we &apos;ve , it &apos;s .
no , it &apos;s pockets of walkability on the sites of under-performing properties .
and i wanted to finish with this photograph , a picture i made on a very stormy day in new zealand when i just laid on the bottom amidst a school of fish swirling around me .
and on this farm there was the farmer , his wife , and there was the four-year-old daughter .
we change as people through games , because we &apos;re involved , and we &apos;re playing , and we &apos;re learning as we do so . thank you .
that &apos;s all that &apos;s necessary .
and so today , i would like to present to you a few examples of what this represents .
we &apos;re pasting portraits -- so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market .
but be careful .
so , how could this happen ?
the fort in san francisco at the time had about 1,300 soldiers .
and we realize how great would it be if we just had some a , b , c and d labels to talk about them more easily .
remember i said feeling , model , reality ; i said reality doesn &apos;t change . it actually does .
and it goes down the sides and goes into the critter &apos;s mouth .
and this is the answer -- we would have to change .
love , action .
in the last three years , i &apos;ve traveled to 45 different countries , working with schools and companies in the midst of an economic downturn .
i can see his hands reaching out , and i can see his face in terror , looking at me , saying , &quot; help me , dad . &quot;
and it was just lightning fast ; the way she was working was almost unbelievable .
so that &apos;s a bit of a support for the leviathan theory .
it is taking the hand of the architect to actually remove the hand of the architect in favor of the hand of the artistic director .
and they &apos;re focusing on function .
another example , this was completely packed with houses , and then we built this , what we call , a knowledge square .
do they , perhaps , include green infrastructure , so that we can take runoff and water that &apos;s going out of our houses and clean it and filter it and grow urban street trees ?
these are the sentiments of someone that &apos;s been away from home .
so it was traumatizing , actually .
it sits there about , say , 1.3 times the mass of the sun .
and generally arrive about 30 pounds lighter at the other end .
and the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies , just barely walking and talking , would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers , but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli .
paint your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward , 100 years forward , how you would like to think of the world , balancing moral progress with richness .

to tell you the kinds of societal challenges that are going to come up in the new machine age , i want to tell a story about two stereotypical american workers .
now , i started out as a strategy professor , and i &apos;m still a strategy professor .
he &apos;s by far the happiest man ever measured by science .
it &apos;s not , perhaps , the dimensions appreciated by art critics or architecture critics or city planners .
you know , all i wanted to do was draw pictures of horses when i was little .
now maybe cows have a really rich internal mental life and are so smart that they choose not to let us realize it , but we eat them .
how do you evaluate all the scientific data around a product , the data that &apos;s changing on a weekly , if not a daily , basis ?
it &apos;s coming from us .
how we get spectra ?
yet , their draglines are not the toughest .
and by that i mean it &apos;s products for which the research and development costs are really high , and the manufacturing costs are low .
and then i went in and i had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages .
so we must find other solutions .
so that would give us extra cortex to do more interesting things than just operating the body .
for example , if you take , and you make a comparison between a recent kind of city , what i &apos;ll call , simplistically , a north american city -- and detroit is not a bad example , it is very car dependent .
okay , so i &apos;m going to take this really filthy water , and put it in here . do you want a drink yet ?
and now let &apos;s look from the south , looking up , and let &apos;s see this in relief .
and it &apos;s economic empowerment and the ability for a woman to say , &quot; i am as much contributing to this family , or more , than you are . &quot;
when they come to me , they help me to treat the people , to help .
these christians , who are these christians ?

and in the time since galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies , the known universe has come to us through light , across vast eras in cosmic history .
the getty here is moving their books to the ucla , which is where we have one these scanning centers , and scanning their out-of-copyright books , which is fabulous .
they also made a basketball court .
and sometimes you create high art , and sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work .
and hopefully from that i get to learn something .
somehow , without any help or push from her older brother at all , suddenly amy disappeared off of the top of the bunk bed and landed with this crash on the floor .
they fly in and they pollinate .
no legends , no fairytales .
it &apos;s the homebrew computer club -- just like a hackerspace .
and they are heterosexuals who come from countries that have traditions of polygamy and relatively high levels of female autonomy , and almost all of those countries are in east or southern africa .

but much later , in 1871 , he did have something to say about it .
and that &apos;s a problem .
still , we very much wanted to see the aircraft that we &apos;d all helped build in the air , off the ground , like it was supposed to be .
they make use of exactly the same winds .
it &apos;s all that adrenaline rush . it &apos;s hard to give it up .
the man &apos;s sons were banished to live three kilometers away , in a cowshed .
these people inspire me , and they inspire me because they show us what is possible when you change the way you look at the world , change the way you look at your place in the world .
so , three types of vision , right ?
i says , &quot; i enjoyed your film . that &apos;s why . &quot;
each point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry of this very complex and beautiful shape .
we can allow smart and lucrative growth models that help people already be near where they want to be , so they don &apos;t need to go somewhere else .
but by the teen years , the features of transistors will be a few atoms in width , and we won &apos;t be able to shrink them any more .
and i can &apos;t get this thought out of my head , and i can &apos;t get that vision out of my sight , so i did what i had to do .
because it doesn &apos;t look like chinese food to them .
it &apos;s been going on since we can think of lombroso and the way he would define criminal faces .
it could be an &quot; l , &quot; of course .
but well before my imagination was my vocation , my imagination saved my life .
and to me , that is very , very critical .
but it &apos;s sublinear , and what that translates into is that , if you double the size of the organism , you actually only need 75 percent more energy .
outdoor clothier patagonia encouraged prospective buyers to check out ebay for its used products and to resole their shoes before purchasing new ones .
and at one point -- and i had some wine , i have to admit that -- at one point i said , &quot; if there was a contest , i would join . &quot;
&quot; you must get them custom made -- special , humongous guitars . &quot;
that did not make sense . they were not above a magma chamber .
that &apos;s just 12 percent of the population .
now , chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me , so i &apos;ve done that .
yeah !
well , that &apos;ll be all the slides .
so most everyone watches tv .
remember what i said , my love .
but we really need to test that .
so that &apos;s not all of the trials that were ever conducted on these drugs , because we can never know if we have those , but it is the ones that were conducted in order to get the marketing authorization .
and my family moved out of an urban place , where we used to live , to a remote rural area where it was safer .

it enables him to hire men who used to get paid 50 cents a day and pay them five dollars a day .
i want to talk about penguins today .
i still do a lot of that , mainly for estimating .
and feynman also understood this .
and the thing that you really take away from that , the kind of surface thing that you take away from it , is not that we &apos;re all one , although i &apos;m going to tell you about that , but rather how different we are .
what kinds of people would join a global community welcoming people from every discipline and culture , who seek a deeper understanding of the world , and who hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all ?
and so we work on these particular issues to see if we can create a morality from the bottom up , so to speak , without necessarily god and religion involved , and to see how we can get to an evolved morality .
and copenhagen , although it &apos;s a dense city , is not dense compared with the really dense cities .
thou shall not stereotype .
that looks like a coastline .
this is the time to swim with real humility .
there is some good successes .

there &apos;s no question , none , that so-called lifestyle diseases -- diabetes , heart disease , stroke , some cancers -- are diseases that are far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world .
thank you so much . i &apos;m going to try to take you on a journey of the underwater acoustic world of whales and dolphins .
about two months ago , i had the great breakthrough -- one of my great , kind of shining achievements -- which is that my website finally became a top result for &quot; steven johnson . &quot;
we interpret what we see , select the most workable of the multiple choices .
you can imagine yourself being a mouse or fly inside of it , looking out of its camera .

the sharp , crisp outlines of this formation make it the best one for finding shapes in .
if you actually insulate and isolate the machinery of the ship from the hull , you can reduce that noise by 99 percent .
now , those are fun to look at .
and the market reformer was successful there .
if we can get the 10 cents , all the rest of it flows .
now , from the shah &apos;s perspective , though , he wanted to keep this as secret as possible , so when yitzhak rabin , for instance , traveled to iran in the &apos; 70s , he usually wore a wig so that no one would recognize him .
imagine us as a human race not knowing where we came from .
it gives it information . by adding information to matter , it gives it a function that &apos;s different than without that structure .
and the last one i &apos;ve already mentioned , that fell to you .
i get it .
any incentive system can be subverted by bad will .
peace is not &quot; kumbaya , my lord . &quot;
