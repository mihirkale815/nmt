but what is happening is that effectively -- and the invention of the spreadsheet hasn &apos;t helped this ; lots of things haven &apos;t helped this -- business and government suffers from a kind of physics envy .
so those are very important for catching somebody who &apos;s trying to sneak up on you .
and knowing that starts to explain a lot of long-standing mysteries in science .
and we met a couple years ago when we discovered that we had both given a short ted talk about the ecology of war , and we realized that we were connected by the ideas we shared before we ever met .

in fact , many of these vehicles are operated by flight crews that can include multiple pilots , operators of sensors and mission coordinators .
well , that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to talk about today , is how we &apos;re using the tools of genetics , population genetics in particular , to tell us how we generated this diversity , and how long it took .

but the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge , bulky tubes , and they were filled with these scintillating crystals , and you just couldn &apos;t get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors .
so , by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history , selam unites us all and gives us a unique account on what makes us human .

oh , and by the way , here &apos;s how i made your stuff better , &quot; which , wow .
and here comes biology -- biology , with its basic question , which still stands unanswered , which is essentially : &quot; if there is life on other planets , do we expect it to be like life on earth ? &quot;
i want you to get as close to that camel as you possibly can . &quot;
that &apos;s really built into the model if we allow for the possibility of building cities on uninhabited land .

and they certainly didn &apos;t intend to describe the mechanics of supernova explosions , which eventually told us where the building blocks of life were synthesized in the universe .
and what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re using humor as a sort of neuroscientific probe by switching humor on and off , by turning the knob on a joke -- now it &apos;s not funny ... oh , now it &apos;s funnier ...
and you know what &apos;s exciting is that this innovation is now spreading south to south , from the philippines to indonesia , kenya , moldova and beyond .

if anybody here is a fan of the original &quot; star trek , &quot; they ran across an alien ship that had an ion drive , and spock said , &quot; they &apos;re very technically sophisticated .
and this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain , and we call this learned paralysis , ok ?
and also showing oyster gardening for the community along its edges .
to do that we &apos;ll probably need much more sophisticated technology than we have today .
and we finally made it so it appears very sculptural from the main house and all the windows are on the other side .

i used to work for an educational publisher , and as a writer , i was always told never to use stories or fun , engaging language , because then my work might not be viewed as &quot; serious &quot; and &quot; scientific . &quot;
so in this way , by doing this kind of test , we can draw cause and effect relationships between the activity of specific neurons in particular circuits and particular behaviors , something that is extremely difficult , if not impossible , to do right now in humans .
we &apos;ve all seen pictures like this on television and in the news . this is an operations center .
and now 4,000 churches have joined the environmental movement .
but what i didn &apos;t anticipate through that rapid transition was the incredible experience of the juxtaposition of my sighted experience up against my unsighted experience of the same places and the same people within such a short period of time .

so in conclusion , i &apos;ve found the five senses theory to be a very useful tool in evaluating different experiences in my life , and then taking those best experiences and hopefully incorporating them into my designs .
it &apos;s pretty remarkable how smooth an exponential process that is .
but to create a space that never existed is what interests me ; to create something that has never been , a space that we have never entered except in our minds and our spirits .
and only this little bit , only six percent actually ends up accelerating the car and then heating the brakes when you stop .
but wireless technology wasn &apos;t dreamt up then .
i know she really cried for her son .

and i have to say , many of them now in the professional orchestras throughout the world .
we think they &apos;re then stored in the skin , and we think the sunlight releases this where it has generally beneficial effects .
we all need people who will give us feedback .
why did i take the risk ?
okay , try this . bring it back .
so we have had tremendous success , and we kind of got caught up in our own success quite a bit , and we started using expressions like &quot; lifesaving . &quot;
but if we collect it very gently , and we bring it up into the lab and just squeeze it at the base of the stock , it produces this light that propagates from stem to the plume , changing color as it goes , from green to blue .
i was 17 .

and this piece : those aren &apos;t actually leaves .
this climber is on the last pitch of it .
for the last 20 years i &apos;ve been designing puzzles .
we have the serious meme in us .
so , our dictionary for describing cancer is very , very poor .

zk : so now , when we dream up these concepts , it &apos;s important for us to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint .
what kind of an experience do they have ?
so the same strategy that we used to find the code for the retina we can also use to find the code for other areas , for example , the auditory system and the motor system , so for treating deafness and for motor disorders .
and speed of activity , which is something that we face in our work with sub-surface organisms , because they grow very , very slowly .
so then the question is , why can &apos;t we have some kind of shared access ?
you &apos;ll have japanese language classes every day to help you cope .

samuel pisar , an auschwitz survivor , said , and i &apos;ll quote him , &quot; the holocaust teaches us that nature , even in its cruelest moments , is benign in comparison with man , when he loses his moral compass and his reason . &quot;

there was gas rationing in 1973 .
the lowest number of combatant casualties occurred in 2003 , with just 20,000 killed .

because if i can get that right , i can make them wonderful , and i can make them repeatedly wonderful .
guns barking like lightning and thunder .
and so i &apos;m going to use , as the metaphor , this association : quantum mechanics , which i really don &apos;t understand , but i &apos;m still gonna use it as the process for explaining how it is the metaphor .
and the first one , in fact , is something that has been known for most of recorded history .
hold down the shift key to scroll back up again .

and a final possibility is that there &apos;s no relationship at all between learning disabilities and hyperactivity , but that they are caused by a common underlying mechanism in adhd .
that also doesn &apos;t even get into the whole protein extraction that we do from the ocean .
so the final part of the puzzle is , how do you make all this work financially , especially when the people can &apos;t pay for it ?
because we all knew that just six years earlier , half as many penguins had been oiled and rescued and only half of them had survived .

so seeing this in practice , this is the leveraged freedom chair that , after a few years of development , and this is a full-time wheelchair user -- he &apos;s paralyzed -- in guatemala , and you see he &apos;s able to traverse pretty rough terrain .
you &apos;re just too blind to see it now .
this may be organic in letter , but it &apos;s surely not organic in spirit .
you see that south america and africa may be connected in a certain way , right ? other people say , &quot; oh , that sounds ridiculous . &quot; it &apos;s simple . so , what shaped lance ?
what we fear is the judgment and ridicule of others . and it exists .
this is a clock i designed .
i feel as if my blog , my email , twitter and facebook have given me a substitute for everyday conversation .

there will be a spinning magnetic field .
we have to work in these places .
so , i &apos;d about given up trying to get my hands on one of these .
now my grandparents are no longer living , so to honor them , i started a scholarship at the worcester art museum for kids who are in difficult situations but whose caretakers can &apos;t afford the classes .
what do 24,000 ideas look like ? ecologist eric berlow and physicist sean gourley apply algorithms to the entire archive of tedx taking us on a stimulating visual tour to show how ideas connect globally .
kofi annan said , &quot; this will be beneficial to my troops on the ground . &quot;

there are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places .
the trouble is these signals are not the beautiful signals you want them to be .

so i leave you with this third question .
so if we want to utilize self-assembly in our physical environment , i think there &apos;s four key factors .
and not surprisingly , given the human population growth , more than half of the human population is living in cities now .
mit just has a new radio chip that uses far less power than our chips .
so those are not her pearl earrings . whose are they ?
we need to begin from the position that our knowledge , our power , our legitimacy is limited .
there are , in fact , a lot of correlations between the two forms of music i think in different time periods .
and this was the first thing she did .
bin laden is dead . bin ladenism has been defeated .

here &apos;s one example : neuro drinks , a line of products , including nuero bliss here , which according to its label helps reduce stress , enhances mood , provides focused concentration , and promotes a positive outlook .
even mathematicians , who in some sense are the freest of all thinkers , literally couldn &apos;t see not only the sea slugs around them , but the lettuce on their plate -- because lettuces , and all those curly vegetables , they also are embodiments of hyperbolic geometry .
and then look at people who have done business in india , you &apos;ll see the exasperation on their faces .
if governments are less able to affect the problems that affect us in the world , then that means , who is left to deal with them , who has to take greater responsibility to deal with them ?
in fact , apophis is a blessing in disguise , because it woke us up to the dangers of these things .
they &apos;ve been around just as long and gone through just the same kind of trial and error to get here .

leaders , in other words , that people will trust and that they will want to follow even if that means making hard choices .

graham hill : less stuff , more happiness
no comment .
this is the story of the rise and rise of stand-up comedy in the middle east -- a stand-up uprising , if you will .

and i think that one of the happiest things is the sense that with my children i &apos;ve been able to introduce them into the very small circle of humans who are lucky enough , or possibly stupid enough , to still climb trees .
it &apos;s between buildings .
so the idea was there .
we have information about things like where was it published , who was the author , when was it published .
what i hope you think , is that bacteria can talk to each other , they use chemicals as their words , they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon that we &apos;re just now starting to learn about .
they lack retention ; you find yourself re-explaining concepts three months later , wholesale .
what we found is that these rooms remained relatively stagnant until saturday , when we opened the vents up again .

and my doctor , on a whim , sent me to get a full-body bone scan , which showed that there was some growth in my left leg .
mapping and tagging .
and i think everyone from 1957 totally underestimated the level of technology we would all carry around in our hands and in our pockets today .
so why don &apos;t we have a good theory of brains ?
we &apos;ve got about 75 percent of the fish , maybe as much as 90 percent .
and crocodiles were not behaving at that time either .
it had by no means got the green light yet .
the coveted right-hand page was not given up to the whole issue .
it was , remarkably , a pretty good sounding room .
the only accusation i ever heard leveled at him was when one of our clients said , &quot; solly , you are pathologically helpful . &quot;
and i give you a diamonds , so they -- so you put them here , in a nice row , right . and you can see , yeah ? good .
he showed how all of this can be put together .
now these numbers can be appreciated in many different ways .
what i want to talk to you about today is virtual worlds , digital globes , the 3-d web , the metaverse .
actually , the reason that google was such a success is because they were the first ones to take advantage of the self-organizing properties of the web .
and we think people like this probably don &apos;t want to vote for people who look like this and are named barack obama .
and it accelerates the amount and level of the stimulation .
and we released to youtube this , the virtual choir project , 185 singers from 12 different countries .
and theft of our children &apos;s future would someday be a crime .
we americans bought alaska in the 1850s . it &apos;s called seward &apos;s folly .
and what he &apos;s doing is he &apos;s passing a small magnetic pulse through the skull of the participant in our study into their inferior frontal gyrus .
it becomes a desire , a need , an armor .
so we have countries living there .
it &apos;s actually printing this two chamber heart , one layer at a time .
i feel a little uncomfortable .
the question we had is how could they do anything at all ?
but just to clarify , the 25 billion dollars is gross , right ? that &apos;s gross ?
they know mental as well as physical suffering .
but it &apos;s really a tiny fraction of the size of an atomic nucleus .
so there they are .
and these guys orbited a 30 -- or no , about a 22-mile long asteroid called eros .
and all these stories became part of his memory bank , so he could call on them whenever he needed to .
the fact is , we have an enormous buffer in rich countries between ourselves and hunger .
in closing , and as we &apos;re moving towards the end , i just also want to encourage -- and i &apos;m willing to share my failures as well , though not from the stage .
the way we are doing things now is not the only way they can done , and certainly not the best way they can be done .

cheese ? i love cheese !
its characters are triangles , circles and other geometrical figures , without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it ; without these , one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth . &quot;
when these things die , immediately , organisms come in and encrust and live on that dead surface .
so let me show you something .
i know that one kiss could take away all my decision-making ability .
i want to talk to you today about prosperity , about our hopes for a shared and lasting prosperity .
it &apos;s uncomfortable , but it &apos;s adaptive .
it is this weapon of devastating accuracy and precision .

so , cybercrime , do watch out for it .
fireworks displays , the smell of perfume : no .

one , the numbers you &apos;ll never get to see .
and , we &apos;re just about to announce the zinio reader product that i believe will make magazines even more enjoyable to read .
i said , &quot; pearl necklace ? &quot; &quot; yeah . &quot;
in this case we learned how to detail it .
so i think that actually step two , that i called a step a moment ago , isn &apos;t a step at all .
well you might have , but i don &apos;t think so .
find the truth for yourself , and when you find the truth for yourself , there will be a truth in it , but it may contradict the plot , but don &apos;t worry about it . &quot;
lucy mcrae : how can technology transform the human body ?
it can also be not-for-profit drug development agencies , for example .
now , let &apos;s see what &apos;s happening with babies who became autistic .
after this , they were scientists , professionals with a particular scientific method , goals , societies and funding .
and i &apos;m going to say a few words about each one this morning .
the third one is important because if we think people get used to handouts , it might destroy markets to distribute free bed nets .
for men , shame is not a bunch of competing , conflicting expectations .
so if we take some outbound path -- perhaps we park and we wander off -- we know because our own movements , which we can integrate over this path roughly what the heading direction is to go back .
and that &apos;s why the end of growth is the central issue and the event that we need to get ready for .
the other problem was the suit was so buoyant that they had to strap my feet in to keep me from floating up .
so seeing this in a very simple , dignified way was a very powerful experience .
first is physiological .
what all administrations say when there &apos;s a scandal .
i &apos;m gonna talk a little bit about open-source security , because we &apos;ve got to get better at security in this 21st century .
i have a suggestion .
so our goal is to study how they work , the resources they have access to , so that they can make this product .
okay ? we never would have found those with our obsession with what &apos;s trending now .
all of industry was in play , as investors flocked to place their bets .
and then , after a while , i had to ask myself , &quot; why do we take on knowledge , why do we take on assumptions that other people have given us ? &quot;
some of the other things that they need we &apos;re not very good at giving . maybe nobody is .
but when lindbergh crossed the atlantic , the payload was also just sufficient for one person and some fuel .
so these people , biomimics , are nature &apos;s apprentices .
can we figure out a way , since we know we won &apos;t have enough masks because we don &apos;t make them in america anymore , they &apos;re all made in china -- do we need n95 ? a state-of-the-art , top-of-the-line , must-be-fitted-to-your-face mask ?
i used a microscopic shard of diamond to actually carve the actual base .
this experience taught me to empathize more with my patients , and especially those with retinal diseases .
running horizontally along the graph , is &quot; ecological footprint , &quot; which is a measure of how much resources we use and how much pressure we put on the planet .
those are actually all real butterfly specimens .
they did so illegally .
but with mri data , we can just build the product , as you can see , very intricately .
and it &apos;s the infrastructure that really determines whether this process goes forward .
bottom left , well , there &apos;s no one .
leopard seals , since the time of shackleton , have had a bad reputation .
so this is what i learned .
the payoffs to innovation are greatest where the uncertainty is highest .
but when you think about it , your friends are long-term adventures , and therefore , perhaps the most significant thing you can do to add more years to your life , and life to your years . thank you very much .
it &apos;s called breakbone fever , because that &apos;s how you can feel .
we &apos;ll start here .
and yet , again , you &apos;re not all in one room .
we don &apos;t want to have what there is in the west .
or we can use cells alone , either your very own cells or different stem cell populations .
the coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early , and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state .
this was the thing the feynman diagrams were for .
so , if you look at this image , right away you might be able to see that there are clusters of obese and non-obese people in the image .
robert full and frans lanting and others -- the beauty of the things they showed .
there is two ways to be past-oriented , two ways to be future .
without the pencil , subjects were excellent judges , but with the pencil in their mouth -- when they could not mimic the smile they saw -- their judgment was impaired .
so rick and liz and kevin and i came up with the idea .
within the first second , energy itself shatters into distinct forces including electromagnetism and gravity .
for me , this is about exploring human limits , about exploring the limits of physiology , of psychology and of technology . they &apos;re the things that excite me .
and when it takes its place , it sheds electromagnetic radiation .
so let &apos;s go back even further , to plutarch , who said that , &quot; the mind is not a vessel that needs filling , but wood that needs igniting . &quot;
all that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water , also helps cool our cities .
this can be combined with led lighting as well .
prime numbers , gauss , one of my favorites .
this is what these other cultures demand .
in poland , our pages were named &quot; covers of the year &quot; three times in a row .
could it be that , at the point in time when you need to know something , you can find out in two minutes ?
the first thing to remember is that play is not anarchy .
one part of medicine , though , has faced the problem of behavior change pretty well , and that &apos;s dentistry .
and it &apos;s been used most famously in haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake .
it starts to search for its house in the right distance away from the food , but it is clearly completely lost .
so the list of ingredients does tell you something , and sometimes it tells you something that &apos;s wrong .
i should have one . might come in handy if somebody ever puts a tracking device on my car .
so , this whole area is so fascinating .
in here , i have produce and boxes that are unavoidable .
and especially as suburbia is becoming less centered on the family , the family households , there &apos;s a real hunger for more third places .
these are the galleries with the light coming in through the skylights , and at night , and on opening day .
it was really humbling to see for the first time , to really understand that even if i could have taken a magic wand and fixed everything , i probably would have gotten a lot wrong .
the other thing is , we love batteries .
kevin , can you help ?
in the very short run , you can sometimes fool yourself into thinking that there &apos;s fundamentally opposing goals , but in the long run , ultimately , we &apos;re learning in field after field that this is simply not true .
and the visuals you &apos;re about to see are not prerecorded .
think about what happened .
you pick it up , you put the damn thing back on , and finish the goddamn race ! &quot;
thank you . thank you .
because isn &apos;t that easy ?
nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land .
it &apos;s as big as any of the biggest trees east of the mississippi river , and yet it &apos;s only a minor feature on chronos .
the moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine , you can start shooting at people .
so we have two prototypes .
and i started walking off .
we &apos;re born makers .
i was so determined to be a teacher now so that i could make a difference in my family .
i would also like to tell the world that animals love .
i wish i could do that now .
psychologists have known about the negative consequences of incentivizing everything for 30 years .
our subjects doubled their cheating .

so they &apos;re all using this molecule for interspecies communication .
not a single one of those cells is conscious ; not a single one of those cells knows who you are , or cares .
so think about a cop .

when you do this kind of stuff it &apos;s like doing eva .
it &apos;s written around 1834 , so , even though it &apos;s old , i hope you like it .

the taliban are running suicide schools , preparing a generation of boys for atrocities against civilians .
do you give the nets for free to maximize coverage , or do you make people pay in order to make sure that they really value them ?
the reason it &apos;s different is that , just in the past few years , our machines have started demonstrating skills they have never , ever had before : understanding , speaking , hearing , seeing , answering , writing , and they &apos;re still acquiring new skills .
so , that was noraida , and just like lorraine and everybody else you &apos;re meeting today , these are folks who are based on real people from my real life : friends , neighbors , family members .
could it be there is something more going on here ?
we &apos;re then able to compare the results from that study with real world experience , because we &apos;re putting two of these in hospitals that johns hopkins works with in sierra leone , including the hospital where that emergency c-section happened .
the words on the card describe what will happen inside .
two months ago , i remembered that promise i made , when a distinguished english critic published an article in the london times , asking who could be the winner of the orchestra world cup .

it &apos;s emotional . it &apos;s personal .
it can only be a state of being , not just a fleeting emotion , sensation .
so it &apos;s going to be really important that he be able to drive me around some day .
but i &apos;m going to try and do something different , and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories , and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we &apos;ve been talking about .
i want to demo this actually , because it &apos;s a very simple process .
just imagine that the air surrounding these places -- it &apos;s filled with the residue of explosives and coal .
this building has the ability , in short order , to go back to a flat floor organization such that they can rent it out .
and i said , &quot; if you &apos;re serious , i will try to find a family for her . &quot;
or roger 2.0 .
and i think a lot of people in africa have this different perspective , and i think that &apos;s going to impact technology .
i set that whole thing up .
so thank you and thank you for listening .
well , you know what bovine stercus is ?
and david wanted to carve deeply into brad &apos;s face to bring the aging to this character .
and so it &apos;s not an accident that a great flowering of innovation happened as england switched to tea and coffee .
we know for example that we now have specialized eye trackers and infrared brain scans , mri &apos;s that can decode the signals that our bodies send out when we &apos;re trying to be deceptive .
so i said , &quot; i am dead , so i need to be born again . &quot;
since there was nothing there , you might as well not look .

and being alone is very unnatural to the human .
and if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by george orwell , well it turns out that george orwell was an optimist .
and 10 years ago it seemed like i had a lot of time to convince intel to work on this . right ?
they were singing and dancing .
first , they demoralize the people who are engaged in the activity .
but we &apos;re not content to stop there .
we belong to the family called the hominidae .
and we measured how much they were willing to pay for it .
and i guess i &apos;ll keep investigating until i get the answers .
what is it that makes us capable of supposing anything , and does this tell us anything about what we can suppose ?
and they thought that they clarified the issue , because they &apos;d set out a clear distinction between legal and illegal copying .
and mr. carrillo &apos;s alibi ?
let &apos;s begin with a story .
this e8 pattern has very deep mathematical roots .
it &apos;s a remarkably beautiful landscape . i can &apos;t even begin to describe it to you .
a local official literally prostrated himself in the street , in front of these protesters , in order to get them to go away .
and i see , even more importantly , the power of music to connect hearts .

i want to point out one thing . this is -- you guys know what this is .
this is buster setting up a pull-up machine at the office of his new startup habit labs , where they &apos;re trying to build up other applications like health month for people .
it &apos;ll spread to the entire curve .
here , you can see where punta tombo is , and they breed in incredibly dense colonies .
so when we came back to italy , and one of the things that i remember the most is my family having this hard time to share stories .
if you &apos;re really quick , if you &apos;re really quick -- and i can prove this -- this is half a towel from the dispenser in this building .
what is the ideal balance of human and machine ?
there &apos;s been a strong trend toward miniaturization , better sensitivity , so much so that , a few years ago , a gps tracking device looked like this clunky box to the left of the keys .
with trade , there &apos;s mutual interdependency and mutual gain between parties .
under no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis of whether someone had no arms , no legs -- they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand .

biological yield is really important .
what is iran going to do about its nuclear weapons program ?
no time , unfortunately , to mention those . &quot;
and we invite you to participate . thank you very much .
just me and god-given talent .
how many of you here could describe the sound of a single planet or star ?

nathalie miebach : art made of storms
so what else do you require ?
then he lost his job .
and so i started a collaboration with this person , michael zasloff and thomas fishbein , to look at the microbes that colonized these ilea after they were transplanted into a recipient .
the government , meanwhile , has been acting like santa claus .
and especially if it &apos;s kind of interesting books that you care about , in languages that you can read .

there are beetles that roll little balls of dung great distances across the desert floor to feed to their hatchlings .
the eastern hemlock tree has often been described as the redwood of the east .
so there &apos;s really only one area where we &apos;re near the top , and that &apos;s in failing to give our teachers the help they need to develop their skills .

they survive because medieval scribes copied them and copied them and copied them .
i don &apos;t have a pointer here , but you see the green , sort of rectangle or trapezoid ?
the creator doesn &apos;t have any rights .
the second issue : your country could be under cyberattack with entire regions plunged into total darkness , and you may not even know who &apos;s attacking you .

so the chance that she &apos;s innocent isn &apos;t one in 73 million .
comparing it with a typical building , what happens if we seek to use such design strategies in terms of really large-scale thinking ?
but the interactivity allows the audience to shape what you &apos;re going to do as much as you shape their experience of the world .
i want a house , and i want a car .
and i also bought a laser cutter and started to fabricate within my own shop , kind of , large-scale building elements and models , where we could go directly to the tooling .
if you can convince me we can do all that , then , yes , i would take the two percent .
in the process , i &apos;ve gathered a few fragments that help me shed some light on this puzzle .
and when the woman has male-pattern disease -- so she looks like barbara in the movie -- they get treated .
it &apos;s dna which is pretty badly fragmented , but with good techniques now , you can basically reassemble the whole genome .
this is my grandmother , and this is where i get this mouth .
these transactions create allies , not enemies .

lesley hazleton : on reading the koran
but maybe we can afford to provide each student with a computer or a smartphone .
and so , i &apos;ve got about 20 seconds left , so if i &apos;m going to leave you with anything , last decade was the decade of social .
why ? because as your attention shifts to your cell phone , you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly to the car braking in front of you , and so you &apos;re much more likely to get engaged into a car accident .

it is not the same pattern at two different scales .
and the point of this magazine was to read the articles , listen to the music , and try to interpret it .

this is a scene at base camp , at one of the camps where some of the climbers were lost .
now , how many things are these ?
these devices beat back and forth about 200 hertz during flight , and the animal can use them to sense its body rotation and initiate very , very fast corrective maneuvers .
they know perfectly well , but they have no other choice .
sometimes you just want to stand in the corner and stare out of the window .
i now look at my kitchen , and i bow to it , and i thank my ancestors for coming up with the invention that probably made us humans .
and so clearly they were criminals because of the way they died .
i had an office in those days which bordered a slum , an urban slum , so there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum .
my father has this on his desk , and he sees his grandchildren everyday , changing constantly .
now we &apos;re into a distance sort of between here and here .
and when we gave graduate engineers that question , they said it couldn &apos;t be done .
when i spoke to some printers when i started doing this and told them what i wanted to do , which was to print conductive inks onto paper , they told me it couldn &apos;t be done , again , that kind of favorite thing .
so this was before the computer was invented .
that chin barbel is flashing .
vc : thank you , neil .
we did this experiment with a group of patients who had anterograde amnesia . these are hospitalized patients .
this is where people normally object that it doesn &apos;t sound very sustainable to sail water from copenhagen to china .
i mean , they can do like seven kilometers an hour and sustain it .
eight , nine , 10 .
so , several years ago , i decided to look into the brain and study this madness .
it &apos;s just to tell you that in that red section of the brain stem , there are , to make it simple , all those little squares that correspond to modules that actually make brain maps of different aspects of our interior , different aspects of our body .
it was tracked for 43 days , swimming 1,700 kilometers , or more than 1,000 miles .
why were you all sure that the answer to the question was no , before i &apos;d even told you anything about the context ?
and so , if you think of cancer as a system , there &apos;s an input and an output and a state in the middle .
because liberals like to say , &quot; fetch , please . &quot;
another update : you will recall i introduced you guys to the quadro tracker .
this is a very different demographic .
are we alone in this vast universe of energy and matter and chemistry and physics ?
i am told you will go from here .
that &apos;s all , shukran . thank you very much for the opportunity .
tim jackson : an economic reality check
but if you haven &apos;t played with a battery and a bulb , if you &apos;ve only seen a circuit diagram , you might not be able to do that , and that &apos;s one of the problems .
i had to meet my prime minister .
i think if you treat people well , people will come back and come back for more .
i did not expect to be spending a significant part of my time as a harvard surgeon worrying about checklists .
why have we got 130,000 troops on the ground ?
well , the question with which i &apos;d like to end is this : if we &apos;re so damn stupid , how did we get to the moon ?
see if you can see those waves propagating through the swarm .
but they also have rising costs to our security , economy , health and environment that are starting to erode , if not outweigh their benefits .
at the same time , all of our firepower was impotent when it came to halting or even stemming the slaughter in rwanda , darfur , myanmar .
gene and gail know everyone in atlanta -- they &apos;re the most social couple imaginable .
and i had a mac classic . and it &apos;s a little box .
and when that responsibility is diffused between a whole network of researchers , academics , industry sponsors , journal editors , for some reason we find it more acceptable , but the effect on patients is damning .
so why all the big deal about genetics ?
so you have this little algal forest , and in the size of a laptop you can find more than 100 species of algae , mostly microscopic fit hundreds of species of little animals that then feed the fish , so that the system recovers .
but this part of the equation i didn &apos;t really get , and i don &apos;t think my physicians really get this part of the equation .
well , the answer to that question , and who was really involved and what really happened , well that &apos;s going to probably remain locked away in the secretive company registries of the british virgin islands and elsewhere unless we all do something about it .
all it takes in one person to mess it up .
the infant mortality rate is the highest on this continent and is about three times higher than the u.s. national average .
we &apos;ll have completed the reverse-engineering of the human brain , 1,000 dollars of computing will be far more powerful than the human brain in terms of basic raw capacity .
it &apos;s an old eastern tradition based on the knowledge that it &apos;s not healthy for a human being to spend too much time staring at his own reflection .
so , why -- why and where -- did chop suey come from ?
self-sustaining entities , 18 months return on investment , plus we &apos;re paying people living wage and health benefits , while feeding people for pennies on the dollar .
i &apos;m like , &quot; that &apos;s stupid because you have to work for five hours .
because they were getting it from abroad .
i make a rural woman to compete with multinationals .
well , we said , what if you now send the command to the phantom , but give him visual feedback that it &apos;s obeying his command , right ?
i &apos;m not so old .
i think a great example of this is ethiopia &apos;s new health extension program .
and yet , two hours later you find yourself standing on the roof of this monastery , smeared with mud , blood and sweat .
we brought in rick baker , and rick is one of the great makeup and special effects gurus of our industry .
this is less than a dollar and this is non-stick ; it is coated with one of these food-grade materials .
and the network effects rule , meaning that the more you have , the more you get .
simple .
there &apos;s much more in culture : there &apos;s manuscripts , there newspapers , there &apos;s things that are not text , like art and paintings .
it was said when he got a copy of the king james bible or &quot; aesop &apos;s fables , &quot; he was so excited he couldn &apos;t sleep .
we need incentives . people have to make a living .
and she said maybe part of the reason was it was difficult for her .
this whimsical wrap-up of ted2006 -- presented by einstein , the african grey parrot , and her trainer , stephanie white -- simply tickles . watch for the moment when einstein has a moment with al gore .
around the world today we &apos;re seeing an incredible transformation , from what i would call a biocidal species , one that -- whether we intentionally or unintentionally -- have designed our systems to kill life , a lot of the time .
george bush thought he was going to invade iraq , find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction , liberate the people and bring democracy to the middle east .

i have three more years than i thought .
they don &apos;t spend time alone .
you &apos;ll hear a train in moment that they don &apos;t react to .
one day that eye may be that of an intelligent alien , and the sooner we eschew our narrow view of evolution the sooner we can truly explore our ultimate origins and destinations .
in fact , it was capable of doing everything we do today with computers , only really slowly .
they lie beyond the visible .
the association is very easy : buy green , don &apos;t buy red , think twice about yellow .
he co-wrote a mockumentary about failed superheroes called &quot; super-has-beens . &quot;
so this dung pat was actually -- well , it was a dung pat 15 minutes before this photograph was taken , and we think it &apos;s the intense competition that makes the beetles so well-adapted to rolling balls of dung .
it &apos;s called the other car .
now , i had been working on other topics : the emergence of infectious diseases , which come out of the natural ecosystems of the earth , make a trans-species jump , and get into humans .
and you &apos;ll see , there &apos;s some damage to the surface of the coral .
this shift is the most striking in the u.s. and in the u.k. , but it &apos;s a global phenomenon .

leading the way -- what &apos;s leading the way ?
these robots we &apos;re shipping every day .
but what breaks my heart and what &apos;s alarming is that in those two interviews , the people around , who were interviewed as well , refer to that behavior as talibanization .
but there &apos;s still a sort of filling in , as we can tell if we look at this .
you heard stories earlier today about patients who are taking control of their cases , patients who are saying , &quot; you know what , i know what the odds are , but i &apos;m going to go look for more information .
thank you .
in the health care system , if you touch average , you &apos;re done .
which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue , the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food .
it also recognizes where you &apos;re looking , your head orientation .
help me build this school .
most of them come from very optionless families , not just poor .
now if you look at hong kong , they have a very interesting system called octopus there .
now why do we call david an underdog ?
and i would like to know what the audience is , and so who of you ever ate insects ?
but i want you to take this very seriously .
and the other thing that &apos;s pretty cool about the technology is that it only transfers energy to things that work at exactly the same frequency .
so the most common question i get asked , and i &apos;m going to answer it now so i don &apos;t have to do it over drinks tonight , is how did this come about ?
i think we have three challenges for the future .
and she found the place and decided to go there , went there .
in the experiments i told you about , we have lifted the identity of the critic , but we still have no idea how the critic does its job .
this will linger during the break , so take advantage of the networking opportunities .

some of you remember this , i &apos;m sure .
yet i could see soiled nappies , and i could see that some of the children were distressed , but the only noise was a low , continuous moan .
what &apos;s really important is that the ecx will operate a market information system to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country , using vsat technology to bring an electronic price dissemination directly to farmers .
there are other questions like this , too .
a 400-foot-tall calving face breaking off .
and for those of you in the diaspora who are struggling with where should i be , should i move back , should i stay ?
and these plants need sunlight , so we know when we find that sediment there &apos;s no ice overhead .
it &apos;s almost like the concept of number being developed for symmetry .
a major overhaul of poland &apos;s education helped to dramatically reduce between variability among schools , turn around many of the lowest-performing schools , and raise performance by over half a school year .
in 2008 , it flew for a whopping 20 seconds , a year later , two minutes , then six , eventually 11 .
my parents were radicals -- who became , well , grown-ups .
transferred to a larger scale -- actually a lot larger , with a lot of help -- 14,064 bicycle reflectors -- a 20-day install .
and so along with changing who worked there , you must have come up against another positioning that we always run into , in particular with women , and it has to do with outside image , dress , the veiled woman .

it &apos;s an antidote to the growing tendency we have to feel that we can really ever experience life by watching it on a computer screen , you know , when we &apos;re in a wi-fi zone .
but seriously , seriously , we did get along , because we had a common goal of wanting to inspire these young people .
i want you to examine the shard of glass .
a few years ago , kevin kelly , my partner , and i noticed that people were subjecting themselves to regimes of quantitative measurement and self-tracking that went far beyond the ordinary , familiar habits such as stepping on a scale every day .
so building this complete teacher feedback and improvement system won &apos;t be easy .
and this is codex c here .
remarkably , we find we can completely dissociate these two abnormalities .
ninety-five percent of that land can only feed people from animals .
i grew up with a radio in a car .
remarkable impact on mortality .
this is all i &apos;m asking for really in human decision making , is the consideration of these three things .

and i want to show you one of our tests .
would somebody get us started by giving us a two-digit number please ?

what would they tell us ?
they had expectations for all of the cousins and the extended family of immigrants that lived in the south bronx , but they had more than just expectations for us .

and we have a much longer way to go when it comes to the idea of restoring perfect hearing .
employees volunteer time in the advice booth .
here &apos;s an example of a project using the microphone .
but think about it .

the next morning , i woke up and i was in such a state of depression , and all i could think about was sir ranulph fiennes .
so , i asked the translator why she thought she was dying .

when we walked through the savanna a thousand years ago we made linear predictions where that animal would be , and that worked fine . it &apos;s hardwired in our brains .
is fission kind of played out , or is there something left to innovate here ?

so , the tiger is the icon .
now , where is it ?
the guy went up and started dickering , and 10 dollars later , we had four camels .
and again , i couldn &apos;t go . but it &apos;s a fascinating group . they make balloon animals .
all the major religions give us calendars .
perhaps even worse is when it finds its way into our oceans , like in the great plastic gyre , where these materials are being mechanically broken into smaller and smaller bits , but they &apos;re not really going away .
that &apos;s a 2,000 mile journey .
33 percent of all of our regrets pertain to decisions we made about education .
there is a world of interesting things inside your dishwasher .
and this takes the long-term steady courage of the day-in day-out struggle to educate , to persuade and to win acceptance .
and this idea , again , came from the grassroots , from two googlers who wrote their own job descriptions and volunteered themselves for the job .
for example , i took a whole bunch of fortune cookies back to china , gave them to chinese to see how they would react .
i was hyperventilating so much , and within seconds my hands were numb .
what we can see here is the metal sheet , this time connected to a sound driver and being fed by a frequency generator .
and if i ask you which of these you find more beautiful , you &apos;re probably drawn to the lower two .
now , we &apos;re not saying don &apos;t help africa .
they want us to fit in even better .
there we go . okay .
let &apos;s start with the world of 1945 .

that &apos;s how you assert yourself .
and the government research bureau brought representatives together and told them that this is something that has to be done .
since we &apos;ve correctly calculated the area two different ways , they have to be the same number , and that &apos;s why the squares of one , one , two , three , five and eight add up to eight times 13 .

james surowiecki : the power and the danger of online crowds
how many people know about xml ?

both have a side benefit , which is that we reduce pesticide use tremendously .
every city determines to a very large extent the amount of energy used by its inhabitants .
we scaled the building up three times to chinese proportions , and went to china .
which means that the mystery of explaining the amount of dark energy we &apos;ve now measured would take on a wholly different character .

but it &apos;s the living room .
dj : and in fact , that original thing that we spoke about and designed our lives by -- that conservation was all about respect and celebration -- is probably true . that &apos;s really what it needs .

and it doesn &apos;t matter if what they teach them is old , because what you &apos;re doing is you &apos;re lighting the spark .
in other words , as i might seek to demonstrate , if you could achieve the impossible , the equivalent of perpetual motion , you could design a carbon-free house , for example .
and we used these questions : share some of your life experiences with me .
they started to build flyovers to get from a to b faster , but they effectively went from one area of relative wealth to another area of relative wealth .
you cant hit your elbow on bottom .
i &apos;ve gotten into some trouble in silicon valley for saying that the patient in the bed has almost become an icon for the real patient who &apos;s in the computer .
and they &apos;re always wrong , always hilariously , optimistically wrong .
the only thing they don &apos;t expect is they &apos;re uniting europe through a shared mild hatred of the french and germans .
now when people ask this kind of question , they neglect something , which is that physicists are really clever , unlike biologists .
a tiny little sliver call themselves libertarians , or socialists , or some other small third party , and the largest block , 40 percent , say they &apos;re independents .
but we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out .
that was an incredible moment .
here , i &apos;m explaining how a computer uses the grammar of english to parse sentences , and here , there &apos;s a pause and the student has to reflect , understand what &apos;s going on and check the right boxes before they can continue .
in other words , that risk on the quarter acre needed to be repaid in a single harvest , or else they wouldn &apos;t take the risk .

so back in 1997 , i was asked to see this young boy , perfectly normal . he has this genetic form of dystonia .
it &apos;s a genetic disorder , and it involves a twisting motion , and these children get progressively more and more twisting until they can &apos;t breathe , until they get sores , urinary infections , and then they die .
but even if you look across the mood music in europe of late , far-right fascism is also on the rise .
it &apos;s extremely hard to move from one planet to another .
important ? not so very .
what you &apos;re looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium , a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean , named vibrio fischeri .
we work closely with companies that have operational capacity , or nonprofits that have operational capacity .
i thought i would think about changing your perspective on the world a bit , and showing you some of the designs that we have in nature .

can we be the surgeons of our classrooms ?
bipin desai is a u.c. riverside theoretical physicist who also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve got a tasting coming up where we &apos;re going to serve the &apos; 47 cheval blanc . &quot;
you &apos;ll been engulfed by a red giant . &quot;
how can we take this idea of tricking your tastebuds and leapfrog it into something that we can do today that could be a disruptive food technology ?
however , recently this risd opportunity kind of arose -- going to risd -- and i couldn &apos;t reconcile this real easy , because the letters had told me , mit forever .

i really honestly believe that the basic problem here is pure depression , and all of the obsessional thinking comes out of it .
and we can scale this model .
but if you get one person to do step one and one person to do step two and step three and so on , production can increase tremendously .
and then the next thing that i needed was a makeover .
so the next day , you know , after i thought , &quot; well , he might be right . &quot;
we have the people so we need to protect each other , yes , and we &apos;re a technology company , and profit is necessary to make this happen .
he sees an intruder in his territory , and it &apos;s coming all the time and he &apos;s there , so there is no end to it .

she thought my side beat up on her side way more often , that we called them brainless , gun-toting racists , and we both marveled at the labels that fit none of the people we actually know .
because the fur-to-wingspan ratio of the bumblebee is far too large for it to be able to fly .
it &apos;s very hard to know , by the way , what it is you take for granted .
and here , length of life , life expectancy , 30 , 40 , 50 .
i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game .
because who wants the fertilizer factory that makes natural gas ?
the rumors of its demise are always greatly exaggerated .
you directly observe a few simple things .
voice 1 : it &apos;s coming again . voice 2 : new wave ?
it means that when we look at people and see a person from africa and a person from europe or asia , we cannot , for a single position in the genome with 100 percent accuracy , predict what the person would carry .
this is only one variable .
but while in oakland , i &apos;ve really been struck by how much the city of oakland changed as i lost my sight .
i thought it might be interesting , even for the many long-time collectors here with us at ted , local collectors , to have an outside view of 10 young indian artists i wish everyone at ted to know .

the &quot; graph &apos;g-beam turn on . &quot; this next slide , that &apos;s the -- as far as i know -- the first digital bitmap display , 1954 .
let &apos;s go to 40,000 years before the present , to the time of the cultural explosion , when music , art , technology , so many of the things that we &apos;re enjoying today , so many of the things that are being demonstrated at ted were born .
and i &apos;m really here to talk about design .
there is a problem with vaccines around the world not getting to patients . and the reason is that the refrigeration somehow gets broken ; what &apos;s called the &quot; cold chain &quot; gets broken .

paul and anne ehrlich &apos;s environmental impact equation : i is equal to p times a times t : population , affluence and technology .

hello . this is keith bellows with the national geographic camel investigation unit .
jacqueline novogratz tells a moving story of an encounter in a nairobi slum with jane , a former prostitute , whose dreams of escaping poverty , of becoming a doctor and of getting married were fulfilled in an unexpected way .
but there is a better translation .
what are the messages we tell the women who work with and for us ?
thank you .
but in the third great arena of life , love , len is an abysmal failure .
so that &apos;s sort of what we expect .
and my little idea that will do that is sleep .
it &apos;s a study of some bondage techniques , which are actually very , very important because it &apos;s hit by wind all the time .
or you &apos;ve been putting government or scientific data online , i just wanted to take this opportunity to say : thank you very much , and we have only just started !
now , as much fun as it is to discover these patterns , it &apos;s even more satisfying to understand why they are true .
if you want to design from scratch virtually any service in africa , you would start now with the mobile phone .
talk about evil prevailing . i mean , here he was in the room with the embodiment of evil in cambodia .
i want you to notice the scale on the slide , because when you see the same picture from the 1980s , we see the fish are much smaller and we &apos;re also seeing a change in terms of the composition of those fish .
well as you know , genes , which are part of the dna , they &apos;re instructions to make a protein that does something .
and an expo is a totally bonkers thing .
it &apos;s made out of ice .
you see , technology is a way to evolve the evolution .
and so when 425 million people finally won the right to choose their own governments , i was ecstatic , but i was also a touch worried about some of the nastier things lurking behind the wall .
there i go .
very confused at what we humans call justice .
and he goes , &quot; right , that &apos;s life too . i know that . &quot;
and here &apos;s his second bit of advice .
that &apos;s our modest role . we cannot change these societies , but we can help the people in these societies who are struggling and usually failing , because the odds are so stacked against them .
our vision is local manufacturing , like the local food movement , for production .
so , you know , the thing is to remember that because otherwise , 10 years from now , we &apos;ll be back here trying to tell this story again .
well , what we &apos;ve shown is that , first of all , we can actually give the monkeys a financial currency , and they do very similar things with it .
and the only other option open to them is to stop asking the questions .
one of them is winning the lottery . this is about 314 million dollars .
this is two weeks ago in ccp in coventry , who build parts for bentleys and so on .

many of you may remember the magic wall that we built in conjunction with perceptive pixel where we quite literally create an infinite wall .
but there is a difference between the two , because with your ipod you can tell -- or your iphone , you can tell exactly what the time is , with precision .
they just gained a new confidence .
and 50 percent of the eu budget is going to subsidize agriculture from mountains of stuff that people have overproduced .
yami told us at that first meeting , there &apos;s no money .
first , a video .
so , what do we do now ?

so we &apos;re very much a part of the solution as well as the problem .
the vent community animals can &apos;t really do much about the life and death that &apos;s going on where they live , but up here we can .
they drink the water they know is dirty , they get cholera , they get diarrhea , they get jaundice and they die .
and i took over the organization four years ago and really focused it on developing products that actually reach users , and not just any users , but customers who live on less than four dollars a day .
that there are ideas that all of us are enthralled to , which we simply take for granted as the natural order of things , the way things are .
but there were others around me who weren &apos;t even cowering .
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been building the suburbs with a lot of unintended consequences .
which actually helps you run the whole timers , and it lets you figure out what &apos;s going on .
i &apos;m obviously not going to be able to do that for you today , so let me just present to you two headlines as an illustration of what i have in mind .
ok , and only when you feel the pressure go back , i want you to allow your hand to slowly drift back to the tabletop , but only when you feel the pressure .

now , the question i &apos;m going to put to you is whether you think there are more dogs or pigs on leashes observed in any particular day in oxford .

and there is thousands of these .
let &apos;s see how the photo ran in an orthodox jewish newspaper based in brooklyn .
this is hermann goering .
here &apos;s a scene that shows you the balloon and the payload end-to-end .

they don &apos;t know who was an ally of america in world war ii .
now we have really made use of this , and we have tried to squeeze a lot of data into the system .
we know it was that big because of the impact it had and the crater it left .
and you can actually make plastic from obviously oils which come from plants , but also from starches .
i &apos;ve stitched euclid &apos;s parallel postulate on to the surface .
based on these findings , i have a question for you .
while in iran at the same time abololo -- of course a nickname -- has pasted one single face of a woman to show his resistance against the government .
this is a project called flight patterns .
but well , i &apos;m feeling good right now .
even larger animals eat insects .
these are very powerful technologies .
to be a man means not to be a girl .
and it is even used for sensitive issues such as building awareness around gender-based violence .
so this is a series i &apos;m hoping to have ready in about two or three years , under the heading of &quot; the oil party . &quot;
because i can &apos;t explain otherwise , when i look at the figures , what &apos;s going on .
but i know she will anyway , so instead i &apos;ll always keep an extra supply of chocolate and rain boots nearby , because there is no heartbreak that chocolate can &apos;t fix .
and i think it &apos;s very tempting to , in a way , seduce ourselves -- as architects , or anybody involved with the design process -- that the answer to our problems lies with buildings .
geology has these effects , which is moving the plates around and so forth .
and i just want to thank everybody for coming .
there were five different kinds of thylacines in those ancient forests , and they ranged from great big ones to middle-sized ones to one that was about the size of a chihuahua .
most of my childhood was spent playing with legos .
and we didn &apos;t like that , so we actually , in maybe a couple of weeks , we built these little enclosures that enclosed the projectors , and so we can leave them on all the time and they &apos;re completely silent .
we &apos;ve been able to see every single nerve .
in a series of shows that includes &quot; 100 percent vancouver , &quot; &quot; 100 percent berlin , &quot; rimini protokoll makes shows that actually reflect society .
there &apos;s a hole at the front , and there &apos;s a reason for that .
but the problem is that it &apos;s a really ugly patty .
jacqueline novogratz : invest in africa &apos;s own solutions
so , they &apos;re learning from each other . and research bears this out .
i &apos;ve got a little video to show you , but keep in mind that this is with no electronic control , and this is also with only four leds .
and we are able to use this money for many things : very importantly , we put it in education .
stop global warming ; use condoms .
and that &apos;s the stealing cards , which i did .
they develop -- you can see on the far right one where it seems to just stack on top of each other , room , after room , after room .

now , this one &apos;s pretty cool .
what they have in common is what we see unlocks what we cannot see .
the air temperature was not too high , but it was not comfortable during these games .

it &apos;s almost like you can see them learning over those last 10 problems .
now as you &apos;re reading , however , you will be maybe surprised that you will quickly become numb to the numbers of deaths , because you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers of faceless , nameless dead people .
i mean that we have mathematically consistent theories that were actually introduced to explain a completely different phenomenon , ok , things that i haven &apos;t even talked about , that each predict the existence of a very weakly interacting , new particle .
so this actually has given rise to a really big internet meme that tens of thousands of people have participated in , which is called captcha art .
so you &apos;re kind of trying to say , &quot; people of iran , this is your destiny , lets go there . &quot;

&quot; well , you can &apos;t clearcut with a ... &quot;
the destabilizing effects of hunger are known throughout human history .
you know , you can tell -- and i think when we &apos;re getting into collective play , its really important for groups to gain a sense of safety through their own sharing of play signals .
because we &apos;ve got to stop , we &apos;ve got to do something where we unite -- separate from all the politics and religion that , as a young person , is confusing me .
those hearing parents tend to try to cure them .
if that does not survive , i &apos;m not the thing giving this talk .
and most of these levers have popularity problems , and if there is a lever you don &apos;t like the use of , well please do bear in mind that means you need even stronger effort on the other levers .
it just affects the payback period if you &apos;re comparing to grid-supplied electricity .
one for extracting oxygen out of the deep-sea water , another one which houses this chemosynthetic bacteria , which takes the hydrothermal fluid -- that hot water that you saw coming out of the bottom -- and converts that into simple sugars that the tube worm can digest .
are we guilty , as chimamanda adichie reminded us at the ted conference in oxford , of assuming that there is a single story of women &apos;s struggles for their rights while there are , in fact , many ?
they &apos;re actually developing a lot of their science and engineering curriculum to spread widely around the world in our system and they &apos;re also trying to develop all of their software tools completely open-source .
so , i went to the museum of natural history , and i checked out the bones , and i went to the gift shop , and i bought a book .
and from that point on i started thinking , are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong in this particular decision , or is it a more general case ?
and then a bbc crew came cruising through the biology department , looking for a story to do about new technologies in biology .
and i think that &apos;s some of the fear that we see about jobs disappearing from artificial intelligence and robots .
and then finally , having done all that , you &apos;ve now told me the whole thing , so now you &apos;ve got to bring it back to that conclusion .
so i tend to avoid that .
unfortunately , there &apos;s one group of people who get almost no systematic feedback to help them do their jobs better , and these people have one of the most important jobs in the world .

a smoldering grief .
i think it &apos;s because there &apos;s an imbalance , an asymmetry , in the way we treat creative , emotionally-driven psychological ideas versus the way we treat rational , numerical , spreadsheet-driven ideas .
we do have artists , but unfortunately we have not discovered them yet .
or immediately afterward , the han dynasty , still 2,000 years ago .
these nano-bots i mentioned will first be used for medical and health applications : cleaning up the environment , providing powerful fuel cells and widely distributed decentralized solar panels and so on in the environment .
jm : you might also want to have a look at this particular n-gram , and that &apos;s to tell nietzsche that god is not dead , although you might agree that he might need a better publicist .
it was always part of how they looked at the world . and that &apos;s what &apos;s really powerful .

broccoli is not a chinese vegetable ; in fact , it is originally an italian vegetable .
lyn gardner in the guardian has written that a great festival can show us a map of the world , a map of the city and a map of ourselves , but there is no one fixed festival model .

shortly after the tsunami i read a newspaper article written by the archbishop of canterbury -- fine title -- about the tragedy in southern asia .
his name is jesse sullivan .
but today i believe finally infrastructure is something which is agreed upon and which people want to implement .
i want you to remember that to create life &apos;s very diverse and complex forms , life uses computation to do that .
and to carry on with a theme that we &apos;ve already touched with is how nature is related to architecture .

as you can see , he &apos;s looking at the moment . he &apos;s got a little grimace on his face .
so clearly there is some effect .
we have our friend the domestic chicken .
and what &apos;s really neat about it -- well , actually , this all looks like nano-artwork , but it turns out that nano-artwork is just what you need to make nano-circuits .
imagine that snobbery is a distinctively u.k. phenomenon fixated on country houses and titles .
we found this last year .
sylvia &apos;s interested in art training .
now , this is a spectroscope , ok , on my laboratory bench .
and you answer my objection .
and everyone goes , &quot; great ! &quot; he leaves the country and the french and the germans go , &quot; no , no , forget about that , absolutely not . &quot; nothing happens . he goes to strasburg .

i was able to morph the culture into a non-sporulating form .
in theater , you have the character and the actor in the same place , trying to negotiate each other in front of an audience .
i &apos;ve discovered these people , who , in v-day world , we call vagina warriors .
we are left with this missing space of increased deaths the further north you go .
i &apos;m a farm boy . i grew up surrounded by animals , and i would look in these eyes and wonder what was going on there ?
hopefully very soon we will be there , because we are destined , obsessed with making it real .
there &apos;s also a weather goddess who controls a random stock market and random weather .
it &apos;s deeply embedded in the brain .
today , viruses are a global problem .
a single strand dipped in water that completely self-folds on its own into the letters m i t.
now in the extraordinary time that we have worked with legadema -- which is really over a five-year period -- 10,000 leopards were legally shot by safari hunters .
its head is down . it &apos;s walking backwards .
now to be clear , we &apos;re not quite ready to do this .
there &apos;s millions connected .
and i have a copy .
thank you .
what didn &apos;t work well ? our math sheets , or greeting visitors at the door .
but in fact , it was just coming up -- it was the nighttime ; the daytime temperatures didn &apos;t go up .
then you see his left leg .
so gneezy and rustichini said , &quot; how many instances of late pick-ups are there at these 10 daycare centers ? &quot;
age as pathology .
perhaps we are ready for something literally and figuratively more cultured .
i can hardly find the words to describe the peace i felt when i was acting .
this is a very important thing to know about people .
then i first took this job in hamburg , at an art pottery where everything was done on the wheel , and so i worked in a shop where there were several potters .
and of course , when it comes to cognitive effects , &quot; use it or lose it &quot; applies , so you want to stay mentally stimulated .
i think we live in a society which has simply pegged certain emotional rewards to the acquisition of material goods .
( audience : i just wanted to ask you , when we wear seatbelts we don &apos;t necessarily wear them just to prevent loss of life , it &apos;s also to prevent lots of serious injury .
so we start off the story with ernest , who volunteers as a census taker .
so i &apos;m thinking , &quot; mr. huf isn &apos;t going to be very happy when i told him his house has gone to another , into the atmosphere somewhere . &quot;
it &apos;s about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference .
just wait over there .
so right before the revolution we said that egyptians had never felt worse about their lives , but not only that , they thought their future would be no better .
how hard is it going to be to find life on mars ?
and there &apos;s a lot of rewards in thinking about complexity and emergence , not so much in thinking about simplicity .
but for another client in another culture , it could really be the right answer to a different question .
it looks like women got some power boost on a video game , or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills that lets them shoot up high .
and so , whereas dr. oliver sacks has talked about how perhaps one person in a million actually has true synesthesia , where they hear colors or taste shapes , and things like this , phonaesthesia is something we can all experience to some extent .
from just an idea that sounded crazy , you have the largest encyclopedia in the world .
because , when people heard that my son was a victim , i got immediate sympathy .
how may know somebody like this ? come on .
this is daniel ; he &apos;s one of our students in arctic village , alaska .
there &apos;s no democracy worth the name that doesn &apos;t have a transparency move , but transparency is openness in only one direction , and being given a dashboard without a steering wheel has never been the core promise a democracy makes to its citizens .
cool roofs are highly reflective surfaces that don &apos;t absorb solar heat and pass it on to the building or atmosphere .
now , to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life , for human beings , we know that there is a continuum of such facts .
&quot; sputnik &quot; was downtown , the negative . it wasn &apos;t touched .
people just go because it &apos;s pleasurable to be there .
if i show another aspect of that technology then , in a completely different context -- this apartment building in the alps in switzerland .
it gives us a little bit of justin bieber and a little bit of afghanistan .
okay , so frieda is my dead skeleton .
tell them this story . convince them to tell the story to another two persons .
and probably a whole bunch of trees as well .
and what those four chemicals do is they take any cell and take it way back up the mountain so it can become any body part .
well , that &apos;s pretty amazing .
and so what do the monkeys do ?
everybody wanted their deposit back . everybody is fleeing .
so when you do this , and when you plot the data , you pretty quickly come to some weird conclusions .
the animals are simply gone .
and i &apos;d like to talk about some of those just for the next few minutes .
i had so many surgeries to put my neck back together , to repair my heart a few times .
very -- one of the top popular singers in england today , katie melua .
still has the tag in it from me buying it , so i can take it back to the shop if she didn &apos;t like it .
how would i know what i was doing differently ?
oliver sacks : what hallucination reveals about our minds
did you know that we americans have about three times the amount of space we did 50 years ago ?
and if had been a horror movie , people in the audience would have started saying , &quot; don &apos;t go in there . don &apos;t go in there . &quot;
we have to change it so that the country is strong and stays at the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education , like science and mathematics .
that &apos;s bad news for us too .
the smoking debate took 40 years , and that was an easy one .
and you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse -- even when it &apos;s pretty old , like age 60 for a human , that old for a mouse -- if you give the mouse rapamycin , it will live longer .
and i &apos;m just going to zip through these slides .
pretty powerful .
james stavridis : a navy admiral &apos;s thoughts on global security
but that &apos;s not really true : you can be a serious professional adult and , at times , be playful .
is matter evolvable ?
aubrey de grey : my name &apos;s aubrey de grey , from cambridge .
let me talk about my own experience .
now this is a totally reasonable assumption , given that i have made quite a habit of encouraging people to spend more time playing games .
because your choice now is either i use my own needle now , or i could share a needle now and get a disease that &apos;s going to possibly kill me 10 years from now , or i could use my own needle now and go to jail tomorrow .
so , what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve succeeded in making something much bigger than a dna origami by combining dna origami with tiles .
free is probably the most interesting thing .
we did it so fast we weren &apos;t prepared for their collapse .
so , he &apos;d taken this data and made a presentation which just shattered a lot of myths that people had about the economics in the developing world .
this is what our summum bonum is .
it turns out there &apos;s an enormous amount of information already available on that subject , which is the mars rover problem .
so in america , it was kind of ridiculous that they said i should go to high school .
on the left there is the packbot from irobot .
why don &apos;t we control for other factors ?
in 1986 , i moved to rwanda , and i worked with a very small group of rwandan women to start that country &apos;s first microfinance bank .
and i love you , and i &apos;ll always be with you .
if you think about it , if you want to live in a world in the future where there are fewer material goods , you basically have two choices .
we all know that the internet has shrunk space as well as time .
i think we all -- if we don &apos;t look in the data -- we underestimate the tremendous change in asia , which was in social change before we saw the economical change .
okay .
but eventually , no matter how good you are at digging up the church records , and all that stuff , you hit what the genealogists call a brick wall .
this was the economic level at which sweden was .
and then i got this image in my head of what would happen if you yanked the wire from the wall and if you started to follow it . where would it go ?
in fact , the story holds true even if you have a person who got sight after several years of deprivation .
it &apos;s the precise amount of harm that comes to media companies whenever a single copyrighted song or movie gets pirated .
i don &apos;t believe it and i think this idea , popular as it is -- not in this guise but in general -- is itself one of the main problems that we face .
what would our ancestors 10,000 years ago have said if they really had technology assessment ?
so thank you . thank you , thomas . you &apos;re a delight .
i &apos;ll talk you through one example , and that &apos;s the example that everyone here will be aware of , and that &apos;s the example of al-qaeda .
and this is the weight of all air and land vertebrates .
how powerful would our world be if we had kids who were not afraid to take risks , who were not afraid to think , and who had a champion ?
beau lotto : optical illusions show how we see
when i was a young child , my mother , who was a choreographer , came upon a phenomenon that worried her .
how could it ever be adaptive for any organism to overcome self-interest ?
you know , andy grove stepped down as chairman of the board at intel -- and andy was one of my mentors , tough individual .
another , different kind of poem of youth and age .
this is benki .
it has a magnetic quality that draws me in .
i have , like , a thing about sleeping .
and that makes us larger than the u.s. as a telephone market .
and so you can actually sort of almost double your boat speed with systems like that . so that &apos;s sort of another interesting aspect of the future .
this may , we &apos;re going to go from minus 1,000 meters in zacaton , and if we &apos;re very lucky , depthx will bring back the first robotically-discovered division of bacteria .
now , that played itself out in the world cup campaign .
hi there .
so it was a little discouraging to the students .
it &apos;s a way to create new rules , and let people opt-in without coercion , and the opposition that coercion can force .
but can you sustain your company that way ?
ultimately , when we get it right , reputation capital could create a massive positive disruption in who has power , trust and influence .
and thank you chemical processing industry that gave us time to read books . &quot;
i remember that scene like it was yesterday ; i was 16 , i was in tears , i was in the closet , and i &apos;m looking at these two people , ferris bueller and some guy i &apos;d never seen before , fighting for love .
but i &apos;m going see what happens if i press this button .
so i traveled to boston , to cambridge , and i went to this wonderful ig nobel prize ceremony held at harvard university , and this ceremony is a very nice experience .
so we are trying to wipe out this virus completely .
i talk to him for hours .
but it turns out that in 1918 that was not the case at all .
our hands are amazing instruments .
interviewer : right . so if we get on it , we should be able to wobble it , yes ?
and everybody outside thought we were dying .
and i &apos;ll never forget hearing that story from dr. rachel naomi remen , who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her , that in the beginning of the creation something happened and the original light of the universe was shattered into countless pieces .
we have to come and attack this problem with a focus , with an effort that actually says , we &apos;re going to go to zero before the world ends .
we have opportunities in agriculture , like i said .
this is a drug called tamiflu . tamiflu is a drug which governments around the world have spent billions and billions of dollars on stockpiling , and we &apos;ve stockpiled tamiflu in panic , in the belief that it will reduce the rate of complications of influenza .
and aggregated , these smaller interceptions could actually infiltrate all the roadborne pollution that now runs into the estuary system , up to a seven inch rain event , up to a hundred-year storm .
let me give you an even more radical example of it : something called the results only work environment , the rowe , created by two american consultants , in place in place at about a dozen companies around north america .
if you want to take the game around the world , it &apos;s got to be the shortest form of the game .
but these localized rituals become pan-andean , and these fantastic festivals , like that of the qoyllur rit &apos;i , which occurs when the pleiades reappear in the winter sky .
the children are virtual prisoners ; they cannot leave , they cannot go home .
and then we apply all these other principles like transparency , professional management , measurable results , scalability , &#91; unclear &#93; , etc .
bf : yeah , it &apos;s all right .
and he invited us in particular because we have a very specific type of design process -- one that results in appropriate design solutions in places that don &apos;t usually have access to design services or creative capital .
whales also have contact calls like i described for the dolphins .
you &apos;re looking at a great example here .
so , these are the words i am waiting to hear , but from my son , not my daughter .
you start off at 11,500 feet .
and believe me , these are current pictures .
in a country of a billion people and some , why so few ?
somebody is camping in your head .
oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day , plus another four billion dollars a day in hidden economic and military costs , raising its total cost to over a sixth of gdp .
so this is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging .
of course , it &apos;s going to empower whoever is most skilled at using the technology and best understands the internet in comparison with whoever their adversary is .
those of you who changed your mind in favor of &quot; for &quot; put your hands up .
the other problem is they &apos;re right in the ozone layer , and i &apos;d prefer them above the ozone layer .
but actually , before placing the scaffold into the patient , we actually exercise it .
now talking about e.t. putting us there , or some other life , just pushes the problem further on .
fourteen minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and generous people who fought with me and for me and who waited to welcome me back from that agonized , lonely place .
and i thought that was incredibly peculiar .
but first of all , i want you to do me a favor .
the environmental protection agency even classified this group as a top-priority pollutant because it &apos;s been shown to cause cancer and birth defects by acting as a hormone disruptor .
but they said , &quot; you guys , you think that soldiers who are dying are not important , and your animals you are protecting are most important .
the first has to do with memory , that we can find these moments .
you and everyone else . this is the safe way to drive .
in somalia , the central government collapsed and clan warfare broke out .
you can get more bang for your buck , let &apos;s say .
so that means that the normal function of this hormone receptor is to speed up aging .
now , it &apos;s not without its problems .
many years ago , when i was a young congressman , i spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge of nuclear arms control -- the nuclear arms race .
our industrial society is scarcely 300 years old .
but there &apos;s also a downside to this -- a kind of dark side , in fact -- and that is that the more tightly linked we &apos;ve become to each other , the harder it is for each of us to remain independent .
research and ethics committee : if you want to do anything new in surgery , you have to get a license from your local research and ethics .
how about counting every calorie ?
and it &apos;s only a few months since governments injected enormous sums of money to try and keep the whole system afloat .
i &apos;m going to show you something a bit weird now .
a famous one , it &apos;s called the &quot; sevenfold causal method of developing compassion . &quot;
it &apos;s a way to bring power to the developing world , because it &apos;s produced in a factory and it &apos;s cheap .
this was my mental model of the world : exploding population , small planet ; it &apos;s going to lead to ugly things .
so when i look around , i think the day is not too far off at all when we &apos;re going to have androids doing a lot of the work that we are doing right now .
here &apos;s what newton himself said : &quot; nature is very consonant and conformable to her self . &quot;
he wonders , &quot; if my geologists don &apos;t know where the gold is , maybe somebody else does . &quot;
and we &apos;re going to be talking about 600 , 700 people . &quot;
but more significantly , they gave me the ability to believe , totally , to believe that i could .
this is that great big secret . because the internet provides this level playing field .
imagine what happens when the cost of getting information from anywhere to anywhere is close to zero .
ep : okay , osorio , thank you very much .
you can see that the health started to improve .
and he took me through specific examples of when he really needed it .
so we started out trying to figure out . how do we get to 10 cents ?
the nuclear waste typically goes into a dry cask storage out back of the parking lot at the reactor site because most places don &apos;t have underground storage yet .
that &apos;s understandable , but our experience with met suggests that if teachers manage the process , if they collect video in their own classrooms , and they pick the lessons they want to submit , a lot of them will be eager to participate .
europa is so far away that even at the speed of light , it would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle .
you know , you create power , then you tame it .
just when they stop needing our help taking a bath , they need our help dealing with cyberstalking or bullying .
in the first phase of development we were really enthused by all the things we could control with our mind .
what i &apos;m searching for is a durable mutation -- that &apos;s what all of us are searching for .
the vast majority of economists -- it is so uncool to call yourself an ideologue of either camp .
and now there &apos;s smoke and flames coming by our windows -- we &apos;re on the eleventh floor .
now , let &apos;s see the surfaces according to the quality of light that they reflect .
i &apos;m always thinking , &quot; how could i be more successful ? &quot;
it &apos;s not about low cost .
and the box has two knobs .
is that visible ? what i &apos;d like to talk about is one-sided things .
now that is less than a year old , in an operating room .
this is the breakdown product of the bedrock , that organisms are busy munching their way through .
what a coincidence !
but that &apos;s the lectures .
so here &apos;s an example . i &apos;ll use a figure eight , tracing out a figure eight as an example .
and there &apos;s some evidence that they are .
so what does all this add up to ?
now we can compare this to cutting-edge human performance .
the schools need you . the teachers need you .
you know , orion facing the roaring bull .
in so doing , i reached a frontier of biology so strange , so rich , that it seemed as though it exists on another planet .
and do you ever say , &quot; no , no i &apos;m not going to . &quot;
&quot; no ... not at all . &quot;
his grandfather died when he was only 10 .
and it goes like this .
what if morals , what if what makes something moral is just a matter of if it maximizes pleasure and minimizes pain ?
i can release my wing when i am in a spin or unstable .
so that was the idea .
the americans have even recognized it , in an agreement .
and it also supports working-class kids going into indian schools .
but ultimately , what is a story ? it &apos;s a contradiction .
so if i can make an analogy , let &apos;s say that you were trying to tell the difference between a good restaurant , a healthy restaurant and a sick restaurant , and all you had was the list of ingredients that they had in their larder .
you &apos;ve never seen data presented like this . with the drama and urgency of a sportscaster , statistics guru hans rosling debunks myths about the so-called &quot; developing world . &quot;
we get the generators from the companies .
they spent the 1990s working the messy scene between globalized parts of the world what i call the core and the gap .
we have a brain for one reason and one reason only , and that &apos;s to produce adaptable and complex movements .
thank you .
see any common themes ? principles ?
and here we suddenly begin to have a mapping between curvature that we can exploit numerically , a relative mapping between curvature and shape .
if you take the obese mouse and give it an angiogenesis inhibitor , it loses weight .
so that &apos;s push pop press &apos; first title , al gore &apos;s &quot; our choice . &quot;
and of course , i went to see the rebels in the north .
it &apos;s a global trance .
and if the numbers coming in from china are anything like what they look like now , it &apos;s not going to be 40 years .
the growth of the auto industry will be capped by sustainability issues if we don &apos;t solve the problems .
and that proportion is primarily genetically determined .
thank you .
and people would drive up next to me and say , &quot; john , what are you doing ? &quot;
we did our first million-dollars-worth of trade by buying on 30 days and selling on 21 .
if god is a bystander , observing but not involved , then god may well exist , but we don &apos;t want to know about him .
because without that , you can &apos;t have this kind of place , food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape , and is not just a zero-sum commodity off in some unseen hell-hole .
all they needed to do that more quickly and to do it better was a little bit of capital .
we have about 500 people around the world working in our aids program , some of them for nothing -- just for transportation , room and board .
and then we realized our probe was made out of the same stuff -- it could have melted . but it turns out the exiting temperature was 650 degrees f , hot enough to melt lead .
first thing is that the global nuclear weapons , in the stockpiles that i showed you in those original maps , happen to be not uniformly secure .
it &apos;s a virtuous cycle , and one that could be replicated throughout the developing world .
oh , my god .
so , the holy grail for neuroscience is really to understand the design of the neocoritical column -- and it &apos;s not just for neuroscience ; it &apos;s perhaps to understand perception , to understand reality , and perhaps to even also understand physical reality .
the biggest change for me was that the world moved forward , that there were innovations and all kinds of new things -- cellphones , laptops , all these things that i had never seen before .
this pictograph by the jokwe people of angola tells the story of the creation of the world .
you send in a picture of your cat if it looks like hitler .
however , it would be better if we could boost up a couple of the other senses like smell and taste .
bma has become such a respected event in the region that government officials in the region like iraq , egypt and syria , have asked the organization to help them structure a similar sporting event .
this ability to focus our attention on something other than the present is really amazing . it allows us to learn and plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can .
coconuts ! you can get killed by a coconut more likely than killed by a shark .
it &apos;s a very sad story , but it really illustrates how animals can sometimes show emotion , a very controversial subject among some older biologists .
fellow sophal ear shares the compelling story of his family &apos;s escape from cambodia under the rule of the khmer rouge . he recounts his mother &apos;s cunning and determination to save her children .
he &apos;s a professor at mit .
it &apos;s just acceptable that play is a good thing .
now this is actually a courageous talk , because you &apos;re kind of setting up yourself in some ways to be ridiculed in some quarters .
it &apos;s a parasitic brain worm that has to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow in order to continue its life cycle .
okay , now do the same for your driving ability .
i literally have the freedom to move in 360 degrees of space and an ecstatic experience of joy and freedom .
but if it &apos;s gone , it &apos;s going to be really miserable and stressful . &quot;
it &apos;s not a system .
he got caught . he got tried .
this is getting ready for the monsoon in bombay , india .
it might surprise some of you here , as it did me , when i discovered that suicide is at the top of the list of the leading causes of death in young people in all countries in the world , including the poorest countries of the world .
i have another idea .
another success story is the mountain gorilla in central africa .
and what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don &apos;t like ?
now , when you approach these animals , you need to understand there &apos;s a dangerous end to them , and you also need to approach them with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness .
and it starts getting really nice .
equipment that &apos;s obsolete , equipment that doesn &apos;t quite work , or it works and you can &apos;t fix it . and there &apos;s nothing wrong with that , so long as we use it and we move on .
he said roughly what &apos;s been said before .
this is my baseline : this is the mediterranean coast with no fish , bare rock and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae .
there &apos;s a just-unbelievable diversity .
i think taskrabbit and other examples of collaborative consumption are like lemonade stands on steroids . they &apos;re just brilliant .
so many such that it &apos;s now just a home for bacteria who really like acidic , toxic conditions .
there was no day of intercultural cooperation .
i collected my findings in a book , placed them chronologically , stating the name , the patron , the medium and the date .
so , we &apos;ve become one of the hot , young jazz recording studios in the united states of america in the middle of the inner city with a high crime rate .
i said , &quot; well i will make a research about how islam actually came to be what it is today , and what roads were taken and what roads could have been taken . &quot;
and the next thing is paralysis .
strings attached to dancers .
i mean , think about how different cities are , actually .
and you &apos;ll see over here , these are multiples of the number 27 .
there is all kinds of sort of plug-and-play kind of legos that you can do to capture , in the wild , in the real world , things like tremor , gait , stride length and those kinds of things .
&quot; oh my god , oh my god , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;
so we went , in fact , to uganda and ran a very similar experiment .
there are other candidates of course , but lolcats will do as a general case .
one of them is that every society has an ecological footprint .
because , as you can see , it was crescent shaped .
he &apos;s a cheeky little devil .
and the poem , if it &apos;s written with the ear , already has been set to its own verbal music as it was composed .
the second one was about a woman complaining because three minivans with six bearded men pulled up and started interrogating her on the spot for talking to a man who wasn &apos;t related to her .
and what we did or did not do to put out the fires in africa .
technology is transformational .
ben kacyra : you can see here , these systems are extremely fast .
well , in gasses , atoms move past each other so fast that they can &apos;t hitch up .
i think everybody understands what that means .
and they &apos;re in your house . they &apos;re in your house .
for this reason , the majority of theoretical physicists believe that the higgs boson could not be the full story .
&quot; the god indra has sinned , in that he has sinned against ... a brahmin .
well , let &apos;s think about how much we are paying now to subsidize fishing : 35 billion dollars per year .
there were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing .
so yes , when the backup systems are put in place , i &apos;m okay , i go in . risky , yes , but it &apos;s a hazard of a profession .
so this small missing chunk here is puzzling .
and i opened it up , it said , &quot; born in iran . &quot; i &apos;m like , &quot; oh , come on , man . &quot;
or , as some people , especially academics prefer , beauty is in the culturally conditioned eye of the beholder .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about is using the circuitry of the brain to implant electrodes and turning areas of the brain up and down to see if we can help our patients .
we must go to watch &quot; afghan star . &quot;
and we just went out and looked at other people &apos;s collections and we found one that has sort of 15 teeth .
i &apos;m going to talk about the power of a word : jihad .
the soil is extremely good .
if an older woman undresses in front of a man because she wants to , the man &apos;s family is cursed . &quot;
and so we can actually extrapolate based on rates of discovery how many more species we &apos;re likely to discover .
better ones , more of them .
lalitesh katragadda : making maps to fight disaster , build economies
it would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly .
but i think it &apos;s possible that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them may well be the voice of this mute thing , the cyrus cylinder .
that &apos;s a bunch of mice that had been poisoned by our scientist friends down in texas , at brooks air base , with anthrax .
but what happened was , when the white guy flew his plane into the building , i know all my middle eastern and muslim friends in the states were watching tv , going , &quot; please , don &apos;t be middle eastern .
and i had to explain , &quot; they &apos;re trying to scare people . &quot;
that was when the enemy was outside the walls .
what would that tell us ?
we often use a term called bylaws .
it &apos;s a game changer .
it was built by the grandest sun king , of the grandest city-state , of the grandest civilization of the americas , the mayas .
grasslands created opportunities .
i &apos;m not taking my eyes off the road .
but the pro-e.u. sentiment in turkey in the past decade has become almost an islamic cause and supported by the islamic liberals and the secular liberals as well , of course .
so even if this object , even if this product includes some technology , it includes some speakers , it includes some microphones and some electronic devices , this object is not a very smart object .
and this is one way to do technology forecasting : get a sense of where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn .
and i think this creates a kind of boundless beauty actually .
this is a very good year .
shame is &quot; i am bad . &quot;
that is the key to understanding the enormous power of consciousness .
you &apos;ve seen people take beneficial technological advances , such as the internet we &apos;ve heard about tonight , and twist them into something corrupting .
as you see it in the photo , inside is the toilet .
it costs about the same to produce a new drug whether that drug treats 1,000 people , 100,000 people , or a million people .
it &apos;s a lot harder than you might think .
accepting the 2007 prize , bill clinton asks for help in bringing health care to rwanda -- and the rest of the world .
because it took the will to do the right thing .
history would know lothar meggendorfer as -- who else ? -- the world &apos;s first true inventor of the children &apos;s pop-up book .
now what we &apos;re seeing lots of examples of , obviously , is the opening up of government data , not enough examples of this yet , but we &apos;re starting to see this practice of people creating and generating innovative applications on top of government data .

it will become more involved in social investment , and social care and in industries where the value comes from what you do with others , not just from what you sell to them , and from relationships as well as from consumption .

and so that &apos;s led to a question for me : why are the most socially-attuned people on earth completely dehumanized when they think about policy ?
he built this machine , and we had a beautiful demonstration of how this thing really works , with these little bits . and it &apos;s an idea that goes way back .

i &apos;m morgan hendry . i am nasa .
i want to leave you with another image of a japanese tea bowl . this one is at the freer gallery in washington , d.c.

and the attraction , the forces , between the molecule and the protein cause the motion . this is a shape-based idea .
so that was all very exciting .
and i got my daughter &apos;s barbie doll dish , i put it right where a bunch of carpenter ants were making debris fields , every day , in my house , and the ants were attracted to the mycelium , because there &apos;s no spores .
we &apos;ve got to go back to square one and start again . &quot;
but this is the end result .

and we were helped by the market inefficiency .
but video has been left out . it arrived on the web in a small box , and there it has remained , completely disconnected from the data and the content all around it .
and what we saw was , we saw these variations , and then they told us the secrets , both about the structure of space-time , and about the contents of the universe , and about how the universe started in its original motions .

so i had a very short deadline for a competition .
you &apos;ve just won a darwin award .

the other reason why i really like this is because it offers an alternative entry point into the complexity of science .
so , this simple narrative equating western demand and chinese suffering is appealing , especially at a time when many of us already feel guilty about our impact on the world , but it &apos;s also inaccurate and disrespectful .

census scientists worked in the rain , they worked in the cold , they worked under water and they worked above water trying to illuminate the wondrous discovery , the still vast unknown , the spectacular adaptations that we see in ocean life .
i wish i could tell that to my daughter .
and , in fact , everybody &apos;s listed twice , because it &apos;s sorted once by name and once by email address .
i &apos;m very , very , very inspired by movies .
i knew even then that i would encounter cultural differences and misunderstandings , but they popped up when i least expected it .
&quot; many do not know the alphabet or multiplication table , cannot write grammatically -- &quot; we &apos;ve heard that sort of thing before , not just in 1956 . 1917 , connecticut schoolteacher .
mbi found 83 percent .
they aggregate around the things they love , the things that they like , and if you think about it , shared interests and values are a far more powerful aggregator of human beings than demographic categories .
you know , make you not follow your usual train of association , but make you rewire .
the audience is too small .
i &apos;m going to start with how i started with this concept seven years ago , when princess diana died .
and -- and -- -- what do all those , including the supreme court , have in common ?
when we didn &apos;t search , we had the illusion that there was no disease .
yes ?
it used to be that conservatives and moderates and liberals could all work together in congress .
i got 200 in the first two weeks .
they &apos;re not sitting in front of the mirror trying to figure themselves out , or thinking about themselves .
and if you don &apos;t understand that in your mental model of this stuff , what happens inside of a cell seems completely mysterious and fortuitous , and i think that &apos;s exactly the wrong image for when you &apos;re trying to teach science .
there &apos;s simply not enough money to deal with any of these problems at scale using the current model .
so , this is the fun part .
we made 30,000 .
it was so simple , in fact , that i suspect a really smart high school student , who didn &apos;t even have calculus , could understand what he wrote down .
so the bones were moved from the cemeteries into the quarries , making them into the catacombs .
but this is all one system .
thank you .
and again , when you start seeing that kind of embrace , and you start looking at them leading their rural lifestyle with a very , very small footprint and moving into an urban lifestyle with a much higher footprint , it starts to become very sobering .
a people who find a way , with their imagination , to carve life out of that very frozen .
in what i call the flushed-and-plumbed world that most of us in this room are lucky to live in , the most common symptoms associated with those diseases , diarrhea , is now a bit of a joke .
so we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring .
these stars are normal like the sun . age , everything was normal .
spoken word poetry is the art of performance poetry .
they &apos;re in some ways using the bush administration as an alibi .
and that in a sense removes us again , like all of our scientific discoveries , or many of them -- it &apos;s this continuous dethroning of man -- of how we think we &apos;re special because we &apos;re alive .
and currently we &apos;re working on oxygen -- oxygen delivery on-site .
how come , then , it &apos;s not so expected to be selective when we go to an art gallery ?
heck , if i ran the web , you could email dead people .
distribution is a nightmare , but not impossible .
so is this fair now to measure this over 19 years ?
and i think this whole notion of these skills should be taught .
because if some of your troops get diarrhea they &apos;re not that effective on the battlefield .
and here , that &apos;s one of my favorites .
despite the fact that each and every one of these disorders originates in the brain , most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis of observable behavior .
so you start with a book , and then you scan it .
without it , a script is just words .
and brian then went on to even greater risk to get this never-before-made photograph of a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom .
it relies too much on transportation , chemical fertilization , big use of water and also refrigeration .
so they are one cell and they have this special property that they only have one piece of dna .
i would like to share that story today .
what &apos;s a problem you want to solve ? &quot;
or i &apos;d dress up really , really sharply or something .
because , as we just heard , everybody thinks they are right .
and now we get to the crux of the disagreement between liberals and conservatives .
my vision is of a world that sounds beautiful and if we all start doing these things , we will take a very big step in that direction .
in 1978 , i was working for time magazine , and i was given a three-day assignment to photograph amerasian children , children who had been fathered by american gis all over southeast asia , and then abandoned -- 40,000 children all over asia .
whether you sit down and eat a meal with your kids , whether you take your kids , or grandchildren , or nieces and nephews shopping to a farmers &apos; market . just do tastings with them .
now , this is not only about numbers ; this is not only about the fact that we &apos;re seven billion people committed to nine billion people , it &apos;s an equity issue as well .
between 1914 and 1945 , 70 million people died in europe alone as a result of armed conflict .
but no , now our meme goes into work where we don &apos;t value play .
but as particular as they feel to us , we know we &apos;re not alone .
so i work in marketing , which i love , but my first passion was physics , a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher , when i had a little less gray hair .
and forward . yeah .
it began a little less than two years ago .
our story of our life is based on direct experience , but it &apos;s embellished .
they said , &quot; you know , when do you want to come out ? &quot;
dr : well what i was aware of was , there was this overwhelming need to act now .
never have we seen , in the past 50 years , such a sharp decline of ecosystem functions and services on the planet , one of them being the ability to regulate climate on the long term , in our forests , land and biodiversity .
they had to move this village in 1987 as a huge dune threatened to swallow it .
the first one was reaching the pole itself .
when you make the claim , in fact , that something on the internet is going to be good for democracy , you often get this reaction .
and aurora kept playing the game , kept finding the little target and getting the orange juice that she wanted to get , that she craved for .
but what he meant was that what we &apos;ve done , really , is stamp collect there .
you don &apos;t know anything . &quot;
so this is a close connection between nakedness and water .
you house is in a terrible state .
i had jewish bibles .
he came over to a piano that was there , and he balanced himself and began playing something like this .
and i think , with a death , you have a funeral , you celebrate the life , and there &apos;s a lot of community support , and it &apos;s something women don &apos;t have with miscarriage .
and if you look at measures of involvement in community life or social capital , very similar relationships closely related to inequality .
now let &apos;s imagine that each single root apex is working in network with all the others .
but this is a global phenomenon , we know that .
soldiers were in the streets shooting at looters and herding some in mass arrests .
but he did have one thing .
in a similar way , we have created the doha film institute .
today , tech companies are the world &apos;s largest editors .
but when i realized that the non-muslim , or the non-islamic-minded actors in the same geography , sometimes behaved similarly , i realized that the problem maybe lies in the political culture of the whole region , not just islam .
i &apos;ve met a young man in new york whose illiterate mother in a village in senegal takes a bus once a month to the capital city of dakar , just to watch a bollywood movie .
i know that beat .
perfect .
it has zones of production , like afghanistan and columbia .
there is no reason why these portraits should look alike .
and you can sort the video a number of different ways .
the stone axe was made by someone for himself .
over the last 20 years , we &apos;ve basically tackled that .
the production version , it uses ip version 6 .
that &apos;s pepe linares , the renowned flamenco singer .
this is just a simple list of some of the types of poisons that come out of these harmful algal blooms : shellfish poisoning , fish ciguatera , diarrheic shellfish poisoning -- you don &apos;t want to know about that -- neurotoxic shellfish poisoning , paralytic shellfish poisoning .
what interesting questions lie ahead for us in this world of no strangers ?
says , &quot; leymah , my wish is to be educated .
last year i spent several months documenting our wounded troops , from the battlefield in iraq all the way home .
recently it has become very much in fashion to call women &quot; the emerging market of the emerging market . &quot;
suffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters without the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity robbing us of a sense of unity of being .
so here is what we learned : 8,000 gallons of gas equivalent to build one house .
she &apos;s got big hair -- although , she told me recently , i can &apos;t say she has big hair , because if i say she has big hair , people will think she &apos;s from texas .
that &apos;s a bad day at the office .
it &apos;s in there , waiting to be sequenced .
but then authorities did something very smart .
and , yeah , we can look back in retrospect and say , yeah , ha-ha , you know -- it &apos;s all microfilm . but that &apos;s -- that &apos;s not the point . he understood the shape of the future .
his point was that strangers are out there .
and , as a cardiologist , to think that you could see in real time a patient , an individual , anywhere in the world on your smartphone , watching your rhythm -- that &apos;s incredible , and it &apos;s with us today .
we did 250 hours of diving here in 2005 .
and this openness is the beginning of exploratory play .
and he had created it exactly because mandatory sentencing laws were taking the judgment out of judging .
really ? you should have brought a picture . that &apos;s wonderful .
but what you need to do is fan the flames of the revolution .
how many people gave of their time and their expertise , and their patience , to deal with me ?
a part of me had become alienated from myself .
so that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
there is no caretaking in desire .
and he tried to persuade me to write the browser for it , because his system didn &apos;t have any graphics or fonts or layout or anything ; it was just plain text .
and to a fish nerd , this is some pretty exciting stuff .
everyone they knew lived in similar circumstances , and it was still better than the dormitories and homes of rural china .
and one of the things i can do is make it bigger if i want to emphasize it and make it more important .
but then , of course , there was the deep horizon oil spill .
how to measure , if we have planets where the amount of those elements is small , so those planets are tectonically dead , there cannot be life .
tristram stuart : the global food waste scandal
there is a cost of compression .
but technology has its own agenda , like anything , like life itself .
so that really is what we &apos;re doing .
diving day and night was really easy for me in 1970 , when i led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time -- at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon .
i went to egypt . i went to say hello to this one egyptian guy , i went , one , two . i went for three . he wasn &apos;t into it .
richard nixon goes to represent the united states government at the celebrations for independence in ghana .
i &apos;m self -- it &apos;s self-inspired . diatomic structures , radiolaria , the things that we couldn &apos;t see but we can do now -- these , again , are cored out . they &apos;re made virtually from nothing .
yeah , i &apos;m at the depressio , and i want to get over to amazonis so i plug it into the mars map , and click the button and there &apos;s my directions .
i heard this amazing story about miuccia prada .
they &apos;re paintings i made and put a palmpilot in the middle as a kind of display that &apos;s sort of thinking , i &apos;m abstract art . what am i ? i &apos;m abstract .
where did this guy get this confidence , the audacity of it ?
it &apos;s just a set of choices that people make .
the first book is called , &quot; the end of print , &quot; and it was done along with a film , working with william burroughs .
so , in 1998 , along with my mentors don burke and colonel mpoudi-ngole , we went to actually start this work in central africa , to work with hunters in this part of the world .
one is under construction by the chinese and the other 11 belong to us .
it &apos;s an aerial regional-scale environmental surveyor .
i &apos;m trying to build a global team , which will look at the global grand challenges that the world is facing .
what i remember today from this is that objects tell stories , so storytelling has been a really strong influence in my work .
you won &apos;t need to know trig .
look at the difference there . it doesn &apos;t take much -- every layperson could see that difference , and computers can be programmed to easily detect it .
but he told me to believe and feel the wind in my face .
and you have all these pathways going on at the same time .
so we find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance simply because it yields conditions vital to our form of life .
that &apos;s the theme of my next 15 minutes here .
how many people have seen a &quot; beach closed &quot; sign ?
&quot; i need to be in some backwoods redneck town so that i can feel beautiful . &quot;
and this is my world .
but part way through , they ran out .
and there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid of time looking at the effects of our body language , or other people &apos;s body language , on judgments .
these are hundreds of classes .
i have some questions .
this is not keith barry doing a magic trick .
that is the ground for mind training .
and so , too , we &apos;ve discovered that there is an infinite taxonomy of crochet hyperbolic creatures .
or we can monitor doctors prescribing behaviors , passively , and see how the diffusion of innovation with pharmaceuticals occurs within &#91; networks of &#93; doctors .
a mix of legal and illegal activities is used .
there &apos;s a receiver .
but then we were wondering whether this is a local phenomenon , or is truly global ?
and conversely , for every species or other entity or phenomenon , there exist important problems for the solution of which , those particular objects of research are ideally suited .
and i actually didn &apos;t leave my house for about three days .
and yet , noaa has now shown us , for example -- you see that little blue thing above hawaii ?
but i want to be able to make them not messy .
i was separated , largely , from my family , including my mother and father .
hi . hi .
and that &apos;s that i think it &apos;s given us a wonderful narrative -- almost a creation story , if you &apos;d like -- about the universe , from modern science over the last few decades .
and some of these patients played a video game where they drive around a small town .
it stands to reason that we love chocolate cake because it is sweet .
and we &apos;ve been going steadily downhill .
i maintain this is code inside the army for , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do this . &quot;
at 115 they would only produce enough weapons grade fuel to show that they know how , but they wouldn &apos;t build a weapon : they would build a research quantity .
jy : now that we grew the bacteria , we wanted to isolate strains by streaking onto mediate plates , because we thought that would be less accident-prone , but we were wrong again .
in 2005 , the egyptian stock exchange returned over 145 percent .
coke is everywhere .
in 1999 , when global witness called for oil companies to make payments on deals transparent , well , some people laughed at the extreme naiveté of that small idea .
so despite making something that is seemingly revolutionary , we really focused on doing as little new as possible .
so the end image was never visible as a physical whole .
for example , have you ever considered that there are listening positions , places you can listen from ?
street plays , auctions , petitions .
there &apos;s been an experiment for the last four or five years on the georges bank , or the grand banks off of newfoundland . it &apos;s a no-take fishing zone .
and i &apos;m no pathologist , but you can &apos;t tell much from this .
the same principles , the same dynamics , the same organization is at work in all of these , including us , and it can scale over a range of 100 million in size .
it was built by 12 barefoot architects who can &apos;t read and write , built on $ 1.50 a sq. ft .
it has 40 different components put together by other people .
but then i began to think of other things .
but we can actually be more specific in defining our universe .
so i &apos;m like , &quot; yeah , i &apos;m just applying to pitt for law school . &quot;
thank you .
the bonobo &apos;s abilities have stunned scientists around the world .
now , what does this mean to some of you ?
it folds in thirds . it &apos;s a very simple pattern -- you wouldn &apos;t even call that origami .
let &apos;s look at some 2006 numbers . kenya : over 60 percent . nigeria : over 40 percent .
i was born in calcutta -- a family where my father and his father before him were journalists , and they wrote magazines in the english language .
from that came a lot of insights , or outsights , as i called them , things that i learned since losing my sight .
so , i decided over the years , because of a series of experiments that this is because of context and architecture .
and it has -- the steady state is , more or less , one percent of the adult world population is hiv-infected .
as china buys all these crappy cars , we should be riding things like this . counterbalance .
but now what ?
so the goal was to evacuate the target cities .
and if i succeed in doing that , maybe you would go back with the thought that you could build on , and perhaps help me do my work .
you could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose or meaning or significance .
in fact , if we count all the individual organisms , we would come at much larger numbers .
this is a symbol of what we can achieve when we believe in the impossible , when we have a team , when we have pioneering spirit , and especially when we understand that all the certainties we have should be thrown overboard .
so let &apos;s start with some good news , and the good news has to do with what do we know based on biomedical research that actually has changed the outcomes for many very serious diseases ?
again , makes you wonder .
the japanese government were perhaps the first , when they decided to invest first 3 billion , later another 2 billion in this field .
joe , thank you very much .
jay walker : you know , economists love to talk about the stupidity of people who buy lottery tickets . but i suspect you &apos;re making the exact same error you &apos;re accusing those people of , which is the error of value .
you learn things unconsciously .
whether water level goes up or down , the beauty is there throughout .
but if we turn on head tracking , the computer can change the image that &apos;s on the screen and make it respond to the head movements .
they then recur , i give them that same drug every week .
this is work done with my colleague helen mayberg from emory .
moving along to lincoln center .
does this then mean that there is after all some absolute difference between people outside africa and inside africa in that people outside africa have this old component in their genome from these extinct forms of humans , whereas africans do not ?
and there are only seven of them .
things are amazing . there &apos;s just so many things to be happy about . &quot;
and it is a sort of race , and each and every animal is different , and the winning codes will multiply .
so , why not use a yield sign ?
and what was amazing about that discovery is that it also solved the mystery of what pollinated a unique flower .
and so , the assignment to the students was , how should the steak of tomorrow be ?
then the u.n. jazz orchestra dropped by and we recorded them and got nominated for a second grammy back to back .
we do it every day , while reading novels , watching television or going to the movies .
or in a parallel universe , you find this information .
and then there &apos;s the problem of anonymous shell companies .
and in an age that is sometimes nowadays frightening or confusing , we feel reassured by the almost parental-like authority of experts who tell us so clearly what it is we can and cannot do .
stop wasting food . thank you very much .
i published everywhere . i wrote down and measured everything , and i said , in nine months , a group of children left alone with a computer in any language will reach the same standard as an office secretary in the west .
you see it came down there .
so for the few of us that were there in a professional capacity , this extraordinary volunteer response to this animal crisis was profoundly moving and awe-inspiring .
if everyone in this room got involved , who knows what we could do ?
how do i compose ?
but they want experience in creating an organization .
life adds information to matter .
you can &apos;t do that with a gasoline car .
yves rossy has landed in england .
the truth is that everyone has a different rationale .
so this is when i ran out of my idealism and decided to quit my ngo job and actually study how the internet could impede democratization .
this is an environmental disaster writ large .
the collaborative effort was fabulous .
we &apos;ve taught well over 200,000 afghan security forces to read and write at a basic level .
when i first learned the statistics , i was pretty stunned at how bad things are .
but paper electronics is one of the most promising branches of material science in that it allows us to create cheaper and flexible electronics .
an object devoid of intent -- it &apos;s random , it &apos;s imitative , it repels us . it &apos;s like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away .
i do not want to have my opinions challenged .
possibly , but i remember my childhood .
i design for that condition , biopolymers . it &apos;s the future .
and this is so deep-seated in our psyche that when we &apos;re presented with a progress bar and presented with easy , granular steps to take to try and complete that progress bar , we will do it .
go to bed .
that is all ye know on earth , and all ye need to know . &quot;
ten years ago , when i was on an airplane and i introduced myself to my seatmate , and told them what i did , they &apos;d move away from me .
i can still remember sort of that smell of rotting flesh as i pulled the curtain back to see her .
these people have different needs .
and i get a little object here and i can look inside this object , i &apos;ll call it a car . and here &apos;s a little behavior : car forward .
we sent it over to uganda .
they eject it to the surface where it floats , and it is picked up by an autonomous airplane , and it &apos;s brought back to the laboratory within 24 hours of the eruption .
so the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education .
my first point is that the pursuit of happiness is obligatory .
let &apos;s talk trash .
the things on the ground are algae .
but who knows that ?
let &apos;s try this here .
and this is a companion , and this is a relationship that never dries up .
status-driven , conspicuous consumption thrives from the language of novelty .
it &apos;s what all journalists do .
so let me give you a few striking examples of this .
now you &apos;re going to have 30 minutes to solve 15 puzzles .
it had a driver and a passenger , and after the car had passed the judge by , the passenger extended his hand , pointed it back to the judge as the car continued on , just as the teenagers had described it , right ?
you see , the magician doesn &apos;t really saw the lady in half . &quot;
it &apos;s a pretty panel of glass .
and even if we don &apos;t want them , we need to buy them , because , if we don &apos;t buy them , the system crashes .
and that , and more besides , would be in the palm of your hand .
they &apos;re eminently qualified to make flat screen tvs .
and then i went ...
now , as many of you know , airbnb is a peer-to-peer marketplace that matches people who have space to rent with people who are looking for a place to stay in over 192 countries .
so , the mumbai indians flew in dwayne bravo from trinidad and tobago , overnight . and when he had to go back to represent the west indies , they asked him , &quot; when do you have to reach ? &quot;
well , then they said , &quot; do you believe that god speaks to us through his righteous prophets ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no , i don &apos;t . &quot;
some people question , &quot; why is it in black and white ?
i &apos;d be like some kind of internet genius , and me , i &apos;d like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that -- pop ! -- i &apos;d go wireless .
you &apos;d do probably two things , wouldn &apos;t you ?
that &apos;s part of the game of golf ?
and as you know , china is the most populous .
and because it &apos;s so much stuff , it &apos;s really important for the atmospheric system .
it was released in poland to create friction between frank and hitler , so that hitler would imagine frank was trying to usurp his power .
and i &apos;m going to talk about hiv today , about the deaths , about the stigma .
so what we did is we took a moment in time from these recordings and asked , what was the retina seeing at that moment ?
and the fact that pig heart valves have lots of these on them is the reason that you can &apos;t transplant a pig heart valve into a person easily .
and in the bmj , in the first edition of january , 2012 , you can see a study which looks to see if people kept to that ruling , and it turns out that only one in five have done so .
and they said , &quot; we do not intend to be a typewriter maker . &quot;
and i was hoping hillary would get to the white house , because she &apos;d have been out of our home for four years .
so that became a challenge .
they &apos;re making more money while retired than they were making while they were working .
now help me not to be a beggar anymore . &quot;
&quot; ... but . i had a dream too , once , kid , but i was afraid to pursue it . &quot;
that &apos;s too long if you &apos;re poor .
but here &apos;s a face from 20th century science that might surprise you in a discussion about compassion .
ok , so that &apos;s the healing one .
bertrand piccard : my solar-powered adventure
and china was emitting 0.6 , and india was emitting 0.32 tons per capita .
but most r and d is going to be institutionally funded , by the polish academy of sciences or the engineering and physical sciences research council or whatever , and you need to get past those people .
and we thought it had something to do with this protein called amp kinase , an energy protein .
why ? because as long as it rotates , the locking is maintained .
in south africa , they have a phrase called ubuntu .
it &apos;s open access ; you can all go in and download data as you wish .
natural selection also explains pleasures -- sexual pleasure , our liking for sweet , fat and proteins , which in turn explains a lot of popular foods , from ripe fruits through chocolate malts and barbecued ribs .
and we were right .
post-second world war , the influence of the automobile has really been devastating in a lot of our cities .
and i said , &quot; well i &apos;ve been a woman for 60 years , but i &apos;ve only been secretary of state for a few minutes . &quot;
people , energy , make the glue , organize the team .
in a battery , i strive to maximize electrical potential ; when mentoring , i strive to maximize human potential .
but even since just 1995 , &apos; 96 , the way we communicate has been completely transformed . we email , we text , we skype , we facebook . it &apos;s insane .
there is things to see , there is the big challenge .
so , i wanted to show 2.3 million prison uniforms , and in the actual print of this piece , each uniform is the size of a nickel on its edge .
ao : who is this ?
and so this would be the typical talk i would give .
so this material is silk .
now suppose that that visceral difference makes you subtly dissociate the future from the present every time you speak .
the assumption then that we do best when the individual self chooses only holds when that self is clearly divided from others .
and in europe , there &apos;s certain parts of europe , where we &apos;re seeing a four-fold increase in certain genital birth defects .
fix the incentives , fix the incentives , fix the incentives ...
wherever there is always snow , the bears are white .
so each time i draw my circle of chalk on the pavement and enter as the improvising comic silent character i created 45 years ago , i am as happy as when i am in the clouds .
rachel pike : the science behind a climate headline
this is a low-end titanium knee .
but it &apos;s not . it &apos;s a projection which our clever brains create in order to cheat ourselves from the reality of death .
and after i &apos;ve actually sculpted them , i have to paint them .
ng : shortly . shortly . we will come back to you on that .
no , absolutely not . i &apos;m not saying that .
he had a brachial avulsion , so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed , lying in a sling for a year , and then the arm was amputated .
now i want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what china is like , just as a beginning .
now , you can do an experiment tonight over the reception , ok , to figure out what that image will look like .
i admired them , and i decided to become a doctor .
and i said in the beginning , i wasn &apos;t going to tell you about exports .
and each of us knew that when we left the spinal ward we would never be the same .
in the three months since that swim ended , i &apos;ve sat down with oprah and i &apos;ve been in president obama &apos;s oval office .
there &apos;s been an explosion of collaborative consumption -- web-powered sharing of cars , apartments , skills . rachel botsman explores the currency that makes systems like airbnb and taskrabbit work : trust , influence , and what she calls &quot; reputation capital . &quot;
now they get three apple cubes .
it &apos;s right here .
fifty versus 35 , that &apos;s a big move . eleven versus nine ? come on .
this is one of her songs .
launched it on the 12 of november .
but once they &apos;re applied to numeric structure , then you can feel more comfortable .
and policing copyright violations for children &apos;s birthday cakes was such a hassle that the college bakery said , &quot; you know what , we &apos;re getting out of that business .
i can drive my toyota element when i &apos;m going to go on that surfing trip .
this is boston dynamics &apos; &quot; bigdog . &quot;
the first is redistribution markets .
so , you &apos;d have a little instruction below it , you know , for those who didn &apos;t see the public service announcements .
let &apos;s just talk about full-scale i.q.
so far i haven &apos;t come across such an area , except for one case . i won &apos;t name the area , but somewhere in the world people said , we don &apos;t have this problem , because we have perfect teachers and perfect schools .
the one advantage that they had over most of you is wisdom , because they had a long life .

the three biggest uses of energy in a store are heating and air conditioning , then lighting , and then refrigeration .
and we lay our eggs there , we don &apos;t have to worry about other eggs or anything like that .
it &apos;s often about understanding culture and context before we even know where to start to have ideas .
and so we can encapsulate these regions of ultra-conservation through evolution -- how these viruses evolved -- by just choosing dna elements or rna elements in these regions to represent on our chip as detection reagents .
so i add some food source to the system .
if the ceo , just like our participants , thought the essence of meaning is unimportant , then he &#91; wouldn &apos;t &#93; care .
we talk about it in terms of engagement , or non-compliance .

those words are by rick warren .
and i don &apos;t know the answer to that , so i &apos;m not going to tell you .
and this kind of relationship between designer and scientist started when i was at school .
well , i tried this device .
that is the reality of our modern life .
if you look at the square that you build with the origami and some counters growing off it , the pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need to make a memory .
the emphasis on clean government would have gradually squeezed out the political crooks , because there wouldn &apos;t be any money in taking part in the politics .
but maybe there is another problem as well .
let me give just you an example to back up that last statement .
and again , this is a pretty big march to take here .
and the reason this is interesting is that it gives us an opportunity to prove whether or not these exotic objects really exist .
no . but the thinking that we have to come up with has to be based on a realistic assessment of where we are .
if the stick were ever found , all humankind would be happy .
when i made the announcement , george did not turn rosy , but went pale as my doublet .
should they recover in a specialized cardiac unit in hospital , or should they recover at home ?
but it was great . &quot;
the question that you will ask will determine much of the answer that you get .
it &apos;s a very big signal ; it &apos;s sent to the brain says , &quot; go and eat . &quot;
and of course these simple retrieval questions are not the end of the story .
in the future we hope that we can integrate this little hole into these smart phones .
and here is what it does .
we &apos;ve come a long way . we &apos;re doing good .
do we really understand that principle of tuning ? the answer is , yes !

he solves my problems in the village .
ally willis : where millions of collaborators wanted the song , because to look at them strictly as spam is missing what this medium is about .

but i know i needed to .
you can take any one of the major global challenges we &apos;ve discussed this week and ask yourself , where is the leadership from governments to step up and come up with solutions , responses , to those international problems ?
people didn &apos;t know what to do because they had never been presented with the option before .
and you must be wondering , &quot; what on earth ?
it &apos;ll be , in a sense , like having time on a telescope , except you &apos;ll have your own port .

i &apos;d like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper .

and apparently , evolution had occurred at a pretty rapid rate on one tree , between the time they named it and the time i arrived , because i &apos;m sure there were at least three trees on that island when we were there .
so clearly , from the inside , we are doing our best to change our image , and it &apos;s exploding .
and this is actually new technology still under development .
asthma : large number , we could detect things like pollen count , air quality , respiratory rate . breast cancer , i &apos;ll show you an example of that real quickly .
and as it moves , it takes pieces of the earth with it . it bends up .
by now , about 60 percent of the large companies it &apos;s been part of the pension protection act .
we can say that .
and basically , the concept is , how do you represent the three-dimensional image of the night sky that surrounds us onto a flat , portable , two-dimensional surface .
so to unload that great weight -- if that indeed exists -- you can recline .
this pair , in fact , these currently cost about 19 dollars .
some you could see , some you couldn &apos;t .
and the more you can recline , in a way , the better it is .
that is an unknown part of them .
i was taught that when i was eight years old .
the williams sisters compete -- one wins wimbledon .

now , i haven &apos;t yet given you a definition .
if ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny , then children are somewhat closer to our roots as primates in the arboreal forest .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s intuitive .
so in the theater , as much as the story is critical and the book and the language , the telling of the story , how it &apos;s told , the mechanics , the methods that you use , is equal to the story itself .
what happened back a few years ago was a group of theoretical physicists at mit actually came up with this concept of transferring power over distance .
and the journalist said , why is there so little response out of washington ?
we turn them into heroes , or we turn them into punch lines .
i look around at my siblings and my cousins -- and as i said , there are a lot of us -- and i see teachers and musicians , hedge fund managers , designers .
they would ignore the geeks , and god forbid , the laggards .
it is time for us to accept both the extraordinary successes of mammography and the limitations .
so i &apos;d like you to come back with me just for a few minutes to a dark night in china , the night i met my husband .
but that &apos;s because of the kind of strangeness of the market itself .
these words , i hold onto all my life .
because , after all , god is just .
well , another issue people bring up is somehow that hand calculating procedures teach understanding .
so all of my performances are based on entirely what i experience , and not by learning a piece of music , putting on someone else &apos;s interpretation of it , buying all the cds possible of that particular piece of music , and so on and so forth .

a couple of weeks ago , i took a conservative tea party woman to lunch .
and i will now do for the rest of my life the one laptop per child , which i &apos;ve sort of been doing for a year and a half , anyway .

in infrastructure , we &apos;re working with a company out of boston called geosyntec .
so in march 2010 , we signed the first social impact bond with the ministry of justice around peterborough prison .
an example . this man changed my life .
it &apos;s used by all different bacteria and it &apos;s the language of interspecies communication .
you can see that for the prevalence to be as high as unaids says , we have to really see 60 deaths per 10,000 rather than 20 deaths per 10,000 in this age group .
and if it &apos;s just papers and phys. rev. letters , we &apos;ve got a problem .
dana : there &apos;s too much darkness .
you can ask , how do you stack up for positive emotion , for meaning , for flow , against literally tens of thousands of other people ?
when someone tells you that privacy is incompatible with the benefits of big data , consider that in the last 20 years , researchers have created technologies to allow virtually any electronic transactions to take place in a more privacy-preserving manner .
also , optimistic language matters a lot .
i thought maybe the mirror box was gone .
patrick ewing , who played for georgetown in the &apos; 80s , comes back every summer .
time for a quick show of hands .
at the age of 19 , i was on the national leadership of this organization in the u.k.

so , for us , seeing color is one of the simplest things the brain does .
could we have the solutions ?
and copernicus looks like johnny carson , which is really weird .

why ? this is a real mystery .
are they interconnected ?
but we create an incredible contradiction .

hands up -- how many of you have books , cds , dvds , or videos lying around your house that you probably won &apos;t use again , but you can &apos;t quite bring yourself to throw away ?
gb : well , of course national identity remains important .
and this is the great team that helped us make it happen .
but most important to make it work -- and he emphasized this -- is that it took knowing the people in the communities .
and you have the market revolution of the 1980s and the huge increase of inequality in societies .
and this zero hunger program costs .5 percent of gdp and has lifted many millions of people out of hunger and poverty .
the proscenium , also . as far as we know this is the first building in the world in which the proscenium can entirely fly out of the space .
this is no exaggeration .
and then we &apos;ll put on a satellite tag that will give us the long-distance journeys with the light-based geolocation algorithms solved on the computer that &apos;s on the fish .
the other part is the belief that all children are capable of success .
we &apos;d go from three percent of the arable land , to four percent .
the rest of it is the bedside console ; just for reference , this is a sleep tracking system from just a few years ago -- i mean , really until now .
and to understand that , you have to understand a little bit about how stealth works .
fifty communicable diseases like to travel in human shit .
people in the audience in these opera houses , when they were built , they used to yell out to one another .
i &apos;m going to refer to some of those as well , and i &apos;m just going to mention a few of the commitments as illustrations that we &apos;ve got .
so in this situation too , to decode the information contained in patterns like this , watching alone won &apos;t do .
why does this matter ?
it doesn &apos;t really feel like playing mindless action video games .
when the teachers would ask questions , she &apos;d be the first person to raise her hand .
they &apos;re flying through their space , ocean space .
we need that in the world .
so let &apos;s abandon the paradigm of let &apos;s search for the coolest chemistry and then hopefully we &apos;ll chase down the cost curve by just making lots and lots of product .
women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce .
this was eight years ago , some people were more republican back then .
no machines have been developed .
you see the glacier flowing in from the right , dropping off into the sea , camera shooting every hour .
we exercise , we eat healthy , we take vitamins .
and once the muscle &apos;s contracted completely , everything &apos;s stored up -- the latch flies upward , and you &apos;ve got the movement .
and i didn &apos;t understand why , in one hand they say , &quot; speak the truth , &quot; in the other hand , when you say the truth , they hated you .
you weren &apos;t in a dead zone .
now , the old timers didn &apos;t take a fancy guitar string and make anything like this .
if we look closer , we see those peaks occur at the same month every year .
i guarantee you the next 30 days are going to pass whether you like it or not , so why not think about something you have always wanted to try and give it a shot for the next 30 days .

and now they have a third daughter , and the daughters , all of them , are being tutored in education because saima knows what &apos;s really important .
and i think that moment of completely new thought perhaps creates a freedom that spreads to the rest of other people &apos;s lives .
there was no metaphor . was it a database ?
and for the very first time in my scientific career , i broke scientific protocol , which is that you take the data and publish them in scientific journals and then begin to talk about them .
who are you ?
the supreme court decided .
all right , so what about the rest of it ?
and let &apos;s face it , the contract from a major multinational brand to a supplier in india or china has much more persuasive value than the local labor law , the local environmental regulations , the local human rights standards .
that was just 10,000 years ago .
and this is a moment from &quot; the graduate . &quot; do you remember this moment ?
so controlling stuff with your mind is pretty cool .
now , put them on both cups .
it &apos;s not about making things that have the most media attention , but it &apos;s about making places where we can actually do the most good .
he leaves , a little confused and disappointed .
richard preston , thank you very much , i think .
and i thought , &quot; you know , that might actually make a pretty good lure . &quot;
but deciphering the script is a very challenging task .
we took the corner of the car park in the station that you saw , and we made vegetable beds for everybody to share and pick from themselves .

aaron koblin : visualizing ourselves ... with crowd-sourced data
and our big idea is that the scientific miracle of this decade should be the complete eradication of poliomyelitis .
yet the people inside africa have more genetic variation .
in this scenario , nobody &apos;s listening to anybody .
so , this is bitu qalandar , who was our first experiment .
well that &apos;s not true , but we &apos;ll get to the goose in a minute .
this was , at a distance , realizing that someone was feeling something , wanting to affect them in a particular way , using media to do it , putting it online and realizing that there was a greater impact .
in my experience , in fact , the light footprint was extremely helpful .
really what i &apos;m talking about here is trying to create a kind of artificial life .
the issue is for us to recognize that these are neighborhoods -- this is a legitimate form of urban development -- and that cities have to engage these residents , because they are building the cities of the future .
it is a very long , linear molecule , a coded version of how to make another copy of you . it &apos;s your blueprint .
to make sure these buildings are safe , it &apos;s not going to take policy -- it &apos;s going to take reaching out to the masons on the ground and helping them learn the proper techniques .
you , you survive . it &apos;s ok .

so while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers , we are willing to do it with a long-term view , and we like to have a wider definition of profits than just the economic profit in the next quarter .
so i get the impression that some parts of the scientific establishment are morphing into a kind of priesthood .
in fact , so many different points of resonance that it &apos;s going to be difficult to bring them all up , but i &apos;ll try to do my best .
and i say to you , &quot; your job is to attach the candle to the wall so the wax doesn &apos;t drip onto the table . &quot; now what would you do ?

but don &apos;t get me wrong : there are actually types of surveillance that are okay .
the media wants to be liquid .
