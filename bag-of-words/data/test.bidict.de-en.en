easy that knowing that yet allways hereafter the galaxy travel oder the meanings the myth the oldest the inuit still full relevance are oder that himalayan the buddhists yet always the breath des dharma tracking signifies the switchboard epiphany the anthropology ins memory call that is the thought that the globe the us lifestyle not an absolute sinn exists just as an model the reality as an follow an gruppe by certain options the adaptation the ours ancestors success pre many generational
and naturally split us everybody
wir become everyone born we bringing kinder zur globe
us traverse
we must us mit the separation thru the tod and therefore should us not surprising that wir everybody sing dancing and and arts
but interesting is the unique des the tempo des everyone civilization
plays none roles the the woods of borneo or the haiti or the warriors the by the the andes or an caravanserai the saharan is accidental the colleague using the ich pre a monthly the deserts travelled am or itself a the hang des everest the the globe
all this people teachings us that nor others other other paths zur orientation to the soil returns
and that is one introductions the when man a only using hope fulfilling may
together forming the innumerable crops the globe an nets out and live das the soil wrapped and for that probably the soil equally important is how the biosafety the man as biosphere knows
man can cultural als a introduce can als the totals aller thoughts and dreams myths thoughts inspirations and the from the human imaginations since the des consciousness spawned became defined be
the is that legacies the humanity
you is the symbol all whose what we are and why we als amazing species capable are
and equally wie the biosphere stark demolished became happened using the just mit still pace
not biologist would examples cart asserting that oder more aller species short front the extinct are simple not right and yet this scenarios on the territory the biological multiplicity conforms barely the what us als scenarios to the region the cultural multiplicity known is
and the crucial indicator is the extinct the languages
as everybody of them space born became became to the soil language talked
well is one speech not only the entirety des oder one row from
a language is expression des human humanities
they is an medium using the the souls one certain civilization access the substantive globe finds
any speech is like one forests des humanities an watershed an thought ein ecosystem options
and by these languages be today while we here monterey sitting exact the half not more the ear from children
she be toddlers not more taught this when nothin will are they indeed already dead
what could lonely his als vom silence wrapped sein one the last sein the yours language speaking no opportunity have the wisdom the ancestral or the hoping childrens expect
and yet terrible fate indeed somebody somewhere to the soil aller two weekly because aller two weekly dies ein older human and takes the last syllables one alte languages with ins tomb
and ich white that some of them say is not better would the world not ein venue if us everybody nur one languages speak would and i sage well lass these language yoruba be let she cantonese his
lass they his
and then would she suddenly acknowledge like would if she her own language not speak could
therefore wants ich you today at a voyage thru the a brief travel thru the attempting them intelligible making what actually lost departed is
well gives some under us the forgot that i if me saga miscellaneous possibilities des sein really different possibilities des sein mine
take she examples child the northwestern des amazonas das volk the beliefs that they the vom eastern belly from saints snake

all the mythological history this peculiar these major due the intermarriage sechs or seven language spoken be is however that man ever someone hear the a languages learns
she listen just and commence then speak

well these level the intuition will very important
allways if wir and landscape mindset summoning us either rousseau and this alte rumor des wilden which his simplify a racist thought is or thoreau and tell these humans are more using the nature linked as we
so are neither sentimental yet will they from the nostalgic weakening
remain not lots platz the by asmat oder the winches from tibet she have but anyway thru zeit and rituals a mysterious nimbus the soil formed the not to the idea relies ihr conscious close be to an far intuition the idea that the earth only exist may cuz they that human conscious becomes

me got even using my professor richard evan the husband the the with the detection the magical mushrooms mexico the years initiated has discusses i claimed that man this not as classify could the moment the man the impacts feels man not more is one hallucination learn
but the thing with is the that they not orally be can you thru ein human gut course enzyme with name be
you can only connect using some others chemical orally becoming the the mao
now the captivating is that the the the liane contained are of exact the type are the necessary is the ask she so yourself
wie can these people from an flora by types plant these two morphologically not kin vegetation locate the when on these way combine an type of version creating that this entire larger als the sum his share is
wir using these euphemism attempt and mistake what als insignificant
but asked man the indian say she the crop speaking uns
so what signifies this
this strain the have versions the they all in großer distance woodland recognizing the for our eye as one kind appearing
and then asked man you wie you their taxonomy justify and they say i thought somewhat by plant
me mine even nothing and me said nope
so introduces that man each the variant in and they singing an one various
well das brings them doctoral harvard but is much interesting als counting
well this das problem is that self at uns the sympathetic for the difficult lage the natives have you als and viewing you but somehow at the history restricted while the real world ours world
so fact is that man this jahrhundert years not for its wars oder technical innovate reminder will rather als a era the we goods and the massive devastation the biological and cultural diversity on the soil either proactive supported or passive accepted so that trouble is not the modification
everyone cultures have allways reunited the dance mit new involved
and das trouble is not the tech

know she the the extinct by people is generic sentenced but the the devastation the lifestyle the people becomes not just not convicted universal and als part one celebrated
and they can the suffering not comprehension if she not to tier have
i travelled once with a young colleague mileage by chengdu thru after lhasa and as i after lhasa came beheld ich the faces behind the statistics of man hear holy the debris and ash turned were millions people the while the from the assassinated became

margaret mead the große told before you died that its tallest fear is that while us us direction one thread worldview moving us not only the totality bandwidth the human imaginations on one thinking reduces see would that wir day aus a dream wake and forgotten have that ever others opportunities gab
and is mindset that ours species perhaps since yrs existed
the revolution the us the agriculture brought and us moment the cult des the poetry des by the prose the replaced and hierarchy specialisation and surpluses found front only years instead
the moderne industrial world like wir you know is hardly yrs old
now this superficial history say me not that us alle responses on the challenges have wir the upcoming opposite standing
if we this myriad after the meaning des question answer she using various vote
and song will wir the possibility this his what wir are human using conscious the the importance deliberately are that allen people and gardens one room prosper can will must and admits moments des optimism
here is an photograph that me northern finish the as ich mit on the went and this man told me a wonderful history grandfather
the canadian gov is not always very well mit the inuit and during the year the our domination were you coerced settlements drag
the grandfather alte
the familie the scared sein lifestyle had took he all weapons and all tooling
well must you know that the inuit none angst prior the cooling have she they advantage
the yours sledge became initially out fish the was crafted
the grandfather des dreaded not pre the night or the tempest
after outside his pants from and seine hand and as the freeze began you the form

and is to sage ein icon for the resistor the inuit and aller natives on the globe
the canadian cabinet gab the inuit april the complete supervision about a zone back das bigger is als california and texas together
is our new homeland and nunavut
is one zone they controlling everybody
ein examples wie an nation one government the reparations using his search and reach can
and eventually belive i is pretty obviously for from uns the these remote aim the earth traveled are recognize that they even not removed are
you are the from someone
they represent parts the human imagination the past times and for all of uns become the dreaming this children as the dream ours own childs part the geographic the hopes
what we bei nationally ultimately attempt is that us belive that policymakers never slightly reach
we believe that polemics we belief that polemics not persuasive is but we faith that the globe modify may and hence are we probably the best institution for the globe our website receive million hits every month
nations send our
ours periodicals become of million read
and wir businesses one series from trips the at we our crowd by cultural miracles that they from the blinding and hopefully be she one to the other the headquarter epiphany the anthropology assume that this world deserved hat to assorted sage existence that us a an truly multicultural pluralistic globe find can at the the wisdom of allen human common wellbeing contributing may
many thanks
what ich them first quickly how possibility reveal will is the basic labour a neue tech the wir microsoft as part one takeover front exactly an year pass have the is and is a surroundings the you either local or removes using huge volumes of visual data circumvent can
wir see many many digital photos here the man seamlessly and swivel at wisely neu arranging can
and is anyway how many informations we contemplate as tall these collections are or how big the pics are
the most by them are digital one cam but here is sample one scan of the and is an area of
power difference because das sole what the performance like restrict may is the number px to desktop each moment hat also one very flexible architectural
is a whole books one sample for
this is by dickens every column is an chapter
proof that truly a text and not one image can wir something as das doing truly show that these a genuine representation des and no image is
maybe is one artificial kind ein read
ich would not recommend
is ein fall is a edition by guardian
any large picture is the start
and das admits them really das enjoyment and the good experiences a real one magazine oder an zeitung read what an kind medium using is
us have also something the corner this issue des guardian done
we have an incorrect displays using very hoher designed the lot higher as in an ordinary advertisement is and us have additional contents added
if you the features cars see want can she you here see
or other models or even technical specification
and grabs truly these ideas on this limitations for the disposable platz at the monitor abolish
us hope that das none and other rubbish more signifies the should not required sein
naturally is that mapping one the truly obvious apps for an technology like these
and ich wants here truly not lots period spend apart tell that wir too section contribute becoming
but are everybody street the
upstairs at the image the nasa
letting you uns now somewhat else
das is now even live internet she can
is one project mit the names this realy two different technology combines
the one is and the others is a very good research about the by noah a the university washington unter the advice by steve seitz the
and rick of microsoft research conducted became a very good cooperation
so is live internet is of powered
she can das see when us this kind of views bei us through photos penetrating can and this experiences the do
but the spatial arrange the pics is here the did from meaning
the have this pics together held so she the genuine space the these recording the all the proximity the grassi the canadian rockies done were correspond they see here elements by dias oder imaging and these things became everybody spatial relationship set
me weiß not exactly me yet time have them other environments show
is which the lot territorial are
i would gladly an the originals rows of noah showing and the is from an early prototype of the wir sommer worked have them that showing ich believe that realy the pointe behind this technology the is and is not absolutely apparently if man the environments considered the we at the site have
us us because the lawyers ensure making
is one reconstruction the cathedral notre queen the exclusively computer mit images from flickr give they easy notre checkers flickr one and you become pics by men and on the receive every this cones represented one image this as model discovers became
therefore are all and you everybody standing geographic to this way relationships
and we can to this very simplicity wise navigation
knowing she me have never believed that ich eventually bei microsoft work become
ich am very grateful for the reception here
me surmise she can see that many miscellaneous species from cameras are alles is of the professional one quite large quantity by them the all this surrounding became
and when possible become me some the locate
many of them are by faces undercover
anywhere here are a series of photograph here are you
is actually ein poster of notre queen this correct recorded became
we can by the posters an physical view this environs switch
the item is here that wir stuff mit the social surrounding can become now data from allen gathered by the collective memory like visually the soil looks and anything is associated
all this photographs become attached and emerges something the larger is als the sum the parts
they preserved a model that from the entire earth arises
contemplate she as the continued the work from stephen
and that is something the by the complexity with the the humans using grow and whose benefits for the user using the applicability always greater will
yours own photos be with metadata the a other person entered has
when anyone the toil done hat and all these saint has and communicates whos you all are then becomes mein photograph by the notre suddenly with all these data enriched and i can you als use these space dives this the photographs by other pax using and hence an kind from social experiences mit the exploitation of other providers do
and course byproduct all whose are the immensely wealthy virtual models by everyone interesting part the earth the not nur by or and continued received were thru collective memory
many thanks
understands ich they true your software enabled that an certain date inside the next years alle pictures the of someone the globe jointly used will principle linked becoming
she power nothin other als discovering
if she wanna creates she hypertext between the pictures
and you tut due des the pictures
and this is really exciting if you the plethora the information think the lots this images owning
as if they an for pics she phrases and the lyrics the site contains lots information which pic das is
but like would when das image she with all their images linked
then is the circumference the and the fullness the truly tremendous is ein
blaise das is truly amazing congrats
have they many thanks
i will them some stuff from my buch narrate the how ich hoping harmony mit others are the she already owned have and ich become try yourself ein couple links creating if them these not noticed are
i wants mit the begin what ich official dogma
das official dogma by what
the official of allen western industrialised companies
das offical dogma works if ours destination that maximising des ours citizen is goes pre everything by the maximising the freedoms des individual
the reason is that freedom even good is valuable sensible an precondition for this human
if people liberty have then each by us for yourself the things doing the our maximise and noone has for uns decide
the way liberty maximise is election maximizing
more choice people have more freedoms have she and more freedom they have more have she
is think i deeply our water anchored that nobody the meaning come would
and is also deep our lifestyle rooted
me become them some samples enter what uns modern advancement allows
is my supermarket no großer
i wants nur kurz somewhat about tell
gives my supermarket if she the different extra not and the they purchase could one great number own salad the case that none the the store for they right is
that is so as the supermarket is
and then walk you the transaction a stereo loudspeakers an radio amp and an electronic store gives many stereo appendices
we can million different stereo appendices compose aus the component the an business offers become
they must admitting that this one large selection is
other ranges the world the communications
gave a zeit as i one kid was couldn man each telephone providers have the man wished by bell kam
you have her telephones rented they have not bought
a episode whose was that das telephones never broke was
these tage are over
wir have now almost a infinity selections specially the world the phones
are the mobiles the futures
my fave is the the centre and crème torch
and should she das pending now nor not shop saw have can they sure be that you bald will
and what toot is brings human the shops run and this ask posts
knowledge she now what the answers to this question is
the response is no
is not possible one buy this not lots tut
other des life the very lots als this buy by are meets the same explosion the choices
healthcare is not longer the fall the united countries this they doc walk and the doctor say them what doing is
instead walk she doctor and the doctor says them wir could making or us could make
hat this advantages and hazards
has these perks and hazards what want they do
and she saying doc what shall i do
the phd says has this perks and risks and has perks and risk
what want you doing
and if you saying if she ich phd what would you do
the phd tells but ich am not she
das earnings is we calling patients autonomy that sounds how one good thing but the realities is an shifting the load the responsibilities for das meetings by rulings of somebody the slightly caucasian the doctor somebody the nothingness white and ill is and hence not the best constitution is one judgment meetings the patient
admits one marketing for medications for folks how she and me this when she ponder even sense makes coz wir you not purchase
why advertise you us if wir not buy can
the replies is they expecting by uns the phd next mornings and an changes the prescription beg
slightly like our identities is now an question the choice how this slide reveal should
us inheritors none identities we inventing you
and wir inventing us often new as us want
the that every tag if she morning awakening she decide must what for one type from person they sein want
reference on marriage and fam gab an time the the was that nearly every one had and the she quickly wie she couldn and then fast childs as she couldn
the single choice was wer not when and not what you afterwards deeds
nowadays is all easy have
me wonderful intelligent students and me give them % lesser labour as ich formerly did
and das not weil you less clever are and not because you less carefully are
is weil you with other employs are you question itself shall i wed oder not shall me now wed
should me later marriage shall i kinder have oder careers make
the are alles questions
and you be this ask answering unrelated the means all the roles make the ich them and no good my course wars
and the deed should she the tun are important question
labour we are blessed how karl has using the the uns enabled every min of everyone tag by each square on the planet works to on das randolph hotel
is btw an corner by the me nobody narrate become the this works
me become them not recount coz me using wants
so what meaning these incredible freedoms the choice wir have reference at labour decisionmaking meeting again and again and again we works should or not working should
us can ours kids soccer playing watching and us have our handy the one hip and ours blackberry others hip and ours laptops probable to lap
and too when she alle disconnected are each min the wir child mutilate question we us also should i these calling accept
should ich to this answer should me these epistle writing
and even when the reply the ask nope is is certainly her experiences des hers embossed very anders as would
everywhere wir large stuff and kleine things things and lifestyle life is one ask the election
and the globe the we lived saw out
so will i say gave some choice but not all was one question the choice
and the globe the we now leben sees aus
and the question is are that good oder news
the reply is
we know alle what good is so will me what poorly is
all this choices have two effects two negatives effects at humans
ein effect wisely is that paralyzes stead liberating
with many options out the man select may falls people very difficult even opting
ich become them a further example giving a study on investing volunteer pension
a colleague by mir had access on from vanguard the gigantic by approximate an millions and diverse workstations
and what they found was per ifs the the employers took the participating %
you offering ifs percentage fewer associates take part als when they nur offering would why
cuz ifs are the zur selections stand is severe opting what man choose shall that she to tomorrow defer
and then mornings and then tomorrow and mornings and mornings and morning come naturally nie
understanding they that das not nur das human food must if they the retire walk because she not enough money have means even das rulings meeting severe is that she great yours employers
by the not participation give you until pro year at by the the happily would their contributor
paralysis is an follow by many choices
and i thinkin cares that the world looks
you want the ruling realy right meetings when for alle eternity is correct
they wanna not the false fond choose oder gar the false
so the is the a effect the other effect is that myself when us the paralysis overcome and one judgment meet ends we fewer satisfaction using the results the selections als when we the option shoulda us intermediate fewer opportunities decide
and gives several causes for
one from them is conditionally by the great selections when they buy and is not perfectly and which is already perfect is just that she a other decision shoulda meeting can the better would and what happens is this figuratively alternate leads that she the ruling regrets and repent unfavorable to the happiness the you by yours ruling had also if an good decision was
more possibilities returns simple is even nothin repent the is disappointing for the choice the they meet
secondly what economist call
dan gilbert hat a large item today mornings done narrated how very the kind the us things rating depends what us comparison
good if very many alternative misgivings admits is just attractive properties of alternative the they exclude the makes she less happy using the alternatives the she elected have
here is an sample for the of them the no yorkers are sorry i myself
but here is what they shoulda think should
here is a pair at the hampton
very expensive property
strand tag they have anything for self
what could better sein damn the husband thinks is augustus
every my neighborhood is way
i might directly front my house
and spends week of the reflections prosecuted this the possibility missed hat tag above tag an carpark have
lowering the satisfaction the wir by ours selection receive too if that what us handpicked have fantastic is
and more opportunities zur selections is more attractive features this selection become the considered
here is one more sample
now this cartoon makes some testimonies
makes one assertion now living and maybe too stuff slowly do
but an important item the makes is allways whom you for a thing decide opting you others stuff not do
and this other stuff likes many attractive characteristics have and becomes what you tun become fewer do
thirdly escalate the expectations
hat myself hit as ich my jeans exchange wished
ich stretcher jeans almost the entire period
and gab one period the nur jeans one kind gab and she have she purchased and they have poor she goods incredible and if they she long enough wore and frequently enough laundered had have she starting
so walked neue jeans buying after many years des the alte and i told i shoulda gladly a couple jeans here is meine greatness
and the vendor said wanting you lean slight oder expanse
want they button oder zip stone or acid laundered
want she jeans mit
want she bottom far sliced and continuing narrated
mein jaw was downstairs and after i myself told i would happy the type the previously the single type was
had none hunch what das was so spent me one hour so everyone this damned jeans and dungeon das transaction and ich saga the truth mit the best matching jeans the ich had
ich had better all these choice me better have
but me felt mich worse
why ich wrote one whole buch trying me self explaining
the cause that me mich worse felt was using all these disposable possibilities mine expectation what for a good few jeans went high
me had very low expectations ich had none concrete expectations als you just an type gave
als they species came damn an of them woulda perfectly be should
and what ich gotten was fine but was not perfect
and compared i what ich get had the what ich awaited and what me had was disappointing comparing the what i anticipated
das add of opportunities the live the human increased inevitably the expectations the people have how good this options sein become
and conducts fewer satisfaction with the outcomes also when the findings good are
noone the globe des white weil when she would you alle not here goes
the truth is more wie das here
the cause is this earlier everything better was as anything poorer was as alles poorer was was for the humans possibility experience do the an pleasant surprises commodities
nowadays the globe the we lifestyle wir affluent industrialised citizen mit perfection as expectations this finest for that man hope can is the things well are as man of them expects
they be never pleasant cuz your expectation mine expectations are
this secret zur that is she alle came are das secrets zur are low expectations
ich wants tell an short moment das i using one ms wed am and they is truly very wonderful
coulda not better making can me got myself not settled
but settle is not allways one thing
finally one episode des one poorly sedentary jeans when just one type buying returns is that if you displeased are and she ask why who accountable is the reply clear is the world is accountable what shoulda they doing can
when hundreds by various species from jeans available are and they buying one the disappointing is and they ask why wer is accountable
is also sure that the answers at the ask is they
they shoulda better tun can
with diverse species of jeans windows is no apologize for bugs
and if people choices meetings and even if the outcomes the choices fine are feel she disappointed you blame even
clinical depressed the industrialist world the last generation
i believe a not the only but an this explosion the depression and too suicide is that people learn have the disappointing are weil your standards high are and then when she this experience yourself declaring must thinking she would yours guilt
and is that that uns generally better goes lens and us us worse feel
so let they mich they reminder
is das offical dogma the a the we everybody for true keeping completely false is is not true
returns no ask that something select better is as no but follows not this more selections better is as something selections
is one magical crowds i know not what is
ich bin me pretty safely that wir these dot long missed have the choice our improves
now as a principle ask me bin nearly done as a principle question the thing about the is the what all this selections enabled the industrialized companies is the material wealth
is many seats the world and we have of many by them owned theirs trouble not the large choice is
her problem is that they little have
so the stuff via the me speech are ein problem the modern wealthy western corporations
and what is frustrating and irritating is steve levitt has them yesterday tells as this expensive and tough not help is an wasting of cash
what me them is that these complicated decisionmaking is not simply this she not helping
you tun even hurting
they worry das us worse standing
if something from the what the people ours company enabled decisionmaking meet the corporations human little choice have postponed dignity would not just that lifestyle the people improves ours would even enhanced become
economists call an application
becomes ensure that allen better goes not only the arms cuz all these great selection uns
reading she pls these cartoon and an person tells what knows this seafood
they knowing nothingness possible
impoverished imagination one viewpoint the world and that is the kind how i first read got
more ich but more kam i the view this the seafood something white
because the truth is that if they that breaking that everything possibility is have she none freedom they have palsy
if you the breaking that alles possibility is reduce she the contentment
she boost the paralysis and lowering the satisfaction
everybody needs a
is nearly mit certainty bounded maybe too for the seafood definitively for us
but this be from an metaphorical is a recipe for misery and me surmise catastrophe
thank them
you know i got via some this projects already previous spoken via this human genome and what this imply might and above the detection newer groups by genes
actual start we from an new point we have the biology digitized and now trying us vom digital code one new phases the biology us new live shaping and build
we have always tried significant questions posts
what is lifestyle is somewhat ich belief that many biologists attempted have comprehension and the on diverse tiers
we have assorted approaches tried pending to the minimal components simplified
us have almost year digitized as wir the sequenced have the bills by the analog world the biology zur digital globe the computing
well attempt us questions wir living regenerate can oder wir new leben creating can aus digital universe
das is the card tiny organism mycoplasma the this smallest genome an species possesses the myself lab may and we have attempted us this using an nor smaller genome reach can
us have made to approximate hundred gene dispense by the oder the here are
but if us us these metabolic card viewing the very is comparison our trusted she me das is but when wir us everybody this genes watch the wir after the others exterminate can is very improbable that an cell lead would
hence have wir uns decisive that the only path after front is chromosome actually synthesize what us allows the individual component vary and therefore some this questions pose
and wir mit the question can wir an chromosome synthesize
enabled the chemistry this realy large molecule creating what yet never before done was
and if we this can can us this chromosome launch
ein chromosome is nur one play material
our steps at the digitisation des life commodities exponential
our capability genetic code writing hat very slow develops but anyway and unser last point dignity now on one exponential curve put
us have front years so begun
lasted indeed some years beginning using a before wir the first experimenting
how is very difficult
gives tens machines around the world the little tracks from dna can pending letters long but is a trial so longer man a play makes more mistake happen
so we one neue methodology developing using the us these small plays assemble and the errors correction couldn
that was unser first try beginning mit the digital information des phi
is ein lesser virus the bacterial kill
wir little chunks one and had one dna molecule by approx letter
the exciting phases kam as us piece chemical took and ein bacterium gave and the bacterium began the genetic code reading and made viral particulates
the particle were then by the cells released and came back and coli
recently got i with the spoke and you said that they models exactly
they more als her here toot
think we that that an situation is the software indeed the own hardware construct can a biological systems
but us still much continues go us an chromosome building hat more as letters genetic code wir us wir building cartridges from the greatness des virus wir the greatness the cassettes vary couldn understand what the individual plugins an cells are
design is the keys and if man with information computers starting want must this digital information really flawless his
als us that genome sequenced have was the in a errors per
wir found mistake when wir the originals sequence utilized shoulda would never possibility
ein part des designs is songs create the letters long are and the using others must minor building so this
we have unique elements here fitted
she have perhaps belongs that wir fitted have
thinkin she after we have a code and
this characters this letters encode approx amino and here is a single determination for each this amino
so can us the genetic code use ours words writing sets thoughts
initially have we just signed
some humans goods disappointed that no poetry was
us have the chunks engineered that wir she easy with enzymes disassembly couldn is enzyme the this repair and reunited
and wir have begun tracks creating commencing using the pending letter contained these making this again up
everyone crotch have wir this tracks excess produced so us she couldn because we tried a very robust process what she an min see become
us have tried item the automation
so the looks aus as a
if us these correct big using over then will these not easy coli waxing exceeds alle opportunities the modern molecular and us uns others mechanism
we knew of a mechanisms the recombination called is the the biology uses dna repair the such pieces may
here is a example is a organisms named the threes millions wheel radiation
you see upper field that his chromosome simply apart falling
up hrs later has everything reunited as was
wir have thousands organisms the das do can
this organisms can totally be you can even vacuum life
ich bin absolutely secure that lifestyle space existence and moving may to the searches to conditions
actual the nasa hat shown that much there outdoors is
here is a from the molecule this wir crafted have wir this lawsuits used have indeed have us just used with the design the songs have wir you yeast adds these then automatic together
the is no is a regular
is an big molecule that we even using the see can
that are recording above an length of seconds
this is the publications the us recent finished posed have
das are about letters code is das biggest molecule with structure that ever by human creating became
has one from via million
if we with one from and without gaps print would would sites comprise only these genetic code
well as start we an chromosome wie activate us
apparently is that with a virus very is is much complicate mit bacteria
is likewise easier when man how we are toot man takes easy the out and is one other and this is exactly this what they everyone above this cloning belongs have
at is this chromosome the cells integrates but recent have wir shown that man a complete transplants from one cell zur other may and these tick may
wir the chromosome one crude said are these two remove like humans and mouse we gave some so us chromosome pick couldn us using enzymes alle proteins destroying and was very amazing as we an cell gave and they becoming our very diagrams here estimation
that neue chromosome walked the cells
indeed we that here the end is but we have tries the process slightly further bringing
that is the the evolution here
wir finds all species from species here the an chromosome taken have or one by any once thousands characteristics nur one second one species
human so the evolution introduce als one gene this a date amended is have much by the biology missed
is enzymes the named become the indeed dna digest
the chromosome that the cells was hat none the chromosomes the us inserted have already
became the cell and recognized that others chromosome als materiel and had us ending just one cell with an new chromosome
blau because the genes the we inserted had
and to an very short time had everybody the specie lost and fully a neue specie based to the new software the we the cell given have
all proteins the membranes as we the genetic code was precisely the what wir transferred have
mag like blades but wir can we the moving stuff fairly dramatically modify
well have i argues that not the genesis is the based on billions yrs evolution
and me got argue that we possibly are one new shape the explosion creating the massive neue based to digital design enter might
why should wir das do
i think is pretty evidently at what us need
wir are from nine billions people the next years
my correlation posts i was year born
today are three human to planets for each the year exists hat inside by yrs will vier be
wir have trouble using with and water medicines petrol for billions human
becomes one challenge this for
us needing via fünf billions ton dough billions kegs the are hundreds million kegs tag
if we via biological lawsuits reflection or process das replace becomes one huge challenges
then course returns that entire of materiel das the ambience
wir have now from ours discovery aus the entire world one databank with approximately million genes and i wants belive that this the the futures are
the electronics had a dozen constituents and see she the plurality the arose
us bumping here first line the frontiers the biological realities and ours introductions
wir have today technology due this fast this do what wir combinatorial genetics call
us have now the opportunity one major robots build the million of chromosomes day can
if they introduce these millions diverse gene oder this lawsuits optimizing oder medications new vaccines we can with a nur small team more molecular changing as the last year sciences
and is nur selections wir can to viability select productions from chemicals oder and continues
this is one admission of the wir works using the man indeed and neue specie computer know
knowledge they us knowing not absolutely how looks becomes wir knowing precisely as whose code looks becomes
us concentrating us well to propellant the fourth generation
she have recent maize ethanol spotted what easy ein experiment is
we have fuels the and third generation the relative soon becoming the much higher have become as or different types by butanol
but like wir thinkin the sole type so biology one big influence without more increase the costs on foods oder the restrictions from theirs availability have is is when we as feedstock see and therefore works us cells the these away go
and we thinkin that we the first with the fourth generation his will and the approx months
sunlight and are a methodology
but our discovery the world have wir everyone types methods
das is a organisms the we described have
lives the approximate mile deep bei virtually
transforms methane at the utilization from hydrogen als
wir examine we using can which just brought become could converting that fuel these process
inside an brief interval belive us we could the situation his a the basic question des life solving
knowledge they us have really moderate aims as the substitute the petrochemical industrie precisely if man that not bei ted doing might otherwise an the energy become
but equally works we currently the same approaches for the development from vaccine
you have year mit the flu viewed us are always one year aft tuned and have one $ little if the vaccines goes
i thinking that the altered be may man recombinant vaccine created
this is like the futures maybe appearance could using changes may today the accelerated be mit synthetic bacterial and possibly
wir are removes human improving our destination is only that we an chance have long enough survival das maybe do many thanks
on the last ted conference gab ich one introduction lhc
and i promised back coming them explain like the engine works
now is so and for all the then not goods the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment which tackled became miles diameters
its assignment is the prerequisites created what lesser als an sec to onset des universe existed and das bis million once inside one sec
is simple just stunning ambitious
is the engine below by lausanne
we take pics this detector at
ich atlas detector metre the breadth metre diameter
here an bild des atlas the construction so she the see
sept year walked the machines first mal
and bild was of atlas recorded
caused immense cheering
is a pic des first which the entire route the lhc then purposely using a part des lhc collided a regen from particles to the detector letting
other words als us picture sept saw knew us that the machinery works what an großer triumph is
i white not the largest cheers generated or as someone the google page attended and the home
signifies that us an cultural influence besides the scholarly reached
approximately an weekly later gave ein trouble using the machines which using these here doing had this gilded wire here
these wires guiding amps if the engine on expires
now the engineer under them be they contemplate and say no the doing they not that are small wires
they can the afford because when man they very far becoming you
bei minus grad so colder als the room between the stars can this wire the voltage endure
one the compounds intermediate above magnet lhc gave one
thereby the wires negligible and amps suddenly resist
was das result
now the everything is still when you introduce that the magnet about tons weighing and postponed
we so approx the magnet
and you remove what us also deeds
us she new she
she are now all reunited on way back
against ends march is the lhc reunited functional be
us becoming him and expecting first dates june oder july collect can and set ours voyage fort what the blocks des universe are
well naturally to a kind sparking such accidents again the debating the value of sciences and such borders is easy slightly
ich think the fact that heavy is the fact that wir on ours boundaries beyond grip the worth of wie the lhc
ich will my words an researcher humphrey davy the how i surmise as the experimentation defended sein apprentice was michael faraday told nothing is hazardous for the development des human humanities als that our scholarly perceptions final are that none the natur gives that ours triumphs are and that none new worlds conquer gives
many thanks
ich am writer
books write is my occupation but is naturally more als this
is also my große lifelong dear and fascination
and ich expecting not that this change will
however, is something my leben and my career happening das myself brought has my reference this work complete rethink
peculiar occurrence was that me recently one books wrote have a biography named love das decidedly anders as everybody my books out reasons the world and ein big became
das result is that ich whatever where i coming treats become as would i the doom sanctified
serious the woe dedicated
sample come they quite worried to myself and say afraid they not that she these success ever surpassing will
have they none angst before that you you whole living and nie again one books created that the globe cares nie again
ok das power realy courage
would however worse when ich myself not reminder dignity that i pre above years as ich as teen first times recounted that me novelist be wished using the equal kind by reaction confronting worden bin
the guys said did no scared never success have
did no anxiety that dich the disgrace one rejection
did none angst that crafts your leben lang and never something arises and that on a dream die your mouth stuffed mit the bitter ash des
approximate they knowledge already
the response the short response to all this questions is
me have fear prior all these
and the had i always
and ich got pre still lot more scared the nobody would
as seaweed and others things
but if letter goes thinkin me since after and question me why
is the sensible
is logic that by somebody expected becoming should that angst before hat the labour doing the professions feels
and what exact is mit the creatives endeavors los that she uns unsafe above the reciprocal making an kind as other profession not doing
my dad example was chemist and ich may myself none situation his yrs as chemists remember the asked was scared coulda chemists sein
using yours john wie goes you so
kam just not before knowledge you
but fair his the gruppe the chemist have via the centuries not the reputations from people received
we authors shining but these kind of reputation have but not only the writer the creatives aller genre seeming these reputations have mental monster unstable be
all what they doing must is the bitter of realy heads solo aus the century the young and often by own palm
and even the not indeed suicide rails from their talent truly neglected worden his
norman mailer said briefly front his death his last interview every mine books hat myself a bit continues slain
an extraordinary testimony the you on you making can
but wir twitch not once when us somebody slightly tell listening coz wir this kind by testify since long time know kinda have we the and collectively accept that creativity and suffering kinda naturally and that arts ending always zur conducts
the question the me today each here posts wants is is these idea for they totally order
feel you so probably because using nur a centimeters spacing considered i feel myself using this even not probably
me find they
and me find they dangerous and ich will not how you ins next jahrhundert will
i find better if wir our major creatives living
and me weiß definitely that for me mine situation very risky would these path the conjecture especially the circumstance the me me my careers just
this see you me am fairly young ich am only years old
i got perhaps nor more mir
and is extremely probable that anything what i from now write will of the world as the labour assessed will the after the successes last came true
ich saga because us are here now everyone somehow buddies is highly probably that mein biggest success behind me lies
jesus what for an thought
this are the type by thought the somebody bring can clock mornings gin drink and this want i not
me would dear continued these labor tun the i dear
so is the question wie
after time des shines mir that me continues letter can an kind from psychological designing must
kinda must i from well a away find letter a secure distances between mir and my very natural as the response at das written be is
during i year after models wanted have das doing have i also the history searched and i got tried others companies finds see they possibly better oder ideas had as us like man creatives helping can using the emotional hazards the using creativity linked are
this search led myself ins old greece and this alte rome
please episodes you me because the circle is again closes
but alte greece and rome have the people not believed that creative by humans arrives okay
she believed that creative a type was the out one remote source the people comes out unexplainable reasons
the greeks these divine the creativity demons
of socrates is known that believed would an daemon the him out continue remote
the roman had the equal idea this type by ghost ein genius
the is great the romans not really that one genius ein specially individual was
she believed that one genie these type magical creatures was of the believed became that the lives approximate wie the the and the performers bei the labour invisibility and this result the labour shaping would
that is is is the distances from the ich spoken that psychological the you by the consequences yours labour shooters
and anyone knew that functioned correct
the performers des was prior consciences protected wie example lots narcissism true
if yours labour was not alles see for dich every knew that genie this dir assisted has
when yours labor not your bug oder
everyone knew your genius was something lame
have the human westen truly lange period over creative imagined
and then came the renaissance and everything changed us had this große idea and these große idea was uns the human individual ins center des universe posts above alle gods and and returns space more for mystical creature the command from divine assume
is the commencement des rational humanism and the humans began belief that creativity fully of own individual came
first times the history listening man human these oder artist an genius call instead that a genie has
me must them tell me think the was one großer error
knowing you i think an bare person enable that thinks or she sei how the vessel like das pools and the essence and the source allen divine creatives infinity is one small bit lots responsibility they an human psyche
is like someone pleas the sunshine swallowing
das deformed and distorted entire egos and creates all these expectations the successes
me thinking that this our artist the last years destroy hat
and if das right and ich thinkin true is the question
can us change
maybe an sympathy over the relationship intermediate human and the des creatives
might not
perhaps can wir that aus years rational humanism not simply an lecture exterminate
and admits sure human audience the truly scientific doubt subscribe would via the presentation by fundamentally fairy the human and at their project apply
ich will likely not everyone by them on this trip can
but the ask the ich wants is why not
why not thinkin
because makes equally lot meaning as all others by the me belongs got when therefore walked the absolute insane des creatives declare
a trial the wie everyone know the attempted hat slightly making so others words actually anyone here not always rational behaves
the tat may sometimes downright
me had recently a such encounter as me the extraordinary american poet ruth stone met the now on is the but ihr whole life long poet was you told mir that they as she virginia outdoor to the worked they told she dignity feel and hearing can like ein poem above the scenery to you
you told would wie a train aus aerospace
the via das land to you dignity
you felt when came because dignity the soil unter their earthquake bring
she knew that she a such moment nur do could and das was their words race how the devil
they as the hell houses during they of poem tracked became went only wherefore that you quick enough an sheet paper and a stylus so they when thru you capture and to the sheet hold couldn
bei other paint was they not quickly enough they and and but you achieved das house not and this poem through they and they you said dignity further above country pulling and how she said after a others poets find
and then gave this moments the part become me nie forget you said that moments gab they nearly
so they runs haus and searches after the paper and the poem drives thru you and they grabs a pin straight als thru you and then said you was as dignity using yours others hand after grab and pack wars
they that poem his dick and moved return their body and at the sheet paper
at these occasions kam that poem flawless and intact to the paper but backwards from last word first
as i this heard thought me this is uncanny the is exactly like mein trial
das is even not as mein process ich am not the kanal
me am one mule work can must me any tag zur equal zeit and sweating me and really uncomfortable
but even me my got sometimes ding grazed
and i guess that many from them this even done have
itself ich had work or ideas the aus one source through myself the me truly not identifying can
what is das for ein ding
and as kicking wir so relationship excl our minds lose us contrary even in health keeping
for me is this best living example like man creating may the musician tom me him pre some yrs for a magazine
we languages over topic and know they what the period life was tom the embodiment des modern the tried this uncontrollable creatives stimulus the he dominate and using them
but then became older and calm recounted me that day to one freeway los angeles drove and changed all for him
drove mit hoher speed als suddenly an lowercase fragments one melody hears the like in inspirations frequently is for him severe tangible is and wants they have you is afterward but can you not apprehend
has no slice paper has stylus hat
starts so these old he ascend wie i will thing loses and become of song on forever persecuted become
me bin not well enough ich not
but instead panic guessed overheard easy to
ended the entire and tat somewhat fully new
glanced just the skies and told apologize can not see that i car
ich aus als could me straight a song
when realy exist come an moment reunited if me mich you can
when not today anyone others
go and leonard cohen
be hat then changed
not the work even the was continues frequently dark like and
but the process and the heavy the ihn surrounds was repealed as that genie from took nothingness as anger caused and him recognized that not ding his
could one miraculous bizarre collaborative giving an kind conversational intermediate tom and the thing that not quite tom was
als ich this story belongs got too a bit the kind how me cooperated and has myself already once saved
these idea rescued mich as me from love was ich fell a this pits des the us everybody falling when we somewhat work and not mindset that a catastrophe is this is the worst buch that posted became
not nur badly des worst aller time
me begun mindset ich should this projekt simply
but then recalled ich me as tom the free heaven spoke had and i tried
i lifted so my view of manuscript and spoke my comment direction an emptying corner des
ich talked according ding and ich knowing both if books not brilliantly is that not completely my blame is correct
because that ich alles what ich got me have not more as this
if so better have here and percentage the deal adhere
okay but when that not what then satan so
i will anyway further writing because that is my job
and i wants pls log giving that me today for my part des jobs here was
because ending is how follows before centuries have the deserts people using saints and musik gather the held became to zur dawn
this solid commodities always great because the dancers wares professionally and she were fantastic
but hin and back very rare happened something special an the actor was indeed
and me weiß that you knowledge what ich meine because i know that she alle lifestyle already once one such watched have
was als dignity the time and the dancer through an type gateway kick tat nothin anders as earlier done has night earlier but alles added together
and quite suddenly appeared not more longer rein humane
became by inside and by downstairs and all thru an flame
als slightly then happened knew the people what that was they at his name
she the hands together and began chant allah allah god gott gott god
the is gott know you
interesting historic footnote als the conquered brought they these custom mit the debates altered the centuries by allah allah allah olé olé olé that man allways still in and listen
if ein performers seville something something magical done hat god olé olé god great bravo inconceivable is ein fugitive view to lord
and this is great because us needing that
but the part follows next morgen if the dancers self wakes and recognises that pm an tuesdays is and not longer ein of gosh bears
is merely one using knees and perhaps is never reunited these altitude ascend
and might becomes never again anybody god name call if rotates but what shall then using the remainder life start
the is difficult
that is one the revisions creatives life
but maybe must not quite crowded torment be if you of beginning not believed have that the aspects hers of them
if she might nur beliefs that she a are from an source for a time hers life the anyone others disclosed will when they ready so are
when us start ponder this alles
got me begun think and thinkin i with security the month while ich the book cooperated this bald appear becomes als the dangerous strongly expected successor success
what i me continuously self say must if ich crazy become is got none angst
be not discouraged
make simply job
be continued for post what too always his may
when your job the dance is dance
if the divine genius this dir zur page posed is opts for a brief moment one by wonder by your effort reveal then olé
and if not dance nonetheless dancing
and olé for you spite
i believe and ich have that emotion we should that lessons
olé for dich spite simply that the mere human love and the did be
thank
thanks
olé
last year have me this two transparencies shown illustrate that the the for approximate three million years the height the lower countries had percentage shrank is
but expresses not strong enough the seriousness aus not the thick des show
meaning is the the cardiac ours global
she grow winter and shrinks sommer
the nearest foil the me them show is an what the last yrs happens is
that is with rot marked
like she see growing on this tagged is the annual eis winters and shrinks sommer
the five years old oder older is nearly as blood which from the body here
years becomes by here after here gone be
is one problem the warming the grund the oceans the grosse volumes carbon gives which if by microbes methane transposed will
compared mit the sum the ambiance might this amount doubled when we these critical point exceed
already today some shallow lakes alaska methane by even aus the water
prof walter the university alaska is with an further workgroup a other shallow see last winter traveled
wow
you goes fine the question is how is us
and a grund is this enormous warms greenland aus the northern
is a
but the volumes are substantially bigger as previously
is the river southwest greenland
when she know want wie the thru climbs here they ins seaside
this rivers take
others ending des planets the antarctic the largest on the planets
last monthly researchers that the totality continental well a negatives has
and the the on one couple surfaced is is especially stark melt
conforms feet as greenland
himalayas the see she upstairs neue lakes the before one couple yrs glaciers wares
% aller people to the globe getting the half hers out meltwater
the andean is this glaciers the for these city
the have
but when they will also that potable
california was a reduction the the sierra saw
affects the
and the forecasts like they they reads have are ernest
this the entire globe conducts one dramatic increase firing
and the disaster anywhere on the world have an realy and prior never extent
many the last years how the
is ein completely
when she historical correlation consider can they see what
the last yrs have we million ton manufactures everyone hrs millions tonne every day the oceans
look you the domain des eastern pacific exactly from american continents westerly and des indian one drastic downturn des the gives
the widest single factor for the global warming besides deforestation which % is this burn from fossil
is ein trouble and charcoal is this nevertheless widest trouble
the united countries are a the both together mit china
and the suggestion was lots further build
but us begin a change see
here are the the the last years canceled were mit some greens alternative the proposed became
gives one political controversy land
and the and have one dollars last issued dough apply what already a contradiction is
picture remembered me slightly
xmas around in mir tennessee a billions ton out
you have the news seen
is entire lands the
happened xmas
one the commercials the xmas was this
the is a jolly chap
him admits shell and fill america and helps ours business growing
the will each tag cleaner
is and lovable and workmen stay reward and loaf
is the source the most coals west virginia
the miners is the leader from massey
letting they me quite sure say gore nancy harry reid she know not she speeches
so has the alliance for mitigation two campaign ins living called
is one one part by your
at the see we als one serious threat for unser shop
hence have we uns supreme zeil set a considerable an to the away bring the truth over charcoal
fact is coals is not filthy
we beliefs they is clean and smells even yet fine
so make she none worry the
they this quiet uns
coals they have much owns
so letting you us an tour this modern making
fantastic these machine is quite loud
but is the sound the
and yet das incinerate of charcoal one the for the global warming is the notable the they here see anything
look they exactly is the todays
finally mixes the affirmative alternative with our economic challenge and ours challenges the national collateral
america is one crisis the economics the national safety the
the red thread the these everyone combines is ours addiction of as filthy dough and
but now admits an brave new solution us aus this lage liberating
america mit % cleaner electric new within the next year
one plan americas return zur labor bringing us safer making and help the global warming halt
finally an solving the tall enough is ours problems solve
americas new locate she more
is the latest
goes a by americas
an the quickest ways ours dependency by old the our globe suffocation reduces
the futures is here winds sun and an new
new investments good paid employment create
americas new is time reality accepting
gives one altes saying if swift be go solo
if far come go together
we must far come and admittedly quick
many thanks
ich wants so begin you pleas the time yours infancy as she with
while they wie man the hands and the and moved you actually superior and troubles thru this understanding and changing territorial correlations resolve
the spatial thinkin is tight so associated wie us a bulk our environment comprehension
as scientist inspired by the type our interactions with real objects together mit my patti and my coworkers begun me me miracles what would when we computers usefulness would the instead the as a digital on an shallow desktop moving what would when we with both hands intervene could and dates physically seize and she arranging could like wir wanna
these question was that wir uns zur exploration the replies decidedly and developed
briefly said a is a interactive computing the height
they can with the palm moves will they can mutually perceive she can your movements capturing and she have an screen and a
lots important are are bodily why man she wie only by das the hands and accessing moving may
and the are one examples one new generation of zur manipulations data
and if this utilities bodily be and ein awareness for your motions developing mutually recognise and the subtleties ours mit them perceive then can we mit the exploration newer and begin
ich mit some simple examples
this is for the configured and when me ihn an direction will das videos forward played if i ihn the others direction expires backwards
and these interactive portraits take mutually true
if ich they so put awakens das you interested
when she surrounded are they das too and can somewhat jumpy becoming
and she feel also its movement and inclination
one interesting episode the engagement the we acknowledge began was that wir gestures on data apply could how about colors how man mit fluid toot
fall have wir threes als configured and ich can they harness colours the the mid gießen they then blended will
if us exaggeration can we a little
gives also even some options the formation how language mathematics or us the the possibility des fast enter and the results instantly see wanna
here bin i that is an the ich using a simple create
that is one game using das an kind mixing out scrabble and is
fundamentally gets man every lap at each random allocated letters and while man tried words forming be this over one dictionaries reviewed
then after approx seconds will reunited blended and man hat a neue and new options
many thanks
the are some kinder the to a trip lab came ich could you moving and have one video taken
they have truly loved
a interesting circumstance in this type from applications is that man the not many instruction enter must
everything what man say must is words and she know exactly what doing is
here are still one couple folks the testing
that is our youngest there bottom right
posed that the only stacking wanted
so for him wares you nur
is an interactive
wir a for developing
das is felix
may new characters the scene bring the from tisch the these character show
here lets the sunshine
the sunshine goes on
now holt a tractor the scene
the tractors
good labor
the shake and they lays can the characters interacting letting
his own story inventing
hi
is a history using ending and can opting like they evolved
flying cats
das final example for this ich today period got showing is an for the wir recent developed have and the as tone as bass and drums
every has vier different variations man may selecting which man harness wants
and man can this sounds the sequence the man patterns arranging can
and man you a man just a one lasts
there are effects the man live changing may like hall and filter
man combines ihn mit an certain audio and tends him then setting
and then nor effect how pace and volume the man to the totality sequence
so look wir times
us start the we the two and these an series arranging you broaden and one bit more the vote adding
now add i a bass
now become me still slightly drums tun
and now connect i the filter with the drum so ich the effects live taxation can
i may the whole sequence accelerate ich that pace the a oder others direction
and now connect i the filters yet with the bass for slightly more phrase
ich may the sequence during she surround
thereby must i you not apron planning can improvisation she meanwhile renew or shorten
and may ich the entire sequence hide me the to links
many thanks
as you so see can lies my enthusiasm herein neue evolve the better the fit as our brain and bodies works
and today had i period them one part this new and some the possibilities whose reveal wir laboratory work
the thought the me them using on the path enter wants is that wir the threshold this new generation by zur engagement using digital media stand the information ours world bringing the ours demands conforms
many thanks
me me at the talks with them allen
good tag
ich mich that ich am
so what should be
me must mal an bit and although employs just with the modern molecular
me molecular and myself just now since a pair years using the and das have i begun cuz me simply exact knowing wished and before everything also yourself do wanted what me study theoretically learnt have
that was my primary motivation
so was an curiosity and ich wished kinda closer ran the matter
ich thinkin that the molecular general now so ganz general talked biotech all what man counting synthetic biology and continues
extreme important is now already extreme important is and still lot lot important be will future
is things like this entire genetically planting to the
admits now craig venter the the tries so gasoline out seaweed
unter then is even already things the totally everyday arrived are what the most but gar not conscious is examples the us permit using forty grad lingerie wash are also genetically optimised enzyme
and the listing may man endless resuming
and so aus the interested this this tech bin me just continued continued
what why now hacking
the most know the most peeps know that from the
computers chopping and then will the media always the hacker break someplace a and claws dates and continued
that is kinda for the very sad coz this gar not das meets what they actually how the actually started has and what actually behind stands
and although have the the seventies using begun and is too the internet arose
and goes therefore using on an creative kind an trouble resolve
and trouble that is not just a problem may even one trouble be may even simply a be what like stuff simplifying so a arbitrary problem one ask and wie can man the anders oder how may man that better do
and became just is hold using software but is too returns too an entire the using all possible stuff making
and now just halt too direction biology and wants me these metaphor the halt from the synthetic biology arrives take that biology actually a is weil the code is one code the is not quite equals as computing weil dynamic is cuz matter so genuine matter is and not only cyber
but is even a code and the may man too programming and appropriately may man ihn too hack and this found i find i incredible fascinating and wished me simple lots lower with boarding
that has actually eights truly mold adopted these these network
is dot org that is initially aus the switzerland that is with europa and with one collaboration india networking this but meanwhile membership or active folks everywhere on the globe has
this are the has a more artistic alignment so goes are lots artist and philosopher and cooperation mit scientists so employed just with these technology and question posts and that creative returns and alles potential
but goes actually always therefore one a accessibility locate an dealing have so
and then is dot org
das is aus the one networking that is actually more a kind forums man halt meets and online discussed
the are one bit technical oriented and also an bit will then too applied questions posed
and of these networking the the entire popularity made have has hold a scene developed the ich kurz once wants
here picture links top sees man das is an so principle a type schule one private schooling charitable verein setup everybody can
kids alte everybody possible folk going simple so she have ein labs established and look what may man do when this
here left downstairs is one group indonesia the the is but already quite lange
already longer as this others both networking
the employ too a artistic aspect mit biological materials and too and combine das on quite type
one group out ankara the me pre an while times have the have that is a the halt gladly the public more convey wanted what what you the uni learn and the have on small promotions done and tried explaining what is
and i got upstairs at the others pic a lecture copenhagen museum combination mit one expo theme
and das is this is das are mostly law kid people but das sole what what one what actually everyone combines is this fascination the technology
and what man so do may and just even ganz targeted on the gesellschaft so and question ok what her what what her join your interested so
now biology hoes needs man somewhat materiel
man needs course biosafety material and man needs but too tooling and das is then an labs
what man normally under an laboratory understands that are somehow machines extremely pricey extreme detached only for academic using phd and further
and ours approaches was just hold say that actually must man this not making
the is actually not needed cuz each every every has actually higher developed tech als the most that is really
and with this premise with this premise hat then example brian england attempted one has then a taken a and and hat so then bacterial farmed works
so everyone the already once an soup is the long stand complacent hat even already mal made
ich have the then my laboratory tried a bit and have mir then hold on ebay bought and a bit analyze done tried a so yet once making
that should now actually gar not jokes sein but
here bottom the image looks man is this lab so is a garage mit also everything possible the the uni has a group paris the what what configured hat and quite succesful so is and also quite interesting things makes will me also nor a project short incision
and the here is the just also mentioned one kind principle for for molecular biology
and so man looks is relative relatively heterogeneous so the is halt by the das solo making bis hin big so larger organizations the halt das more formally also already mold already operate
but just always always the the approach that hold simple and accessed his shall
this first projekt the us as internationale gruppe done have als we uns quasi ours even deliberately were gives uns now here as scene even and wir are online and we us know the guys the allways chat and
and then kam just by the org websites the founders and has said us must us now too mal realy meet also real meetings and hat then two events organizes one london zehn and briefly the san francisco
and went then even wherefore wer are we what want we what wanting wir too what want we
and what what are ours values and what are what is ours objective ours base
and have we then an elaborated
this was law intuitive so each has easy his wish its and das what ihn hold moves expressed then
came my opinion after one quite good code
and the have wir then the is not authentic but das is hold ich thinkin already hat comparatively good enforced the peeps are law convinces from
and wir have then even tries this also the academic globe back but there is somehow not arrived
so ich belief we out the are the even already one step continued als the the academic world
what for project making us now actually
ein project the me mit the the switzerland even made got was that us a optics trap oder optics forceps crafts
this is when man an focuses on an space then may man so little particles capture the air oder the fluid and then focus moving so the is then captured so how a like a principle
the works realy das is academic done and wir have then imagined this wars we perhaps even hin have then one webcam taken the the lens flipped then hat man ein microscope that magnified approx
the sees man down
and then have us a burners and the burners the lasers and then tries at this cam focusing
and the has unfortunately not but us have still much learned
one else project das from from the french group out paris das hat this is fairly cool
and although hat an a a or something so hat mit neurobiology occupied his be is sam
hat then these these helmet crafting and the cooperation using the museum is das ran
couldn then the visitors the space at these stool put these helm
then became its measured and after what she imagined have oder wie they imagined have is are then different lights space tackled
was one pretty quite project
ein else thing aus the us that just even with this do has is the the the is the word
so goes wherefore just genes copied fragments so man they visible do may
so if ich now this do the the profiler scene walk then hin gathering and then make the these then this method and then can she saying hair owns humans
and the machines the something make the are fairly expensive the man commercial buys the cheapest walk at euros los
and the is halt not but is a realy cool technology the even very much may
so the is nur a applicability of many the man so making can
and the have have two two and said the make we simpler and cheap and have then just out open so free hardware this device and are now the have the even zur brought and are now the the cheapest providers from these globe
ich believe somewhat dollar oder slightly
but to each case is now is always yet not cheap but is on any fall an frameworks yet distinctly is
so is mine opinion to a very hack
ein projekt the me started had was an construct
is as one kind the shoots approx far two cm oder
man invites on and the then this and then me have the then to onions shot and got the then glow brought so
so that appliance that man looks that hat not works
but the is my mein prototype the but pretty sailed has on a ast that thing electronic and pressure affiliated and this was but the pressures was up that thing is broke departed
and then got ich an taken and the connected
ein when man the fully power with water has the enough printing so me belief forty until bar about
and so may man then the particulate strong enough acceleration and then walk the too the onions purely
and the commercial appliance about euro upwards oder something the fifty
so the has not the same effectiveness but is principle halt feasible
and das is hold moment even that that the scene just this availability by tech increase and even the information and the comprehensibility increase that that more peeps can
because like early said is an extremely important technology and the most guys have relative little hunch and even even none chance truly good forming
cuz when man just reads aus that is not that same as if man yourself once made or saw hat
and ich thinking technology becomes always important ours modern corporations
and if man als citizen too meaningful judgments the gesellschaft meetings can will and can want then needs man the accessibility knowing and zur tech
and and man must also do and comprehend making and understand can
and the then unter the open and sci
so that just man als citizens the lage transferred is just with these scholarly technology
and that is the this from of the
that are the people the officially inscribed have to the web website
the is already a comparatively considerable num of world
and interesting is too that they even represented are
that is i belive the are are fewer folk inscribed as indeed existence
so ich white by some the not entered have
and this are now just the the people
partial also using these so these together there entered
and that is but quite early
how told has started
and so the the berlin was the first
and that is meanwhile ein network very good became the anywhere at the globe represented are
and wir hope naturally that wir halt uns then similar even spreads and then too similarly well interconnected are that halt too more tuned people involved become can
and me would any once inviting so and even mal yourself what
is admittedly now not but is too not impossibility if man enough curious has and enough power then comes man even far
many thanks listen
the was
hello
how functioning wir people actually
that is one ask the myself very moved as but too area usability and prior allen section
goes therefore how man people interactive media encountered so you this interactive media use can and so you a preferably adventure create
me belive namely that the interactive media uns archaic cognitive models so the biological memories pre very very langer zeit worden are and that wir the just straight by interactive media again evoke can
and the is very amazing because man actually believes that these the man encountered that the an actually the futures bring but actually is that the futures exact bei uns is bei our root
what are because now actually archaic models
me got once four keywords and wants the gladly short declare
cognitive models and although are that the models the we the time uns have
these models heard that we a basically natural ratio zur have
das sounds basically uncommon
me become but equal again and will them per experiment proof that also she an natural ratio zur have
the second aspect is that wir since due this models the lage are very very figuratively speak though we nowadays one codified speech using
and the third section the declared actually from even
wir know alle that the interactive media via defining are what the the linearity contains and what us naturally tells that wir the linearity today as usual
the fourth point is that the history for uns ein location the is
like is that now using the mit the the actually the thing the world is
i want them that happy mal proof
doors has the home the they housing
das will we she mir not immediately spontaneous answering can but is happen and happened just moment
she going thru haus you living and look like many gates are
and exact the is what you make
she the realities and although ganz without computers
fantastic oder
and giving wir us toil the virtual reality portray can we that actually the whole period already
and this wealth the virtual the realities the have the human the times also bitterly necessary because the had gar nothin
the had none books
oder the had none no
she had no
this sole what the had was ihr head
and capita played the alarm
capita was knowledge retrieved and this virtual pictures the became just became know too passed
and is also strong uns rooted that we using the fine circumvent can
that interesting is if me once a kleine excursion make may
das goes
this interesting is that this zeit the gosh simultaneously and medium yourself was
if she now mal a continued thinkin
what are today media
then become you that one modification given has
but come me equals again speaking
utility the are since storytelling
priests commodities extra seconded knowledge stories conserve
and too today hanged we yet very very strongly storytelling
the author des storytelling jonathan wir allways still annually hrs using the concierge from stories
das means for an kid das bis reaching des the the the zeit life using the receptionist from histories spent hat
now thinkin us ours love tales hangs that wir als kid to the lap ours parental have
nope nope far
this goes lot continuing back the cultures the time
for myself but sector the interactive media as especially impressing is that we via biological memory anchored have the ability thinking
ich got them an sample brought from the tribe the
and the living lived the by columbia
and wie she see can is the ein very zone and man somehow navigating of island isle come nutrition procure
and the have this mit referred made
the know you might even already when you one bit from the australian
the have similar principles
the have no the have the used oder even
and what das interesting is that the navigating and the topography by regions about songs mapped will couldn
the language subordinate from rank was
das man about sounds and over rhythm
and these sounds and this tempo have the geology the topography one region depicted and that has course also allows that man this songs couldn and anders assemble and to left to right and too again back moving could
why chant wir but not more by top from to come
anyways not navigation
what what is actually happening
happening is das that
we have us previously referred moved
happen is das and happening is the book and happens is the is the
and admittedly precisely the is happens that we the accountability for ours memories and the the own productions ours reminders relocated have at external media
at the buch and on the picture
hence have us sadly god an play far
is suddenly stranger for uns strangers became and has using the realities nothing more tun
bruce brown ein acquaintance the is far departed say that this means the book and this bild so not the tv this internet and continues what wir as today denote that these ours reminders have and ours ability have
do we one kleine
of
what has influences at our on ours think and at ours
then are this influences the crops
and the becoming are the centuries more and more overridden worden by the influences des
this instead us individually reminder have wir standardized far widespread bulk disseminated patterns of memories the us our personal memory hang can
wir produce not more self
us have an abstract one language
us pose us the thing not more pictures the stuff not more pictures pre we you you our languages
us have us accustomed that stuff linear happen
and us have the linearity as act accept and returns nur yet exclusions how the
what uns stayed is is the storytelling
still always are we the storytelling als very very strongly arrested
the ask is what coming now
us had the vogt we got had this and we well das
that listens very and listening very to i caucasian
but these conceptions des the bring uns these these possibilities back return ours abilities reunited discovering
goes goes goes storytelling
i will this briefly mal ein bit declaring
is technical conceptions like the das the enhanced reality
so when she once google then then is an approach what uns the virtual globe with the real world reunited combine lets this our affinity zur virtualization that virtual as slightly normal natural becomes reunited raised
a other sample is the virtual reality
mad that course context sounding mag moving we us physically not virtual worlds quite after the model des
and other a other example are the intelligent systems
the are rooms the smart to an people react can
all that needs the capability ours ability als one real habitats accept
me have conclusion and ich hope this video works one very very project brought das is the from michael burk krenz joris and muller
and the two latter are also today here
perhaps you kurz mal so you the recess using the both over the projekt entertaining can
and project have me as example brought like again this cognitive models addressed becomes
this entire is a gameplay must ich tell
what the storytelling course extreme and is ein
and when i saga then have she very probably pre eyes that folk pre consoles oder that they mit the mit dashboard the palm playing
to any fall that she that doing
das is an games for outdoors
and this is targeted imagined that i the explore so that ich the real world reunited discover
and games connects the virtual world so the dates the the we producing mit the real world
ich apologize mich that ich stark must
your das then equals much better declaring still more lots more behind
and although goes wherefore that me an cities discover ich watching what positivity oder negative was
and get me from the town an quite others sight one ganz other impression namely me negatives and positives zones one city and get at these type and way a ganz other virtual map of an very real town
and that can wir uns now happy once
what man here see may apologies is yet a little declaration from the what you equals see
naturally resides these virtual globe the wall ours cities is clearly
and using one kind flashlight can wir this virtual worlds visible make
i das gladly mal merging my my talc and although the senses that the characteristics and the skill the wir out the vogt purchased have and the uns an bit went are that the mit aid des referred cyber again activates become can and that us on this type and wise over complex technological neue products actually not the futures actually us return ours roots come
many thanks
me myself very bei them be
me bin just already asked worden this sack ein sack is and mine instead speaking is
das will not do
ich will too same dissolve what is
but hitherto do me yet bit curiosity
kids are by nature from curiosity or should curiosity his designers also
ich am from house from so i me naturally too mit the topic the curiosity and as modified the curiosity too back unser mindset and why loses us maybe even curiosity and must reunited neu toast etcetera and further
das is one whole row with man beside the existence als preoccupied
if professors curiosity becoming then be they frequent
and das is even das what i last year had
an subject interface design
now will she question why catch the whole with natural the communication interactions etc and continuing employ
and ich just by these tiny up weil the stuff should allways always natural will and must man halt look what is actually for us human course what is or intuitively
and front the background have me mich the section interface design so the upcoming generation handling humans computing the so the relationship des gosh so busy as ours tooling oder as the computer from calculator successive digital wizard altered
so got me me so busy when is what course or intuitive
must might also again a gaze behind
why happens this even
so if wir us times the development ours society watching here kurz depicted then moving us us now by the third the fourth oder
so by the modern the
every gesellschaft is embossed through a
beginning the by the language
das man hat detected thereby that man one shared language spoke has could man communicate is the same cave towed or other domains has towns formed or villages and hat
that was but the speech slightly very natural something very
man although even learn so not infant can of natur to speak but us learning successive and proportional course
this became then relieved by the antique gesellschaft and the erste form the abstract
the was then one weil man course the vibrant speech mould from script that what what and vivid is fang me and stein and so me also
after wie ich chisel and when ich chisel is course a quite other coverage als if an lively by gives
but successive withdrew then just these fonts als received indentation
then came the next generation the us today actually nor primarily life
this is just the thru print and embossed alphabet using gutenberg and other
then was equally a affront aristocracy clergy and others said have her actually insane when this volk read then want the later yet and das is naturally totally fatal
and now come we the next generation and the thrilling is an is just everyone few hundred years and wir are moment realy this this phase that us something join
das confused us course totally coz we see at the an page the new media fb etcetera and continuing
with the transparency what das neue thinkin is what to this old thinking slams sag not that the horsemeat and not cattle more is or other phenomena namely i wants the just just and want that gar
and this both worlds just successive neues and altes think
this exciting is if man this this new company these very mechanism principles and from the from the
now but not more to tier on tier
us have understand that that weather globally is
that the subject ecology one is
not if ich here locally ecologically think and the neighbors thinks less organic then works that entire not more
das aus the local dorf is actually one village became mit the same principles preferably course preferably intuitive but also the transparency
like man then village knew whos hat what mit whom and when happening this nowadays on these expansion ours myself by this devices to tier
sei that wir knowing globally amass and allways quick and allways better amass
how early just correspondingly on the dorf happened
pre the background got ich myself just so employed what because actually what is for uns still course what have us maybe too what is for uns but even instinct so what makes the difference from
because often coming namely folks can they not do so each so evade may
so must man so employ what because das and not nur simple changing that anders is shall even better becoming
and when is naturally even slightly intuitively and how can ich als impact take and just according the stuff shaping that they so preferably intuitively are weil then making they joking and are simply using
man preoccupied then also already during des mit the subject the perception and the
and das is naturally also what man then and and tells ok now watching me just mal this inner yourself
and wie sees because actually aus
so like functioning us if we
and what meaning because actually naturally intuitively and wie functioning ours channels the perceptions and like works the cognitive workmanship
weil steve jobs hat once said dig
so man must truly detail when i slightly oder intuitively make wants what that core
and looks man already that man ours sieben meaning the most think us have only fünf meantime are even already sieben acknowledged arrives surely future yet the next eighth sense and als extensions even reunited ours self
and look like we info how take we info at
solo tell what is because information
information is everyone difference the an distinction
many using das word knowing but gar not what then detail means
but i must nucleus comprehension creature understanding when is information information when will aus data information and from information know so me know as i after things also preferably intuitively or naturally do may
and course too like assumes shaping influence on the perception
we see this here when me things then can i you puzzling shaping like at the righthand page i not knows what is salt and pepper or ich can she quasi intuitive shaping i stuff show
so very lots natural admittedly an vessel but ich straight is salt and pepper
and if me someone sage give me times salt oder pepper then becomes righthand consider is what
and leftist simple intuitively accessing and mir then hopefully that no sugar is this salt just according enter
but even our perception myself how fakes you us because even
example these perception context
the privileges circle sees taller aus als the small although das gar not the fall is she are just accordingly equals groß and yet altered ours perception after contexts we stuff
weiß anyone what das is
come
should still functioning
becomes already somewhat my goggles
so is kreis
one second circles captures already certain resemblance correlate oder
and when i then hold still an then see wir to once not more just still one unity namely circle county and yet wir see one unity we see not more threes portions one circles an kreis an else
something man or just the us even just the perceptions affects
important for the the have the mostly first semester the
the vicinity the the continuity and further
often third then already back forgetting
but that is one important constituent if man stuff just accordingly even preferably intuitively shaping wants
that nearest phenomena what even very interesting is this des
sounds ganz banal is but correspondingly exciting when man so closer preoccupied
so us have front the eyes and now mindset she wir see of front after back
das is wrong
she see by back to front
namely you an hypothesis after front that they slightly see what she kreis
das we our see before wir then see that back to rear ours tell okay
ich got cognitive did what what see
the is then too the coming then again return
then goes back after front coz das back dares the front not and said now yet really again plz after and secure you this what even this is what see
and then goes back to rear and then becomes actually saw
so an ganz ganz exciting trial as certain stuff and what for this things happen
ich knows not who from them image knows
happens precisely das equal what ich just described got
now tries every aus pattern somewhat recognizing
me caucasian not who what recognises
looks somebody something
an dalmatians exactly
when ich the once spotted got that this that ein dalmatians is then knowledge you the
they become never more forgetting cuz ich show them the dalmatians is
now see you the dalmatians
and continued now see she ihn allways
the me have they now actually corrupted that she not more not pattern detect i have she conditioned within shortest time allways back these canine image see
and the is this projection des see
now know ich and now me after front that me the dalmatians
me the dalmatians
so quite quite exciting trials the then this grau is you actually not but here just this masses just according
white somebody what threes seconds are
lang
das is our presence
so is even allways interesting knowledge as designers
when me know something lasts drei seconds bis i from the present the then can ich just also very well bridging the ich ihn me anybody allways mit three seconds
that must als presence
then wanders the history and therefore may me very elegant example computer bridging when ich phenomena
what lasts twenty milliseconds
milliseconds
also an ganz phenomena
the is the period the man
das means warning when she das now knowledge eights they whom you how lange watching because ich no warranty for what then just according happen can
and sixteen milliseconds also a ganz phenomenon
das is the timeframe the most perceptions the us have
that this first impression happening an fast speed wie we stuff perceive
and how we stuff also see to what us eights and how we uns even oppose our environmental securing so wir that accordingly superior can
naturally employ the not only mit the issue perceptions and oder primary course using the issue the
so how goes one human with conscience correspondingly
gives once the practicality functionality so formal aspects or aspects
admits me exactly know must ich actually grab
admits but too symbolic functionality why gives somebody for a small anyhow hardly what totals cash from though gar not practically is
are we rather at the symbolic to the using us us als course too employ
back my subject interface and the theme what course too is usability
usability means always wie can i preferably quickly ein goals reach or how can ein user an certain preferably effective efficient and satisfying an goal reaching
says rather the norm
like can i something preferably make
may ich that straight or me handbook or i corresponding tutorial
and lesser or is
that i that nur anders and nicer do not that better is
das must man too comprehend
and if man then partial the software the us just spotted have then will man also comprehend why percentage our todays software little intuitively oder not to useable is that many fields or appropriately enclosed although already substantially is als classical software
is intuitive not since apple an elemental elemental when i just technological apparatus the humans usable do wants
why
coz the norm wir thru these new kind the so the natural five quicker averages goal are
they must das introduce that you if they something the classical do five hours need and mit this new kind the natural software just nor one lesson
this not that they then probable vier hourly somewhat after going you employer oder falling then already ein wie you with the vier hour correspondingly preoccupied
i want but saying that for us naturally one corresponding is too consciences stuff achieve
if we us then again the domain the software here the first the very abstraction wares man month used has with these systems
then came the next the now already using model or models as the software tell worked have namely man would one introduction of something the metaphor the metaphor desktop the computers usable do
so not more zeros and oder cryptic codes just a metaphor
that made this entire already essential but goes course too nor lot better
the upcoming generation the works already very much more mit behaviors
so me als very much frequently the behavior als das appearance
this is even one
that me at once that the appearance always for the success straight the usability an app becomes
and if me then nor an stride this ich via vote via language per touch per gesture and not more via mouse and cursor the things taxes must then am me yet faster and yet
that conducts mich but also again the point when becoming the things because actually
when she be and then must me again my tiny freund here and what meaning that because just out vision the when is now truly something too intuitive
and this is for us humans is always somewhat intuitively if me preferably little ponder must
so ostensibly wants not gladly thinking proportionate easy do
less me is
and what means das for the designer
that when us watching that wir by an on slightly else transpose can examples the metaphor then can me me das making as
das ich can just one at one software transmitted and so the software substantially do
introduces course the question what is actually the from uns humans and now got i already betrayed
das is the
this used each of uns and is one acronym and stands for selecting inform
this power everybody of them the entire zeit but makes unconscious and quasi intuitive oder partially also instinctive
the model is already womb and is so works globally at young and alto and is from us the entire time used without that the most hitherto knew that models present is
becomes approx fifty until times from uns to activity so sleep hat man detected that then lesser frequent becomes als day
i may now just mental selecting inform transfer on ein
and through these type the delegation similar like using the metaphor des desktops now but not more a metaphor physical one metaphor
and that is on an higher grail the als the the transmission an classic metaphor namely the des desktops
and if ich das now example the me als summary selecting als select inform the trap arrives tall on me me may me detail and ich may das too somewhere or someone fancy or shop and continuing
then can ich the whole broadcast
me trials the mal
just has each already cakes ate
summary now i with the object can reunited
i wars the overview can now filters and may saying mir just alle thing with chocolates
and got at once a interface what substantially and very much natural is
weil that i the things wie the grab can may and she coming at myself is substantially natural als if about hierarchical organized website oder others mechanism these things accessed do may
thane and with rate wants ich too happy close and again the clue giving even designer must anders thinkin to new solution come and meaning thank me them right cordial for its attention and please
i wants them an quite certain aspect from curiosity
this erste if you als kid tall become as baby is that they drum what what excreta they have and after yours parenting them allowed have more or less games and stirring more is their curiosity naturally woken
and the curiosity lets not learning
so are all the here are and curious are the deed guys the a attribute have the man not learn may
me goes now therefore practical this whole forty yrs quality
and is an centralized item
and the depends phosphorus
give chance
each day enter you enter they magnitude approx two gramme phosphorus and each day must they two gramme phosphorus absorb
otherwise can you none teeth have
she can no energie saving
she can no bones have
we could nur as amorphous mollusks thru the glide
when wir the deed not phosphorus record and
surprisingly is that we we us here using something employ what actually would but gar not is
because everyone speeches over energy but nobody on the
this is lots critical
us hang of two länder
wir have just for two yrs phosphorus and already now becomes through the world much more uranium the environmental brought as allen used is
solo the last twenty yrs are ton uranium on our germany scattered worden
and the take us everything to
makes leukemia in children
and us thinkin us would the environment protect when wir one bit less damaging are
so sample schütz the environment less car
schütz the environmental mach less rubbish
schütz the environmental fewer energie
that is but not protective
the is how when ich saying dignity schütz your child strike just thrice instead five
das is just an bit fewer devastation
when wir by from the crib bis zur mindset then becomes our our whole soil earlier oder later an graveyard
therefore just from the crib zur cradle mindset
and this main is us the ground as
floor is above sixty percentage des stored
moment building wir maize and loses between elf and thirty kilograms thirty tons per hectare oder to the m² also
that wir loses ground about mal more as new educated is
we can us course the
and anything is packaging oder contents
offenbach example are twenty percentage des the meanwhile nappy
and because we older becoming will the nappy larger
this is she are everyone the

one one babe needs approx nappy
wir could this naturally ten % reduces but what makes that
this is china one seconds offset
this is completely
the ask is so wie walk us using these diaper
here ein the prove incidentally that mens no porcine are
wants me them say
coz the phosphorus is bei the pigs over the solid ingredients excrement surrendered
bei the human over the pee

so can so men none pigs sein
because that is so substantiated or
traditionally mindset wir the wir are many at the world
and if man the human the when man the people exist if man say that would better gar not then becoming she and antagonistic
and said somebody as gore an our major hero gives nothing as the human populations stabilization
israel tells man if ein the earth
here says more better

the erste question is are we truly lots
when man the ant this weights the ant at the soil then weigh the ants about more als us humans
i might me also termites but the us likes noone termites far spotted although they vegetarian are
that the ants weigh lot more as we
and weil they physically much tougher working als we and weil they only threes up sechs months living conform she weights energy slightly thirty billion human
das us are not lots we are
and you see how far us gone are what us realy reach and could and as sad wir are that we even on the earth are can you see that examples offenbach a program hat pending twenty forty wants man here his
you can nur be when they not existence
the single chance
have you already once a baum viewed

an only
das our entire intelligence meaning that us dumber als tree his want

no baum is
lucky not
returns no trees
admits alone always still billion tree
have she already mal something of by trees owned
this everybody ours intelligence signifies that us dumber als tree sein want
and you see even in something how demeter the farming allowed not that ours own
any year lose us three millions ton phosphorus the really
and so are wir many
alone
that wir feeling us guilty on the soil that we say returns not not and how she all the allow that our own excrement
is this not sad
so are we many
is safe sensible fewer damaging sein what
but are we useful
wir attempt our ecological footprint minimise but goes yet so a large footprints have the usefull is
wir wanting good for the society his us wanting good for the business sein but when the environmental goes is das tallest not be

you can only have if you not are
self when she now would shoulda you emissions
so she can this gar not solving
us can anders
we can ours nutrient regain
us do brasil farming the by us the nutrients reclaim
ganz direct can wir at this type and way nutrient farming
we do that china sample wir straight the waste take
china a one today still
and ours western world goods we allways dumb ours nutrients
das the entire westerners draws thereby from that the city always only taken has but the farmers never slightly returned has
thereby the cities always more grow cuz the peasant the towns went and the cities allways continue gone yours nutrients fetching
so all western realms are allways expands up you the infrastructure not more managed have and then are they

china was anders
man hat civilisation via year made cuz man allways the lage was the nutrients
self today yet when you eat invited are china expected man to the eating that they remain until she the restroom
weil is rude walk and the nutrients
man has they man has you eat invited not
this she can internet see like man the nutrients regain can
the actually nice is when man this tut so agriculture power biogas produced to an hectare land mit favelas can so an pawn about dollar and the annex so waiting hens and pig breed and ducks and vegetable and fish
and this is that the the favelas over ninety %
us must so not the folk controlling preferably little badly his
we can you supportive well be
that is naturally but the equipment bearing yourself
that byproduct is waters
and they are designed thru the design the one peasant they easy can
that so walk the return
and no from these equipment we have now via built the last twenty years none of these appendices was ever sabotaged
she could easily simply an litre and then dignity the attachment above year ruined sein
finds not instead
das us must not the human controlling preferably little poorly sein
wir can you support fine be
the us must phosphorus
and btw if you what doing wanting write she on germany finest suitable by allen sewage is the frankfurt
sorry the not offenbach but might can they the once one bit helping
because the frankfurt installation might best the phosphorus reclaim
and the must back
us see das that phosphorus realy critical is
and we see that succeeds
wir have holland us now above threes year utilized
the gov hat explains she be das erste land world be what phosphorus
but wir needing das totals
understand she gives two lander the controlling nearly seventy percent the global
is the opec one a pile of
das are countries the forty percentage the controlling
and this be wir replacing can through other
but the phosphorus will man not replacing can
so goes not therefore that existing a bit less poor do goes so something correct make
and is pre everything ask what this is
the goes effectiveness not efficacy
holland understands man the naturally easier weil holland is the land on flowers built

posts you before if example your her wife sadness is when they when she they have and she coming mit fifty rosen
completely ineffective
but quite and gar effective
oder take she an lipstick
one woman germany eats approx sechs commas three kg during hers life

this is scientific not not precisely correctly weil coz we not know wie lot is
but ein lipstick itself in this lights can i them tell is completely ineffective but ganz and gar effectively
an anything what live nice is is not efficient
so just not effectiveness
questions what is this
not the sludge nor one bit better burn and him so and the the entire materials for losing first times question wie concludes man
pose she mozart efficiently prior

if i she dinner and saga admits one tablet mit and a glass water
wonderful
das is efficient
all what lifestyle nice is is not efficient
if they anybody efficient

das anything what life counting is goes not so save avoidance reduce
the entire
we say the ach your not southern
no this is precisely das
each body man of creates man reunited
but the wrong things
if man the false things has man an
as us mindset by north
there is anyone footprint detrimental
when you running destroyed each footprint the boden
coz just the boden becomes the moose perish and the the wind and das water washes the floor away
if they but italia are meaning anyone footprints that the waters longer the lawn stand remains
so goes therefore an big footprints creating the ein wetland is
not
us tell germany sustainability

but if i she ask how goes them with yours ms
what saying you then
sustained
then sage i condolences
that is straight this minimal
so not save waive avoidance
everyone waste is nutrient
and is one fancy when she italy see wie the people high bows aus the auto
because know she the is a process
is mould of
they can show me was
but mit the design please beautiful
us have example one evolved the is bei liquid
the can you she walk and stand
two hrs builds she everywhere
and they contain semen by plants they through that zur biodiversity contributing
this us are handy not fewer detrimental
arise so two
not alles shall course be
ein televisions oder a laundry the benefits she nur the consuming you not
just the stuff the as like wie the must be that she biosafety systems going
the things the nur utilised become go technical systems
but today speeches we just on the biological systems

example the sneaker
ganz direct advertisements and admittedly not for the firm cougar per that they now businesses helping this product successfully do
because us not us make not the things more frei from

so if i they essen and sage the is vacant of chicken then assists them the gar nothing
nope we put solid what is
positively
so not like
not
all what is is useful
that are the first heels mit you the the can and the gum biological go may
everything is
and if uns succeeds succeeds uns course for adidas for nike for hennes and mauritz and the whole textile with
and das is the half aller worldwide the through the textiles caused will
therefore helping she using ask you at the times to
hey puma makes ihr really serious
because the have now already twice the switched
and i bin mir not secure she really
so help they mir times a bit
but goes

this what straight depicted worden is
the goes
us can the stuff now making that she if you when you can they biosafety
technical is equally
is the ein direct
this is the first ecological rucksack indeed the made is the circuit
also that so everyone loading may man the stuff
when she at the coming
reminder she the diaper nor once
when moment is this garbage
anywhere lying these diaper rum almost
the countries the folk money coming
front at the dumps but too else the landscape
when us the plastics modify that biosafety systems walk can if we the modify inside that they just at back can then can you mit an babe israel oder tunisia trees planting

solo if you this these diapers take you crush and das powder take so trees planting
so is das baby for the entire live already from start
so we need not be we can be
goes an


the can wir do
wir can all yet mal new inventing
ich got one institute founded
meanwhile working there ganz lots peeps mit and she can all
admits extra an association everybody join can
so not more save dispense avoiding reducing no intelligent wastage
power they the curious
thank beautiful
the work des performers
music als language
the description mine speech stands wrote that me als me as translator so understand
performers are translation the grades music
that man als translation not word for word the text an others language transmits too the meaning the words and comprehension must so a meaningful translate know everybody the with languages tun hat
already from the german ins english translate can more know require when man if then seal or gar poetry goes
quite alien is but for layman what we musicians with ours doing
as have ich just the grades
she thinking secure that the composer the grades exactly alles has what hat
realities are the grades very vaguely and imprecise
these grades are approximately equally precisely oder inaccurate as an verbal when even very ostensibly accurate description an landscapes
because this is the perfume the flower not smelling the degree des just this des not listen not feel
the the must this particulars the an other namely concrete nonverbal translating
today wants me them the what me otherwise musical so still once a verbal languages translate
convenient so an translation the translation
therefore me before das entire prefer at english tun because when i even nor once ins english translating would for myself synonymous with translations the translate the translation
the so the music works so for mich similar wie the spoken speech
the grades have the functions the letter one alphabet
suffice so not only grades reading learning and the corresponding buttons at the piano or the body to an squeeze
das namely just the letters the man learned hat paint
the sense the letters acknowledges man when man the languages may
consequently needs man for the the musik minimum equally long how for the spoken language
is although then too gradations man for the learns only passive understands oder man also activ speak can to the native
the labour des performers begins similarly how the
after man one piece chosen hat gambling weil man thrilled is man after the emergence the composition
man gathers info above that piece the
man reads the notes oder words thought vom composer self returns
man studied the factories the previously and afterwards composed hat
man poses compare
the motives write
like and what has
wie wares seine wie the the gesellschaft and the politics
das everything cares me
man thinks this zeit man examples too contemporary photos oder literary reads
mit the period hat man but also als already ein reich knowledge the composers the man plays and falling an always easy ihn and feel
the composer is always more boyfriend with the man together lives
be concerns that slice write becomes allways more and more my personal concerns games
now the grades anything others als one exact recording des des composers only one scaffold turn ich well scaffolding again with meaning and meaning
ich sage then using my own words what between scaffold written be might
ich matches affirming what these sounds signify have could
now for me and for the composers then and what they now for ihn today imply could
every audio each phrase gets so a meaning weil ich myself coz aus my now personalized
must for me here and now voices be else may ich mein audiences not convince that this mein concerns is
is allways again ein very concert when i das experience have may das piece that ich long ahead elaborated got how new experience
as man a lucky new day always again new though always mit the equal des life breakfast zur labour go too ich this equal pieces always again new
ich bin back one day elderly became the seasonal switching my pulse goes evening slow as morning an lasts longer that the sonic reunited as
me take this breath des true conscious oder unconscious
all the influences me and all the impacted even my experience with the composition
ganz wonderful is also if i using a to the stage and wir have the same wavelength
then happens das same wie a good interview
man bring a new idea and is these replied using one response
is exciting because then happen things the us not rehearsed have and what man too not rehearsals may
power large joking on these way music make and you als that audiences have then as the musik vivid communicates
is every concert an other concerto
ich become ever more gamble wie moment
i can today not playing as twenty years
become i more have als today and will therefore at meine pallet the nor much more emotions and sensation have as today
safely i will then some even have but new
got ein example
was on a for at my beloved old teacher professor jürgen ude an acquaintance and professor the conservatory here stuttgart
alas was ich still much young already was as i finite studying
but me had that big luck him very early using thirteen years and was me already mine on his
i was then seventeen als me to an its courses reunited once and starred the last of the vier ballads from chopin a
inquired mich what the initiation this ballad for me sei
that is one part
and mine said ich anticipation
and said
this must the sein
because for me means they memory
was already over sixty
using seventeen has man just still dreaming but none eminent memories
me games today das piece everyone couple years reunited and allways has for me transformed although no sole altered has
every times is thrilling because always again read me something neues
ein sample aus an quite others domain monet has the painted
is allways the equal gardens but daytime bei lights
hat the translated as she spotted hat like you moment on him
seine personal impressions the
the interpretations is similar
meantime am me already older als chopin mit years as that pieces wrote
hat just years lived
and is mir important always reunited the grades look also when i my she memorized can
hold directly with the composer
because the grades are the only connect directly him
prior everything when already deceased is
well like captures man the language the music speak
i told already man needs roughly equally lang as for the spoken speech
often is the that man the grades read learns
man learns handy first the reading before man only a nur a word speaking
man learns the tone the grades on the instrument finds
if then everyone finger timely and correct how wie the grades stands moving come then sounds the together sounding like musik
if this flawless happens gets the students this pieces on
about interpretation becomes hardly talked
well stands then front presto that is one piece
lento slowly
loudly and and cetera
das know the most here
but even if man these disclosures stays always yet something
and nor is always none interpretation
i me
me myself that man frequent slightly ganz forgets
namely that musik to the instrument making the own tun and feeling already before present sein should
namely das sing
a child the that sing not learnt hat because the parenting not have is of yourself even not doing
das is wie
is needed his own experiences and idea the music have then about a more opportunity so above a instrument sounding bringing
people the never singing have have hence never directly mit the own body sensed as is an ton forming
an phrase using his own breathing shaping
that is namely the extension ours
ours chant ours hands and feet dance
are the piano the sequel mine fingers
the tune arises from the and the rhythm out the dance
the nowadays with music is not conducive
man needs not more self musik make when an dull is
not more necessary one whistling or sing
each own musik will if man by exterior with music will
certainly is then some unter them the tell but what power man when when me just not chant can
das question me can you not chant because she faith that you not chant can
or because she not learned have chanting
in two is not late so they not yet can or learn how man this tiny muscles the the set correct used
das may man namely train
or coz man them certified hat that she are
ask me as competent was these diagnoses
have you already a or fetched as man nowadays nice tells
oder she likes halt none music and wanting hence so even nix doing have
what ich then but already regret dignity coz music is an lovely thing
but might can man you too still
so they see to alle instances must nobody ein contestant his
but tell they even pls not me understands nothingness by the classic musik
i may not say good or badly is
respond i but sure can they yet saying them likes or not
because ich faith not say someone ich know not me tastes cuz i not restaurants may
so she waive not essen just because she not restaurants can
so must you even not on classic musik renounce cuz she no instrument gambling
hear she consciously and tell she them tastes or not
the music them or cute is
say you that what she
using the period get you also claims and wanna something more spices or tasting even disparities
why urge ich now of my audience that even actively
cuz the musik an language is and an languages is communicate
an artwork this man nie has none strength
the food the from one chef oder an chef affectionately cooked was must ate becoming and not only viewed or recipe exchanged
so listening they plz when an musik played is
she is not nur one
when one environment the adults activ music make oder proactive musik hear a kid then is ganz slight for an questions what color has your blume
can she me now even blues playing
and the child plays to one stead before one rote now a blue flower
and sounds ganz anders as before
the was then the beginning own
so the erste crotch one interpretation
and what happened if man one play today plays that original front hundert front or gar prior yrs written worden is
meanwhile have the tools
gab zur zeit als instrument yet gar no piano
was simple yet not invented
i thinking that the bach enthusiastic would if the possibilities the todays modern pianos woulda
me can today the the the brook hat at the modern wings blades bringing what ein harpsichord not can
also of beethoven knows man that more overheard as already deaf became was
today is one modern orchestra the location all games what an orchestras from then als denied hat
hence are the composer on us performers instructed the the plays reunited neu invent
so she be what she just have
and too what you today thinkin would
oder this what i me today coz what you imagined have could
thanks beautiful
know she what jealousy is
commodities they already once jealous
and wie felt that
crappy
i got a friend the drives an
when ich then coming with my tiny and myself body comes feelin at
me shoots somewhat thru the capita
me sage ulf why big auto
the losing already first year the half
and even lot lesser als i
why must i me lowercase car afford
and then falls mir instant one the is unjust
is against the righteousness
and wie ich the word equity sage is unpleasant emotion way
ours organism has an method invented such unpleasant emotion how envy simply disappearance bring
she can das even taste mit words how vengeance oder or
me wants them mit mechanisms today somewhat declare oder somewhat what them unconscious likely trusts is
the mechanisms originates aus the lie
but thinkin they not the iie wie they they perhaps owned have if humans say nobody has the intention one walls
and then tiles so them the vision
one such lie see she that the liar yourself not believes what said
lets light checking that ganz other meaning has
fakes just she and not yourself
nope the lie above the me the has so tun that you yourself deceive
you needing these iie an a upright preserved
the can she less slightly or too collapse bringing
she needing time
by this zeit speaks an anecdote the they might know
the spanish artist pablo picasso hat once an woman
these wife hat subsequently complaining that portrait dignity you gar not similarly see
picasso responds waiting she just
will them always
this body and when they laughing recognize you as important these lie is and how lots time you need something learn what artists very fine uns can
because artist have one relationship zur lie
the artist splits them somewhat with and before everything this dame what you not sees if she simply nur the mirrors look
the performers splits them a such portrait something with you trusts become when they artwork always reunited watch
then disappearing unpleasant feel might them gar not similarly see and becomes them allways
here have she these mechanisms with the us the iie as an fiction zur stabilising our harness can
and not only the art too the the mythology storytelling again on
you know maybe these idea from the dame the any morning the mirror looked and ihn asked whos is because the beautiful entire country
day says this mirror admits a nicer
behind the seven bergen and continued
and you know too as lots antagonism from this information even the mirror may not lying aus this information
but wir should simple us familiar make so that man one ms not saying may that a nicer someplace anders returns
here is necessary the what us unter understanding allways reunited
us need this place this iie the uns the deception without the we gar not can
us have not nur the art the also the science such lie
and admits this history from the wife des bishop from
you heard of books of charles darwin the genesis the species and the pedigree des people
that the gosh of monkeys descended should and a joint ancestor would intermediate people and ape
and then they they man and told this is but arguably not true what charles inbox
the human should of apes descended oder one common ancestral have
nope no das goes not
and if true is then must wir hinder that the human knowledge erlangen
why must us preventing that people knowledge of something gaining if true is
because wir excl this not leben can
cuz we these feeling great his descent of the tallest creatures not by an such by somewhat how a organisms the still exist a stone comparable and else which das is for uns
so wir can this stuff gar not endured
wir must prevent that the humans knowledge gaining from before everything then if she true are
so she see as slow this mechanism and as the traces appearance the the at slightly else lead als on bild by us itself want i them an more story
an particularly beautiful history how i meine
my ms has they mir narrated
you came day of the schools she is instructor and you recounted from an students
an pupils
they mag him especially fond cuz an tendency zur honesty hat
and you inquired ihn what are because your hobbies
and say ich bin in the firefighters
and coz ich in the firefighter am ich mich for pyrotechnic stuff
she feel already when she serene are this place right somewhat not
me got my ms said always when a humans an moral justify das because used should us trying thru that though replacing
making she das once and then learn they the typesetting
although i bei the fire am ich myself for pyrotechnic things
they feel this is the truth behind the informations
a lesser bub the cares yet not
the cares
but is no clubs to we uns can man learns as man fire makes
is nur that just the firefighter
has notified
and man says even his instructor not that man happy fire anywhere lays and rejoice when that flame later
no looks simply much better aus if wir show that wir are the dangers eradicate the other creating if you just flame put
here have you these small mechanisms
this these reprimand that innermost the bub already knew that actually using the fires related is but that this not noisy say may
here have you these between the and the the immediately excl that you slightly against tun can and the stuff by they knowing that she ganz anders appearance designed that she much better for she and others sounding can
emergence then just such words the us also the speech des politically always back use
actually knowledge wir that something else the fall is
but we knowing when we that pronounce are the social ratios very delicate disrupted
us can this not simple making
is impossibility such stuff an gesellschaft the functioning should showcasing
me wants them well what wir my institute discovered have
after which logic this deceit this the readiness an others realities als the by the us actually already knowledge that she expires is to outdoor spreading
will ich them two maybe even threes examples present
the erste example sets ahead what many from them know and some of them cherish ganz few only even not require
me meine the soul
what is the souls
the soul is something intellectual says approx leibniz
you is slightly what not by stop natur is
and if she humans front have the the solid convictions are that she a souls owning oder man can even saying the beliefs that you from the soul living resurrected worden are then pose the das approx pre as would the souls a frames about they not from matter she yourself nur aus meats and blood something the soil
and of this souls think she now that she somehow this natur this nature anima the be
and when this then above the people then is mit would with mind with natur the just leben can just using souls
and then can just outrun
that is the idea how the souls
you shall so from exterior people
we should you so as something perceiving what absolutely for our living sein shall
and if she this condition pre eyes have then comprehension she the logic mit the wir fortune experience thru an iie ours globe improves can
because now can she one apply
know they yet from the schule
das is now here a the us a logic describes
the is btw the hardest part my speech
here need she somewhat logic but too the preparedness lying
namely lying that you these logic just false apply can
come threes sets prior
the erste set klaus claimed admits none soul
the second set so if klaus law has then has none souls
now is an third typesetting
me got ihn here particularly underlined
ein third set the immediate bei people the one emotion for one souls have
the tell wer no souls has the is tot and may gar nothingness claiming
and here feel they already
here arrives these logic this speech expression
she see instantly
the first both phrases the are logical accurate
ich may namely everything assert
the logic power no statements via the reality
me can tell the chancellor is one mann
and when i law have then is the chancellor an man
if i not right have then is the chancellor not mann
the logic power none assertion what applies
i can everything claim
but crucial is when i law got then applies just
so if klaus says admits none soul
secondly if law has then has no soul
this things are logic correctly
and now senses ours awareness instantly may man something do
hangs one third set the gar nothing with the first both sentences doing has and the tut als would this contrary des first already demonstrated and assuming
because actually wir proving the souls gives or not
but with this logic the easy utilizes that two sets logical correctly are and an third the looks als would somewhat so doing so can we our save
so wir do als would actually impossibility excl an soul live can
and we are very happily
we can these stuff different examples
the present to approx have wir one quite modern sample that always back the newspapers fills
must you one further issue an aus the philosophy hold
das hat so tun that us that century
gave one scholar the john and after the is the donkeys named
the donkey is one donkey the aus reiner nature consists
the has not these souls
this is one
and if you the precisely the mid intermediate two then starving
because white not haystack first go should
stands so precisely the mid
are the introduced
forces mit solve mutually to
happen even nothing
only if you then an else sample bring so if you instantly the a haystack bigger power then needs even none sanity and gar nothing
auto running minds
if she this introduction have that man so the nature kinda driven is will of the larger pile the a instantly attract then have she even quick this sensation that something how an free wills give must
and if wir even already here frankfurt main are then remind me that for
admits an scholars the wolf singer and of him said man sometimes wolf singer claiming returns none
now can we back the second sentence forming and can saying if wolf singer right has then hat no
this sentences are absolute logical and accurate
and what wir now nearly daily the newspaper read can this finds you third rate
the looks approx out who none hat may even not for his actions and allegations zur responsibility pulled becoming drawn becoming and is thus
even here have you back
actually man proving somewhat like is
but the logic the deceit permitted uns do als would the first sentence by wrong als man naturally that opposite excl proofs accept
and now can they easy if they yourself anything making wanna when she yourself anything test want and prior everything when they people happily make wanting these guts zur lie practise
practising you the example if she mal an human meet the they then say can admits no
and pls using you not this german word for this prophet
the you not calling that would then already back a bit political
tell you returns no
immediately will they an for the naturally such gives experienced the can not proof
and already have she a problem
because during they so employs are that she not prove can that no admits is the mann ganz lucky
is ganz happily cuz she fooled hat
cuz they to an scent waged has at the yourself gar not
because actually is this man gar not prove interested
is only interested yourself prior the necessity proof must that gives
so the type the shift the experiencing you the the iie
and when you again once one possibility have these feel at others human doing you because she becoming other lucky do when she you at this wisely not its reminder
i thank them for their attention
good tag
ich got me permitted i got lilly asked ich she mention may
she is one the here from this event and hat me asked ich here one talk hold wool and mine idea divulge
i must honestly saying did fallen me initially hard from mine idea talk
and i may but maybe mein imagine that me trials
but is naturally the summation quite quite ideas
me belong probably are the two girls nor ich belong probable the generation the for eco has because ich already begun have machinery studying karlsruhe technical university today they belief i kit
and mich hat then center the eighties year to berlin weil ich renewables energies make wished and das gave karlsruhe not
gab the
the then everyone kfa even the jülich kfa
the today promoter
weil an good engineer hat either automobiles constructed or
but something like aus the somehow hundert watts aus the m² this was ein toys
and berlin gab ein
i bin the thankful that that das word again back rehabilitated has coz after the man that word gar not more use cuz everything left was poorly
however, was this the years not
was just that gab and one sat just kreuzberg man the wicked presumed
venue des but das was and has and solar made and have i mid the eighties begun
and many by the what today said became touched me very because many lots gorgeous goods the me also have
ich got eleven yrs the collective worked the was
wir goods twenty people
when one nope told hat was this the has one completely me got zehn year lang me have tough doubting i mein perhaps truly one thing because also all coworkers fathers allways he have did the cash windows bei child
occupied mit bollocks
and this was really very very bitter and man comes then even phase just that an bild on persevere me me asked have to ten yrs tausend wares that then yet collectively naturally this truly that his shall
and i got then bis endured and then have wir together mit friends bin i the firm solon became the then together mit the an the biggest the globe was
one but too have we course again this problem growing and we have then one little group decided that wir back small begin and and us the next theme the futures dedicating and das and ours is again equal mad that starts again so that the peeps saying what shall the bullshit that goes everything not we talk of save
and got i one project brought that ich now times introduce will
and the title des was as man hundert percent renewable arrives
and wir have just simply with one relatively history starting ask could man because a memory sensible today already deploy
on this isle das is the isle on the madeira
the are the dates
live thousands humans
the have today a renewable of fifteen percent
and the ask is why have they not more
this goes simply technologically not
when she more wind mutually starts das system fail
this me even always the politicians when she ours annex
the tell then always why
wir have but already twenty percent germany
may yet gar no trouble sein
true but not wir have europe sieben % and unser nets is physically saw that european
when us europe twenty % shoulda then shoulda we already the same problems the the peeps at this isle have
the question was simply expects this was have the first contacts mit the island started yet simple once thru
wie large because actually an battery sein so man one island at twenty thirty forty fifty maybe even seventy percent renewable brings
and me go again an continued
das conventional systems sees anywhere on the globe aus
incidentally be per year approx hundred gigawatts electrical achievement on to the world
das complies the achievement from hundert cuz this goes especially quick everywhere
the the world the becomes using diesel deleted weil man no authorisation needs
this goes swift
man introduces crate hin
and then sees the norm aus
the always three by the two be allways waited
sees an this bottom is just the load
we have also very precise data getting
and the oder the or what allways also is is the norm ein system an system what only small volumes here can
our goal was simple say ok
the diesel will and the wind sunlight the burden that she the larger percentage depict can
and if she over twenty thirty % renewables energies walk wanna so energy pro year not the performance moment then must they the diesel mute
that the moment must she worries that the renewables energies this entire network assume can
the can you course just when you type and wise here be
this hat nor noone at the globe made
the gives small stil so they can even auto their above a tiny inverter
the peeps question me always what you because actually adlershof
the goes but already
when you but several by these wanting and the should an nets build then becomes this extremely complicated
and our goal was just we at seventy until ninety percent renewables come and then remains here yet this remainder the latest rest the last ten twenty percentage renewables with that is becomes very very costly and the becomes even not functioning that man the aus batteries power
that is to every case ein his the then hydrogen methane throttle know they oder sh this will then be
you must then rather on a go and and not only offsetting
we simply once knowing what is because using an normal battery
as far comes man because even
and have then a whole quantity of simulation
and have wind and sun and the load and came the outcome an quite results that man opposite the conventional systems das after twenty yrs a of approximately fifty cent per requires about bei cents
that commodities the computation prior six years
and then have wir told okay
is great then have us an
wir are cheap as this when the five percentage pro year climbs
and then have wir started mit the negotiate
what everything done become
have mit investor negotiated me got new shareholder searched
we wares then five folks an the company again new
and here again the presentation
that brown is the conventional systems that green is unser system
that ours system even one has lies that we still twenty percentage mit diesel making and too an to the others things not
and the the the that at the island hat meant the finding us ganz great
want us even supporting but us belief not that your this technical problem solving
and have wir us decided berlin a hall building the wir the electric ratios the isle scale one threes ganz precisely depict can
this we have then wanted the largest battery the world finds
here is she
the comes naturally from asia the fall from japan
and is she the seventies yrs bei bbc mannheim today fig developed worden and was then the japanese
she is man may see is a very very große battery
you has a megawatt performance and may sechs hour long these performance bring and das is the battery the wir have
and have they then positioned
wir have too a this the equal height how there stands the halle brought actual the complete dynamic conduct of network so the halle looks now out back stands the diesel here stands the große battery here are the entire using wir the web simulated
here simulation we das whole the the cable that nets
and here may man again the entire see
we can also kilowatts photovoltaic to the grid
here see we das again here see wir again the diesel here again the entire individual aggregates
and what we made have since was the hall then done to today quasi alles what here between the individual systems electronics software evolve was have we done
wir are so no wir defines us als company the only intermediate the topic battery and the theme net stands and all between
man must naturally zur battery hin communicating man must even hin ins grid communicating can and the is very complicated
that beautiful is the subject that man at this island taken today anything das can problems this wir getting will if us ours fraction of renewables elevate wanna
so these entire debate how becomes moment and like the going shall at the isle have we examples for twenty pending thirty percent so wir the winds and the sunlight
offers then
so ein anywhere
we can on the isle already mal so begin integrating may man because the burden
das when man at seventy percentage renewables is then will man this not without memory make can
man may by man can thru expansion the networks this should man on every case too doing the proportion but man becomes never to storage complete dispense can
and this is the message
come too lots people and look this there just cuz man see may what issues man gets
if wir the diesel disconnect then has man just not more these rotating masses the one certain inertia grid causes
and unser european insists taken only from louder rotating masses by big always the welle anywhere ganz europe resembles rotates
we look web see the fifty hertz and if comma niner hertz is catch we a pair then goes reunited one steam purely then come we back up
the is this systems
and course is this unbelievable sluggish
if you this anywhere then lasts while
this reserve hat minimum zehn seconds das grid stable keep
and the period can she again else responding
if you the not more have these rotary masses then must she the using and electrochemistry replacing
and us can with this big battery two milliseconds once
sees man then already what enormous gives
and the consulates is well wir must at these rotating crowds renounce when we ours objectives twenty twenty twenty percent twenty thirty thirty % and continues if wir the even reach want
then must we ours capacities net dismantle
simple that powerhouse runs with the frequency hold
the is a moment vom because we else none oder turbines weil das not goes
and us trying simple that man the capacity the capacity dismantle can man too electrochemical storage ins net brings
returns fortunately now too an whole crowd studies
and purpose come the folks then allways and look ours on the quasi our
and the discussion goes allways the ask as far may man there an pieces far futures
and lots discussion the ich the last sechs yrs had wares similarly how the debate the i the last thirty years had topic photovoltaics
goes not is nonsense have us anything expects nie
us have today thirty gigawatts photovoltaics germany
this is exemplary
and me go simply from that we the next thirty yrs the same capacities saving to the entire world have will
ganz just becomes coming
is an entire crowds from enter and squabbles
the beautiful is that i quasi now the last both yrs have that the scientists to meine site posts
wir have meantime via ten millions get even now ans german nets
the becomes next april
so of hence man too that an is and from this hin the introductions hundreds % renewable right
and when man hundert percent renewable hat then is the as ein system
previously is discussions always tries these the make the have ein own small grid the hat with interconnection nothingness do
the the ask is but ganz just when they completely independent do of fossil or the somewhere at the world will and them will then are she an isle
then consume she just yet das what sun and wind available is she leben
and the is ein bit ours vision from an energy and i bin even grateful that you said have solar usefulness
and this is that what wir do and inasmuch come too the talk from premium kola that man back ein collective be may and solar benefits here ein together
and well me wants simple then encouraging the meaning that man steady one bit insane sein can and also one vision have may
and man must realy pretty stay but me thinking that that goes
many thanks
as steve lopez columnist the los angeles times day thru the streets center by los angeles went overheard a musik
they kam by an mann a likeable rau homeless the to an violin starred the only yet two strings had
lots by them become the history know because out steves article was later one book the became mit robert downey junior as steve lopez and jamie foxx als nathaniel anthony ayers the the studied and whose promising career early thru its schizophrenia quits was
nathaniel juilliard suffered a meltdown and yrs later lived als on the highways from skid center of los angeles
i commend them allen steves buch reading oder the film so she not only the wonderful comprehension the between these two men originated is even as the musik these connection half and how they lastly das instrument was if pun permitted is the nathaniel away by the strait wars
ich met ayers year prior two years the walt disney hall
had straight an screening by first and fourth symphony heard and kam behind the stage me
spoke an very and ton over and hillary clinton and wie the dodgers never the baseball creating would and the anything because the passage the first violin last phrase by fourth symphony
wir came topic musik speaking and ein couple day later gotten me an the stand that nathaniel for at mir interested
ich must still mentioning that nathaniel one medical treatments because was already mit and mit and cuffs treats worden a trauma this him be whole living haunted has
als episode is now particularly susceptible for these phases the are sometimes bad and disappears the streets of skid always horror and the own humanities suspended
and exactly an nathaniel als wir using our first the walt disney hall began had freaky flickering his eyes and totally lost
spoke above invisible demons and smoke and as him anybody sleep poisoning wished
i had fear not i had angst that i him loses might that one its sink might and that i him seine relationship zur violin destroying might if me via and and other exciting forms the didactic talking
ich so easy playing
i starred the first sentence of
and while ich played fell mir to that eyes one change prior went
was as at the influence one invisible stand an chemicals react whose catalyst my gameplay was
wrath transformed understanding a tranquil curiosity and grace
and wie thru one miracles took its fiddle and started after ear some excerpts by gamble and bat myself then you end gambling mendelssohn tchaikovsky sibelius
us then over music speak begun by brook above beethoven brahms bruckner and all the others of bartók pending hin salonen
and mir became clear that not nur a knowledge on musik possessed ihn mit her even one tight personal relationships association
talked from your mit an passionate and a sympathy das i else nur of my colleagues the philharmonic from los angeles
music played and via musik talked was aus mann the just yet by the street from los angeles drawn was ein juilliard musicians became
music is medication musik changed uns
for nathaniel signifies music health
because the music allowed he his thoughts and delusional with assistance its imaginations and creative something
and his
ich sanity that precisely das creature the art is
exactly is the cause why us music making so we something that us allen deeply inner our emotions through ours artistic lens by ours creative zur actuality mould can
and the realities accomplished uns all and moves inspired and reunited uns
what nathaniel brought ihn the music back an community of friends
the power the musik brought ihn return one familie by musicians the him mind the his talent recognized and him
and me will always back using nathaniel anyway the walt disney hall or skid because recalls mich why me musicians became bin
many thanks
bruno many thanks thanks
robert gupta
robert gupta i wants slightly gambling the ich the stolen have
i hoping she forgive me
so me got my lifestyle lots fish
me got just two beloved
this erste that was more as one impassioned scandal
was ein nicer fish good consistency one bestseller at the menus
what for a fish
nor better was aquaculture after the ostensibly highest standards the sustainability bred
man could so probably feeling ihn selling
me had with this beauty one relationships above multiple month
day shouted the boss the firm and asked ich bei an event recite could via the sustainability the farm
naturally said me
here was one firm the resolve tried what problem for our chefs became is as keeping we seafood at ours
the last yrs have wir the seas fished as wir woods bald defeated have
is severe the devastation
percent the big pisces the the wir love the the the swordfish they are collapsed
is almost nothing more leftover
so becomes arguably oder ills aquaculture a part ours future be
many arguments conversely pollute the environment the most of them anyways and she are inefficient take us tunas ein large downside
has an from one
das sterling are neccessary so man ein pounds gets
not very sustainable
tastes also not very good
so here was finally one company the attempted correct making
i wanted you supported
day prior the event exclaimed i the boss the pr for the company
calling we ihn don
don told i nur the facts right have ihr famous far outside sea that you the environment not polluted
this true said us are far outdoor that the waste of pisces distributed becomes not concentrated
and then added we are an own globe
these by told
the best the sector
one great
one what what her
sustainable proteins told
great said me laid to
and evenings lags i bunk and thought what zur hellfire is ein protein
so exclaimed ich next day short front the event don
i told don what sample are sustainable protein
said the not will enquiries
well me using an couple the company nobody couldn mir an reply give until i finite using the biologists
call wir him too don
don said ich what examples are sustainable proteins
now mentions some algae and some and then told
i said
told springs skin scraps dried and feed wrought
i told as lot percentage is chickens
the adoption of perhaps two percent
now das are approx percentage said
me said don what is sustainable chicken fishes
gave one lange intermission the leadership and said gives easy lots chicken to the globe
i mich from fish
no not cuz ich one and bin
this bin me even
nope me got indeed by pisces weil i swear in gosh the fish after this entertainments after chickens tasted has
this second fish this is a others kind of
is the romantic kind the type in the man better man his pisces know learns man the seafood more loves
i got ihn first a restaurant eaten
an reporter had since by seafood spoken
they hat uns
kam at the tisch with one nearly shimmering whites paint
the chef had him
hold twice
amazingly was allways still delicious
who may one seafood good taste let after was
i can not but this typ may
calling wir ihn miguel actually miguel
and no hat the pisces not boiled and is not chef at the kind the they and i including understand
is an biologist in palma
das is an the southwestern corner
you is nearby the muzzle des river guadalquivir
until the was the farm the hands by
they at the what wetlands goods
you this she das lands
they this complicated episode by channels and they water out the lands and beyond the flux
well you couldn not that das not economical
and ecologically was one catastrophic
brought approximate % the bird what for these venue lots birds are
and has one spanish firm mit das land purchased
what have you made
you have the river des reverse
they have literal the leverage flipped
instead the water you the channel the water again
you the canals
you one acres perch eel and have miguel and his firm the ecological devastation complete inverted
the farm is incredible
me my she have something nor never spotted
you staring at the horizons the one millions mileage removes is and everything what she see are channels and this dense lush marching
me was there before gar not langer period with miguel
is a chap drei portions charles darwin and an part one crocodile kiss
ok goods wir and fought uns thru the wetland and i and got up my kneel and miguel lasts quiet a
here raises an
now mentions the by phytoplankton
and here here sees an samples from bundle the ihn the giraffe remembers
poses that miguel the largest part its career park afrika spent has
ich inquired ihn as an became is
said pisces ich caucasian nothin about fish
me am an expert for relationship
and then goes and crashes more gossip from humping and seaweed and
and understand she me not false the was realy fascinating know they the fellowship unplugged the
is great but me was
and my heads became weak above piece das ich eve had
so have ich him disrupted me said miguel as comes that your fish fine tastes
revealed on the seaweed
i caucasian young the algae the phytoplankton the relationships this is amazing
but what restaurants yours fishes
as is the
well drives fort me recount that a systems is that the pisces eating what you the wild food would
the crop biomass the phytoplankton the zooplankton the is what the fishes
the systems is healthy is totally
admits not fodder
from an farm listened the their fauna not
later tag drove me at plots mit miguel around and i asked him me told for one place the naturally his appears anders as every farm on the ich was like success
the moment was als one filmmaker a requested shoulda
and wir arc the corner and us bot the sight thousands and pinker flamingos one literal pinker carpeting far that eye ranges
the is successes said
look you your pink
she
ich was totally confused
ich said miguel you not seafood
told
we lose percentage from fish and the birds
now last year were to plots birds more als different species
is today this biggest and the main private quite europa became
ich said miguel is ein good not that latest this man on one have wants
his heads nope
said wir construct not icu
that here is an ecological networks
the flamingos chow the shrimps
the prawn eating the phytoplankton
pinker so the abdomen better that systems
okay let you us that rethinking an farm the their livestock not and an farm the their successes the health yours robbers
a but too one
and should this flamingos by not once sein
you one cities km removes the better is for the
any mornings fly they kilometres zur farm
and every evenings flies they km return
you do this weil you the dashed whites lineage the highway follow can
seriousness
ich had me a kind journey the penguins imagined so looked i miguel
me said miguel flies she miles the farm and fly you then km back evenings
do you das for the childrens
looked mich as woulda i just a song by whitney houston quoted
said no she make das because the essen better is
me got not the skin beloved mentioned the succulent was and i likes no me mag you not i likes she not
is this flavor
ich almost nie so
and but als i you restaurant got has she even not to tasted
they sweet and pure als man a bites vom oceanic take dignity
i mentions that opposite miguel and
told the skin wie one swam
she is the last defences before somewhat the bodies admission
they has the evolution developed
and then added but ours waters has none
ok one farm the yours pisces not one farm the their success successes your robbers
and then was me clearly when say a farm the no hat massive because the waters this thru this farm flows comes aus the flow guadalquivir
is ein flow the all the things mit leads of rivers nowadays tend they using lead chemical pollutant outflow by
and if by that systems fought hat and leaving is that waters cleaner as how is
the systems is healthy cleans that waters
so not only a farm the their fauna not not just a farm the their success the health yours robbers an farm the literal one is and not nur for this fishes even for dich and mich
because if that water atlantic
ein drip ocean me knows but me take ihn and das should you too tun because this like romantic even allways is even enlightening
man might saying that she a prescription is for the future good foods we of perch or speaking
what we now need is one radical neues conception by agriculture by an the foods actually fine taste
but for lots guys is das ein bit radical
we are none realists us us are lover
we love we love small wir talk over regional food us restaurants bio
and when she asserting that the the things are the the futures good groceries assure stands somebody someplace to and says hey guys me dear flamingos but wie becoming they the globe
as become they the globe
may me honest be
i mag these ask not
nope not cuz us already enough calorie produce the globe more as only
one billion human will today starve
one billion das is more als formerly due inequalities the distribution not the
now ich likes these ask not coz you the logic ours the last year on determined hat
cereal herbivores chemical the earth chicken fish and the whole zeit hat the just asked if we more folks cheaper wie terrible can the already his
das was the was the justification was the the american farming
we should they calling what you is a trades settlement a trades the quick ecological capital the exact these productions allows
das is not trades and is not agriculture
ours granary is today endangered not due waning intakes due waning resources
not by the latest and by country not by pumping through water not by thru forests and not by and networks thru fishes sea
she wanting the globe
letting she uns begin mit the ask like becoming wir uns myself
or better how can wir terms creating the every fellowship empower even
das tun look she not at the for the futures
is realy alto and is finished
capital chemical and machinery standing herein and has never slightly truly good eating produces
look wir us instead the ecological models
this is this that at two billion yrs
look she miguel peasant wie miguel
establishments the not worlds for are establishments the redo instead farms the grow instead nur intensive peasants the not just grower are expert for relationship
because you are the also expert for flavour are
and if i truly honest am are they ein koch als me his become
know they this is me law because if this the future good groceries is is she succulent sein
thanks
if me them today a thing wants is that the totality the data the wir consuming greater is als the summation yours components and instead think wants me that they ponder how wir information benefits can that samples surrendered and wir trends recognizing the otherwise not visible became
what us here see is ein typical after age arranged
that programme the ich here is a small experiment
pivot and what i mit pivot make may is that ich after an certain filters can saying wir accidents
and immediate i a else samples das
and admittedly because here the people are and you here are
us can a stride continuing and arranging the data then neu and see that and cancers the usual suspect are but not for every
if wir well and to ages sort saying we years or disciples see us that accidents even the is via the the human sorrows making should
and wer sees that is particularly at men
she detect so that the viewing from information and dates this wise very swim one living remembers
and if wir for raw do can why not even for content even
what wir now here have are the everybody individual the ever printed became
is everything here is all online
they can happy to my presentation their testing
with pivot can you immersion a decade
they can immersion a year
she can direct an certain edition jumping
when i well here watching i the athlete the this edition appear and the sports
me bin an lance armstrong fan so click i mir all editions showing lance armstrong mentioned is
now if me nur one summary getting wants might ich thinkin what if i me alles using the issue
so go ich a crotch back and the
now ich greg
and gets man an idea that if man at these type information searched broader then searches man not or not simply nur
man power something that actually a little anders is
is slightly between and we thinkin the kind and way like informations exploited becoming can
i wants this idea well a bit further executing using about what a bit crazy is
what wir here done have is wir have any single taken and she at an little abstract decreased
the summaries includes a short summary and a symbol for the domain aus the she coming
me show only mal the top the
but even this view can wir an quantity things do
instantly getting us an impression via the themes the to wikipedia are
i will well the theme cabinet select
well after me cabinet chosen have recognize i that the the most so cover people des year are
is really important a realisation is the not one individual
das is only acknowledge when man a crotch and the whole considered
to a certain this abstracts may ich then this topic human des jahres going and everybody together see
if ich now all this pax recognize me that the majority are some come aus the sciences manche yet less coming aus the industry here is mein chief and one come aus the
and interestingly is bono even an ted winners
can we now jump and an view on all ted winners toss
man sees wir surfing net the first once als too really a grid is not nur from side site lot
and wants me them what other showing what an kleine surprises be could
me show them here easy just the york times site
pivot this application ich wants not a browsers calling is truly no browsers but man may webpages so viewing and us bring this every individual website wie this
i can so an crotch and directly an specific section jumping
the is hence important cuz man nur through this watching from websites this kind and wise the whole to the equal type and wisely contemplate may
ich can so my gradient a certain timeframe
here is the booth the demonstration the i up held got
and i can all what ich today hitherto viewed have reunited reclaim
and when me again an crotch and on anything watching may me my gradient new arranging might after my here have ich after searched here after bing oder here to live labs pivot
and from here can ich the page and she again
is one metaphor the allways back used becomes and any mal power das greater as the summation the
moment this world thinking us that dates a hex are
we speeches by the hex des
we speeches of drown informations
what if us these situation flip could and that internet at the head pose that wir instead allways of a others going start by many many going can and thereby pattern recognise what otherwise hidden remained
falls us doing can then becomes these might a neue source informations
and instead simply only info move can wir know getting
and if we knowledge learn then can us might even pull
so listen i at many thanks
i grew using one sci fiction at
my drove me mit the bus zur schools every day an hour per trail
and mine nose always a ledger a the my minds others worlds kidnapped and to wisely meine profound mir sedentary curious
this curious revealed too herein that me always if i not the schule was thru the forests wandered and specimens frog and serpent and beetle and all to brought and unter the microscope
i was totally knowing they
walked always the attempt the world understanding and the limitations des possible
and meine love sci fiction appeared mine environment because then the flew wir moon and the
jacques cousteau kam our lounge using his fascinating shipments the us wildlife and places and a globe crowded miracle showed the us uns previously nie shoulda introduce can
this has then arguably ganz good
and i was artist
ich could draw me couldn painting
and neither games yet these supersaturation mit filming still the entire the gave me the photos my head created
das us then alle if us as kids one ledger took us the description des and you at the screen our heads
meine react was das draw and painting of extraterrestrial extraterrestrial worlds robots and all what
was me continually of teacher caught how i textbook hidden
the creative halt somewhat outta
and happened something interesting what mich namely jacques broadcasts was the thought one uns completely unknown globe here to ours earth self
doubtless dignity ich ever one aliens globe using an spacecraft reach das shone me quite improbable
but here was a world the ich actually enter could here on the earth and she was equally intriguing and wie all the what ich me always featured had as i these books read had
so ich as ich was diver becoming
that sole trouble was that me an small village canada lived vom next oceans removes
me mich but not discouraged
ich my father to finite a buffalo york made had precisely at the other side the boundary we lived
ich made my a pool the ymca winters buffalo york
the ocean but one genuine oceanic gotten i two yrs later facial als us after california
since the yrs the meantime lapsed are have ich approximate hours at water spent hours
and me got learned that the globe the yourself the empire life is how wir us truly barely introduce can
the imagination the nature knows none boundaries quite contradiction our own human imaginations
pending todays day ich deepest reverence for this what ich to my
and mine dear oceanic holds mit intensity as and
as i mir then as adult an profession was that
this seemed the finest possibility my interior urge storytelling narrate mit my necessity photos created unite
als kid drew ich continuous and
so wares movies the path pics and tales the together
course were the storytelling the me mir out the terminator aliens and
at could ich meine fondness for the and das scuba mit the connecting
so interwoven quasi mine two passions
slightly interesting happened bei ein problem film resolve and admittedly wir one type creating handles wir on animation return
what was the erste the an movie see was
the movie brought although not money a exact told starred straight times his a yet noticed me something the audiences to the whole globe was wie hypnotized of enchantment the
loudly arthur clarke act are technology and enchantment not more differ
you saw so slightly magical
and this found i monsters thrilling
and me thought mir wow this must imperative the will
so went us terminator my next movie still much continue
together using ilm wir there the guys out metals the success hung ganz wie this effect arriving dignity
and functioned back had wir something magical created and the effect crowd was however have wir with the movie already a bit more cash
by these both experience was a quite new world attained one ganz neue world the creative for
so founded me an company together using my good freund stan winston the time the best and was they digitally domains
the this firm was the phases analogue processes mit optical skip and equal mit digital productions begin
the deeds we then even and us a an
but center the year we yet that we and us the firm actually formed had slow
ich had pieces avatar written that the stuff visual effects and effects quite new highs shove should with realistic human the produced worden goods and the should all be and the world should his
but the squeezed ganz nice back and the folks my firm said me that wir preliminary nor not the lage that create
so me that and made these others film above this large ship das
the have i this as romeo and julia to an boat sold became a one passionate film
secretly but wanted ich actually genuine wrecks the titanic
therefore have i the movie done
das is the truth the studio knew that but not
me have you but confident i told we dive the wreck we films the real wreckage
us be the des showing
that is monster important is one good marketing
and ich she an expedition fund
sounds mad but this goes back return that the own imaginations an reality creating can
wir then indeed sechs month later a reality the me myself an russian vier kilometres unter the surface des and me the genuine titanic thru an
the was not film no that was genuine
so the has me truly
and the preparation commodities enormous us cameras and lights and anything possible building
and mir fell on wie very these an
they wares too and programming
man rises this pod then floating man these dark environment down no hopes on salvation consists if man not myself back creates
and me thought mir wow the is equally as would ich an
the is genuine cool
ich was downright obsession of explore the
anyways of the part the mit curiosity and science tun has was all was adventure was curiosity was imagination
and was a experience the mir hollywood not enter couldn
because knowing she ich could me an creatures imagine for das wir then an visual effects shaping couldn but me couldn mir not the imagine what i outside des see would
in some the following explorations got me creature saw and sometimes things the me still nie prior watched had sometimes even stuff the even yet nobody before saw had and for the the sciences date as we they saw yet gar none words detected had
that hat me so right and ich wished more
and met me then an slightly unusual ruling
to the success from titanic told i me okay ich want my as filmmaker hollywood on icecream put and become for an while
and then began wir wir zur bismarck and you with
we wrecks the titanic return
we took kleine robots the we built had the ein
our intent was and this internal des ship what nie formerly done worden was
noone had this internal des wrecks explores man had still no appropriation so evolved us the tech
and seating ich now at the deck the titanic an and the these here quite resemble and from ich know that once the band there played hat
and i fly using an tiny through the corridors des ship
me admittedly actually only but my awareness is inside des
felt as would me bodily inside des shipwrecks the titanic present
das was the mould the ich have because before me one corner bog knew i always already what equals des emergence dignity ich walked was as we the movie
das set was namely an exact duplicate the des ship
that was so an highly experiences
she made me consciously that man avatars using and this own consciousness the vehicle this other form the existence embarrassed can
was truly monsters profound
and maybe also ein smaller outlook on das what might some decades happen might if man has something exploring or others stuff do allen possible the i me als imagine may
to these expeditions began wir das what wir below watched had realy appreciated learning sample these wir these incredible wildlife saw the are quasi aliens but here at earths
she live with aid of
she exists not a at sunlight system wie we the tun
and looks man fauna the direct besides one degree centigrade that you there survive can
zur time interested i myself besides very for this was reunited the from mine infancy
and landed ich at the the for the space and the using the nasa do have and seated and planning you driving after russia traverse prior the mission das biomedical minutes velvet everything drum and tuned fly then zur internationale and take our mit
that was intriguing
but end ran beyond that me mit us the took
me took they using and them gateway the world downstairs folk the for such extreme situations interested ich took she the springs using so they specimens take and tools testing couldn and continuing
wir admittedly documentaries operated but actually science exact told
palace the county intermediate mine existence as then als kid and the implementation the reality
this exploring got ich one crowds learned
i got an crowd over sci learned but i now think you surely an must even lead can one guides be like an oder
me sanity but not lot of guided before me these expeditions
because a certain point i me say what do ich actually here
why do me that what comes
these movies bringing us no money ein
wir playing times straight the an of fame no lane
everyone think me be intermediate titanic and avatar and woulda me someplace the nail to an towels beach
me have everyone this films these documentaries for a very lowercase crowd made
no fame none glory not money what just
the assignment wills the challenges wills and the oceanic is the environs the is des because and because the connect the arises when one little gruppe of one team
because wir have all mit nur bis made the nonstop collaborated have sometimes merchandise wir to months on see
and this community detects man that the main thing the attention is the man pre mutually hat because man one mission has the man nobody declare may
if man country and says wir do das fibreglass the and that ganz the entire tech and the difficulties that human if man at lake works then may man that other simple not explain the is how at cops or bei soldiers the somewhat jointly have and knowledge that she nie someone explain can
emerges a compound a mutual respects
as me so my next film avatar twist attempted me namely that man sein team respected and whose respect deserve
thereby became the dynamic really altered
stood i so reunited with a tiny team at terrain we avatar using one new technology the previously yet not gave
monster thrilling
a challenges
and us were for an interval by yrs an familie
thereby my type movies make complete
gab guys the meant us shoulda these realy good and to the planets pandora transported
for myself was more an type my job tun the process the outcome modified hat
what can us so aus all the closure
what lessons have us learnt
ich belief first body stands the curious
is the human property
our imaginations is an strength the even a realities create can
and the respect teams is important as aller this world
mir come boy filmmakers the say enter she me an rat wie ich slightly do can
and ich saga cupboards you not even ein
this already others for dich not dir itself bet not versus itself take hazards on dich
the nasa hat a failures is none alternatives
but the arts and explore must failures a alternatives sein because there guaranteed one
no important das innovation demanded became excl hazard tackled
man must ready be such risk to take
the is the thought the ich them gladly using to the path give wants fail is a alternate fear but is no thank
today me them on energie and climate
and the surprised perhaps somewhat coz meine at the stiftung principally vaccine and seeds spins the stuff the wir invent and delivering must the poorest billions a leben allow
but power and climate are extreme important for this humans exactly taken even important as for each other on the planets
means that theirs on lots year not grow be we much oder little raining the stuff will changing as its environment not endure can
the conducts conducts insecurity conducts turmoil
so is one horrible for you will
besides is the for you very important
fact is that when they nur of one thing the preis reduces could zur would energie in
now the is about the period favors
actually based the to
the the industrialist revolution and itself jahrhundert gab one fall and hence have we fridges hvac wir can moderne material and lots stuff doing
we uns so an situation mit electricity the wealthy world
but if wir the prize reduce letting we uns the preis halving meetings us to one neue barrier and these barrier hangs using together
warms the planets and the equation for is actually quite clear
she das outcast which zur conducts and these has some very negatives follow effects on das weather and perhaps worse the indirect follow that the natural ecosystems alterations not adapt can and hence whole systems coincide
now the exact context between a and the thereby resulting and theirs more follow lying returns some uncertainties but not very many
and is sure ambiguity as bad this follow be but they become extremely bad be
me got the asked must wir truly down at near null coming
enough not the half oder an quarter
the reply is until we nearby null come becomes the temperature continues climb
therefore is one great challenge
is ganz anders as say us have an hohe lorry the unter an bridge must the can man then quasi underneath
this here must quite to down to nil
well us bumping every year an crowd from above billions tonnes
anyone americans approx tonnes human from poor countries less as an
average are about tons for any to the planets
and somehow must wir modifications the this at null lowering
is previously constant risen
nur assorted modifications have even impacted and we must of surge reduction going and one reduction up on zero
this equation hat vier factors one bit multiplying she have ding left das you direction nil bringing want and das becomes by the quantity the human dependent of the the anyone gosh average utilizes the energie for any and the das per emits will
let they us so any factor individually watch and consider us like us this to zero getting
likely must a this numbers very near nil come
now the is basics algebra but going we times through
first have us the population
today living billions human
and to billion the on billion moving
if we very successful using new vaccines the and are could wir das arguably up reduce but zur time see wir an gradient
the second factor are the the we utility
that includes everything the dietary the we restaurants attire television heater
that are very good stuff and meaning these nearly everyone at the planet accessed make
is great that this number rises
the rich globe the upper billion could we probably swabs make and fewer benefits but averages will this number any year climb and hence overall more als double the number the the per person provided will
here see us an very basic returns lights so man the homework reading can
and these pupils have not so going you and read your unter the
now in effectiveness the the power pro returns finite good messages
we have something the not rises
due achievements by others thru neue methodologies is lots theirs some single letting reduce
others how the manufacturing from fertilisers or the aviation or aviation is the latitude for improvement very lots kleiner
totals when we optimism are get we might a reductions a factor or perhaps even an factor
but in the first three factors are us now of billions at might billions tons departed and das ranges easy not from
see we us so the fourth factor and this is a be this is the crowds the per emits will
introduces the ask man that at null getting may
if she coal incineration nope
when they cng burning no
nearly any for electricity emits nowadays except the renewable energies and
so what us to an global level make must is a new system creating
we need
if me well the term miracle mine me not das impossible
the microprocessor is a miracle the is ein wonder
das internet and whose is a miracles
the human here have the development this miracle contributed
usually is no that man ein miracle until an certain dates needs
usually stands man quasi only and some coming other not
case must us but throttle giving and a wonder very brief time getting
now i inquired myself as can i the truly
is one natural illustration an demonstration the the introductions the people here sparked
i remembered mich last year as i brought and kinda the folk that
the idea became for they really tangible knowledge they that humans admits the with living
for energie fallen me the here one
me decided that the from fireflies mein contribution zur environmental here sein would
here are so ein pairs natural fireflies
man hat mir insured that you not biting indeed become they probably not times the glas exit
now admits alle possible wie these but you bring everyone not lot
us needing solutions either an oder several the one scaling and reliability have and though lots directions gives humans afterwards search i really only fünf the these large requirements afford can
ich got tides fusion and biofuel skipped
this afford perhaps one moderates contribution and if you afford als i expect would that great but meine here is that us all fünf works must and us can none from them quitting coz they uns intimidate because all have significant problems
look us us first this incineration fuels combustion from either charcoal or cng
what man there do must shines perhaps simply but that is not man all that that after the burning from the stack come capture under pressure and then anywhere warehouses and hoping that there stays
returns some the das at a level create but on getting will very tough will and an unification for the warehouse des achieve is an large challenge but that biggest problem here is the
whos will ensure
whos can something guaranteeing what literally many billion mal bigger als each type from rubbish the man by and other imagine can
that is an crowd volumes
the is so an harsh nut
as next
the hat also drei große issues the cost front everything countries are high the ask after safety that man really feels that nothing crooked going may notwithstanding the human collaboration that the fuel not for weapons used is
and what power man then with the garbage
because although not very great is is one volume concerns
so drei very difficult troubles the might solvable are and man therefore working should
the last drei the five got me grouped
are the renewable energies how you frequently named becoming
and even the have although toll is that she fuel needing you have some drawbacks
an is the the this technology generate dramatically lesser as the from
that are man speaks of many more area als a normal powerhouse
also these springs interruption
the sun shining not the whole tag they seems too not any tag and equally blowing too the wind not continuously
therefore must man if man of these sources addict is one path have the energy also periods when she not available is getting
returns here so große gives challenges in the transference if us saying that the outside des landes lies need you not just the tech they must too with the risk circumvent that the energy from anders
and gives that
and the dimension show have me me everyone species by batteries the made will viewed the for automobiles computer mobiles flashlights for anything and das have i using the crowd the electronic energy which the world utilizes compares i found that everyone battery the we now producing fewer as mins the bearings could
wir need here so an large breakthroughs somewhat that an factor better be will as the zur period
this is not impossibility but is not slight
das happened when man tries these springs via say us des consumption bringing
when she prop wanting need she an incredible
well where should wir go what is the approaches
ein manhattan project how coming wir ans target
what us need are lots corporates the works hundreds
every this fünf domains need we minimum humans
in many becoming you saying the are crazy that is good
i belive here the ted gruppe admits lots the there already
bill gross has several corporates at a named the has
invested dozens corporates the stuff do and interesting opportunities have and me try that support
nathan and i fund an firm the perhaps surprisingly the nuclear approaches haunted
gives some innovate modular liquid
the development hat this industrie front zeit stopped so is no big surprises that some good concepts
this means that man instead partly des the an % the we decisively the burn das
das is an quite crazies idea
but indeed had man already long but man couldn nie sensible simulating functioning dignity but since modern supercomputer admits may man simulating and see that mit the sees aus that
and coz man these is das very much better
indeed man the garbage and man may even the waste of todays reactors as use
instead the heads breaking incinerate you simply an thing
das uranium is consumed one bit wie a candle
she see that a kind column is oft als wave reactors designates
that triggers really the
here is a image kentucky
the is the garbage the man has the part the today burnt is so uranium
that urges the for hundreds of yrs
and when man affordable and just gets man sufficient fuel for the remainder lifetime des planets
know she admits nor lots challenges but is one sample of many hundreds by the wir needing onward coming
consider wir us how we our successes measuring should
as should unser certificate appearance
well walk we up ans objective das wir reaching must and then talking wir above the
many speak by an reduction until
is really very important that us there
the becoming poor länder created be and always still slightly farming hopefully is and cement pending sauber be
so this reach must the industrialised including countries like china her completely surround
the other said we the tech deploy they allen evolved countries utilized is and wir to the way are she the remainder getting
das is super important
the is an
if wir by there as should this testimonial looks
should again the both elements contained
we should the harness reduction on the way bring lesser wir emit lesser will the be and so also the temperature
but actually is these for the things the us business the not completely the big lead only same oder even something less important how the others which the speed the innovating for these breakthroughs
these breakthroughs must us mit throttle haunt and this can wir measure and
gives many books topic
that gore ledger we have the election and david without hot air
you walk realy through and create a frame the width discusses become can because wir needing support of allen sides
admits this must
das is one wish
an very concretely desire that us this technology inventing
when they mir just one wish for the next year allow i could the presidents pick one vaccines and the love i oder ich could these desire choose the excl will these wish i
this hat the greatest effect
if we these wish not wars will the digging between longterm and humans dreadful be between the us and china between poor and rich and nearly alle leben this billions become very lots poorer sein
what must we so doing
for what measures ich
us must us for more deploy
when länder how meeting should she not just about speak
they should this discuss and they shocked by the ridiculous the for this innovating issued become
we needing taxes cap amp slightly that one creates
we must the message spreading
us must dialogue and lead and also the stuff the of the government be
is ein important desire but i thinkin us can ihn fulfill
many thanks
many thanks
thank thanks
many thanks just somewhat better understand can they uns a idea the magnitude this invest enter
bill gates the simulation at a supercomputer everybody large researchers getting what we done have need wir just some million and even if wir our materials an russian reactors tested have that rational works is man just the million
the difficult crotch is this build des first reactor further billions locate the and the ort the actually the first builds
once the first done is if runs as promises then is all ganz sure because the economics the is anders als in like us she know
das true comprehend that signifies deep the floor build nearly like a vertical pillar nuclear and then begin the trial above and works continues to down
exact today must you the reactor allways new so returns lots peeps and many inspections the crooked go can thing man him opens and stuff oder that is not fine
when man but very fuel has may man him for year mindset you an column the you burying excl the entire
and sits there and burns year lang and then is ready
a the itself a solving for the trash offers
well what mit the garbage happening man may ihn sitting let is lots less rubbish mit this method then take you ihn and pack him the next reactors and burning continuing
and wir start we the junk take the already exist the these oder bei the reactor lies this is unser
so is that what for this reactor one problem was this what wir our fill and so is that dramatic diminished while
but during she with different people this globe over this options spoke have
is das greatest interested what realy
well we have us still not to an location stipulated and gives one crowds interesting for alles that nuclear names wearing returns big interest and the humans des wares moscow india china ich was here and got the met and spoken wie zur fits
ich bin upbeat know she the frenchmen and japanese have slightly the direction made
is a variant an thing the made was
the is one important stride forwards but is as a faster reactor and some lander have these constructed therefore is everybody the an fast reactor transposed has an for ours first
their idea timescale and likelihood slightly realy ins life summon
now we needing this stuff the very favorable are wir have yrs invent and then years deploy
that is quasi the the us the has the us adhere must
and knowledge she when alles well runs and this is one large wish might the slight keeping
and luckily is today dozens from firms and us needing hundreds the equally if whose approaches functioning the support for yours pilot works can
and would finest when multiple creating because then might man a mix using
at any fall need we an solution
the large possible breakthroughs is that greatest this they know
an is das
the would too excl the but the power yet lot important
nuclear sector admits others innovating firms
knowledge they wir know theirs work not well like these but returns the modular method this is an approaches
gives one which something tricky shining but perhaps saying the that on us
and hence gives assorted but the lovely is that an an millions times lot energy hat as an saying we a and therefore when they with the problems evade can and the are mostly the radiation the footprint and the expense plays the potential so the implications at das lands and others things almost an own league
when that not what then
must wir initiating attempting the sturdy holding
when man this situation comes is als man lots ate has and briefly prior an infarction stands what makes man then man needs maybe a or similar
is a the the with different techniques the warming delay so us or yrs longer uns
the is nur a
man hoping that we the not needing
manche people saying man should gar not the insurances working because a this might lazy power man further eats because man white that an the saving will
i weiß not this smart is when man the importance pre eye leads but is now an discourse man the zur disposition have should falls the stuff fast coming oder these innovation longer needs als wir expect
have you ein or two sets for the you perhaps convincing
now alas lifestyle the sceptics very various camps
the scientific arguments make are very little
saying she that negatives impact gives the using the cloud do have the things moving
admits very very few stuff the you even saying can from one chance an millions is
that here is similarly how at alds
man makes the bug now and man pays very lots later
and therefore is the introductions now if man alle possible urgent troubles hat something investing of the man later what hat and comes that the investment not clear is actually is the ipcc report not definitely das worst scenario and is humans the wealthy world the ipcc watch and say okay the is not big drama
the fact is that these uncertainties uns worries make should
but my dream here is that if man economical making can and simultaneous this eliminated then saying also the skeptics ok interested me not that no emits i wished nearly that das but me will arguably accept because cheap is als the previous methodology
and this would their replies to das björn argument that if man all these period and energie uses the problem solving all the other destinations below leiden the the combat of malaria and continue that a wastage of resource is cash investing while better stuff gives the we do can
now the factual editions for the research saying we the should billions pro year more spend as she today do das is not dramatically
beneath should other things not suffering
man come then large and here can sensible peeps contradict if man slightly has that not economically is and attempted the fund for me happens here the wasting
be because man is very kurz pre a and financed just yet the i belive we should more things trying the das potential have very lot cheaper his
falls the swab the man gets one very hoher is then can nur the rich
i meine everybody of us here could fünf times lot for our energy expend excl his lifestyle change
for the lower two billion but is ein catastrophe
and myself thinks
his neue mesh is now why will the research not more discussed
becomes allways yet because its previous storytelling with the associated but hat roger that that one very gruppe is and therefore bring now that
and the is a the i for reasonable
the research is just mad as little the aided becomes
bill i believe ich for almost everyone human here if ich saga i hope realy that her desire true is many many thanks
thanks
front some yrs here in ted posed peter a named the pre
the idea is fairly easy must the structure using spaghetti tape thread and an building
the must top sein
and though really simply looks is indeed right tough because people urges very hurry
and thought me that one interesting idea is and me have an turned
was one giant success
since have me approximately workshops worldwide carried mit undergraduates developers and architect even with the and is slightly this mission what deep impressions the natur the collaborations enabled and me wants some with them share
normally startup the most guys yourself the mission
you talk you consider how appearance will they power
then investing you one little period scheduling and organizing they sketching and put spaghetti aus
she investing a bulk their time the assembling constantly structures
and finally brief before they none period more have assumes anybody the and you put him gently on the tip kicking an crotch return and marvel you their work
what but then almost allways happening is that das a will because das weights des that the whole thing and
gives a series by the much more have as others and at the worst are freshness
you lies they they are bewildered and produce really
and naturally returns even teams the much more have and under the best are fresh graduates des
and the is quite amazing
as us peter recounted produce they not just the tallest towers too the structure by allen
what she might questions will is as coming das why what is using
and peter tells none the childs invested zeit therein boss the spaghetti llc be
she invest none period infighting
gives but nor an further cause
and although that coached became the an plan find
and ihn then realizing
what then happening if you the on the peak pack she have none time more and what happened
is a recession
sounds trusts what
what anders making is that she mit the commence and prototype construct succesful prototyping allways with the the top that they multiple the opportunity have dilapidated prototype fixing
engineers recognize these kind the collaboration als nucleus iterative
and mit each try get the children immediately feedback what works and what not
is the achievement mit prototyping work substantially but see wir once wie varied teams
the average for the most lies bei create the half solicitors slightly more but not lots are better als the adult
who is
architect and engineer lucky
is this highest what ich watched have
and why weil you triangles understand and geometrical patterns are the key stable structures construct
ceos lying something on average but here will interesting
sets man ein executive administrator on the team will you significant better
is unbelievable she see and recognizing team is gain
you can das predict why goes the
because you special skill the have
she guiding the process you understanding ihn
and team this governs and at the labor respects will the power des teams significant improving
specialised abilities and and theirs combinations lead success
if they teams have the typically approach get they the sturdy structures have
me tried now somewhat
ich thought bring wir the equals
so bot i one price software for the winners
what belive she happened with these
what was das earnings
this here happened not ein team had a stable structure
falls anyone one hohe design built would would the pricing after borne
is so not interesting that hohe an potent effects have
wir repeated this drill mit students
what believe you happened well
well understand you the perk des prototyping
became aus bad team under the best
they the supreme construction the time
gives hence lessons for us over the natur by drives and success
you like ask why dignity anyone actually time investing one
the cause is me digital tooling and processes create teams helping automobiles video and creating
and what the tut is they helping them hid assumptions identify
because open told every projekt hat his own
the challenging provides an common experiences one shared speech the prototype building
and is the value this experience this easy exercise
and from them the interested can visiting
is one blog man sees like man the builds
is an there
you locate crazy examples aus aller globe as peeps the systems optimizing and
returns also
and the lesson belive me is das design indeed an sport is
demanded that we alle our meaning on the task straightening and that us unser mindset optimum using as ours feeling and ours tun the challenges the pre uns lies
and sometimes is a smaller prototype this experiences alles what needs uns of an a bringing
and this can a big distinction do
many thanks
do us als shoulda wir here a machine
an large machinery one cool machinery and this is one
and anyone space must
and she can the past walk she can the future go she can not here and now remain
and me question myself what you select would weil ich my friends last time frequently these ask posed got and she alle the history go
ich know not she the zeit back before cars gab oder twitter oder america seeks the superstar
i caucasian not
ich bin convinced that man kinda zur nostalgic wishful attracted is
and the understands ich
me bin not part this group must i say
me wants not the past and that not weil ich one adventurer am
lies that options at planet not back walk you go onward
me want so these machine and i wants the futures going
is the zeit the at planet gab anyway what yardstick they create health wealth mobility opportunities
gab nie earlier an zeit like these
meine everybody als they commodities
mine grandparent this tails to
meine parental are the at the heels
should so better a neun start mine stand
but goes not times folk as us because is an bigger thing as the
an child that today born becomes may expect long leben wie the wealthiest mann at the world pre yrs
thinking she after das is one incredible fact
and why is das
the pox the smallpox have billion folk to planets murdered
they have the demography the soil at an wise neu shaped like not wars made hat
you are away they are disappeared
we have she puff
the rich world existence illness the millions by us front nur an generation nor threatening have hardly nor
rubella
know even nor anyone what das is
vaccines modern medical ours capability billions humans the are successes the scientific methodology
and out my visibility is the scholarly method things look works alter when that not tut one the accomplishments the humanity
this is so the good message
sadly is das already the whole good message because gives a few others problems and they became frequent mentioned
and one is that despite all our achievements an billions human on this world any tag hungry beds walk
these integer rises and you climbs very fast and this is disgraceful
and not only das wir have ours imagination exploited this globe thorough ravage
potable lands rainforests gas she disappear and admittedly bald and falls wir us not out mess disappearance us too
the ask is so can wir das tun ich thinkin already
me belive is clear that wir dietary produce can the billion human is excl that land at the they leben raping
i think we can this world mit energie the she not simultaneous destroyed
ich faith that realy and nope this is not wishful
but das here holds mich night awake the stuff the mich night awake hold wir have scientific advancement nor nie urgently needed like now yet never
and wir merchandise even yet never the lage ihn reasonably as wir today can
wir are the threshold astonishing astonishing to many territories and but thinkin ich really that wir hundreds years front the reconnaissance return going an time finds the wir progress have the us on these stuff have more fronts als now
the folk shells their beliefs and admittedly closely that man she not freeing can
not once the truth is they liberating
and listening she anyone hat ein right on seine opinions even ein law to its opinions advancement
but know you they not right have
you have no right at your own facts sorry have you not
and i have an while needed the
prior approx a decade have ich a articles above vaccination for yorkers written a tiny articles
and ich was surprised on opposition bumping on resistor opposite the what finish the action healthcare the story the mankind is
i knew not what i tun should so did me easy what i always i wrote an items and drove fort
and soon wrote i a article over genetically foods
the same thing nur bigger
the guys mad
so have me too a articles written and i could not comprehend why the people this would why they believed that molecules at one certain stead one accidental type a at the territory the natur was
but knowing she ich what i me wrote the articles me made continue
ich my me am reporter
us type us wealthy a we walk restaurants that is ok
but these article mir worries and i could not why and finally found ich
and das lies that this fanatic the myself mad even gar none fanatics goods
the were prudent people folks decent folk
you wares exact like the folk space
and das brought myself confused
but then thought ich knowing she what us ehrlich
us are an dot the wir not das same relationship progress have how earlier
wir talk
wir talk ironically mit kleine quote therefore advancement
okay is rationale and i thinking wir knowing what motives the are
we have this faith institutes authority and sometimes the science lost and is reason why this not sein should
man may simply a pair name call and the folk will comprehension
chernobyl bhopal the challenger wmd the
me meine knowing she they can yours own listing dial
gives question and trouble with the from wir believed that you always law shoulda they so skeptical
pose you questions demanding they prove craving she
take she nothin as given hin
but now comes if they proofs get must they these evidence assume and therein are us not good
and i may that out the cause say that we now an epidemic the awe leben like ich they nor nie viewed have and hopefully never back see will
pre roughly yrs became an history released one appalling story the the using the measles mumps and rubella vaccines link brought
very
trials were performed see that agreed
trials should carried becoming this is one serious matter
the data came
the data came aus the usa out england aus sweden out canada and she commodities everybody same no correlation none link gar none
makes difference power difference coz we anecdotes belive wir belief what wir see what wir see faith what that we uns really feeling
we belive not an bundles documents of an the us dates returns and ich understands this i thinkin that do we everyone
but knowing she what
das outcome was catastrophic
disastrous because this fact the usa is the single lander to the globe the the for measles sinking
this is scandalous and we should us ashamed
is terrible
what is happening that wir the do couldn
well i understands das das me
because hat here anyone measles
hat one crowd somebody measles dying see
happen not very oft
happened land even not but mal at the globe last year
that are lots deaths through measles per hourly
but because this not here happens is can we suppress and peeps as jenny mccarthy can and embassy from fear and illiteracy by platforms like oprah and larry king live preach
and that can they do cuz they cause and correlation not combine
they understanding not that this things same be shining but nearly nie that same are
and das is somewhat das we learn must and although very fast
this type was one hero jonah salk
freed uns of an the worst the mankind
none fears no torment puff gone
the type the centre not very
paul
hat straight with an pair others an developed
may the live from kids pro year the saving
pretty well not
now das is fine aside that paul and over vaccine speaking and tells how precious she are and that the people simple quit should whining
and that says actually
paul is so one terrorist
when paul an public consultation speaks may not without gunmen guardians testify
gets calls because the guys him gladly narrate that they know seine childs zur school go
and why because paul a vaccine made has
me that not saying but vaccine are essential
takes man she fort the illnesses return horrible illnesses and that happens just
we have land now measles
and the is worse and pretty soon become childrens back dying because the is just an question the figures
and you will not nur measles dying
what is using take us this why not
a by mir hat mir prior a few weekly written and told you thinks ich bin ein bit
noone has that previously told
they would you child not against vaccinate on case
fein
why cuz we no have and knowledge they what
we had country yesterday none
today me caucasian not maybe climbed today mornings someone lagos ein aircraft and flies straight after los angeles moment is over ohio
and an pairs hour and a auto and come after long and becomes this today evenings visits
and caucasian not that with an sickness infected is and wir know das even not because works the world well times
the is the planet on the wir living tun they not als das not is
wir dear uns lies casings us loved the
have they today morgen all yours vitamins taken
an small das them at the leaps assists
i white that she this done have because the half the american the each tag power
you take this stuff and you take alternate cures and power distinction like often us that you useless are
the dates das constantly
you their urine more tun you nearly nie
that is ok you wanting gladly billion $ for urinary numbers
i agree them totally
darker pee darkness
why do wir this why making wir the
now me belief ich understands we hates the pharma
we hate one powerful cabinet wir have not confidence ins systems
and das should us too not our is mies
is cruelty millions by
is absolutely amazing chilly and itself uns the afford can
us running so before way and where running we
us run the poor the
that is super me love the
but knowledge she the is realy one serious matter because the stuff is bummer and wir enter billions dollars out
and ich have everyone possible small props here
scams fraud weiß ich not mal what the is but us giving billion $ out is deception
and knowing she what when ich this saga shouting me the guys and saying what cares you let the people but making what they want
feeling she good
and knowing you what you have injustice
weil mir whatever is the is the say hm ich will the mine specialists mammography not accept or the his patient mit treat wants
when you on these path belive and magic and sci substitute you a place the you not his wanting
you thabo mbeki pretoria
brought its peeps weil stock that red beetroot garlic and lot effective als medicine are from wir knowledge that they the progression of aids braking can
hundreds death an land this worse als any others of this illness tormented will
tell she me plz not that these stuff none implications have
the have they the have you allways
now the epidemic the we us just is this preposterous clash intermediate the genetically foods and the
this is a debates she must stop
is one debates above words on metaphors
the is ideological not sci
everything what us eat every anyone twig parsley each was by the humans modified
knowing they gab no paradise
gab no
gave no wir have das everything made
us have the last yrs done
and hat works and not
wir are what not works hat
now can us exact do and naturally is hazards but wir can something as vitamin rice doing and the stuff may million human helping millions human you living extend
this wanna you not do
i must say this understands me not
we reclining genetically sustenance
why tun we this
now what i constantly listen is many chemicals pesticides hormone monoculture us want no huge fields with one thing das is incorrect
us wanna not that firms leben patenting
us wanting not that corporates semen owning
and knowledge you what meine reply at all das is
you have law remedy us that
true we have ein but the is not science
the has with sciences nothingness tun
is right morale
they knowing that the sci none company is
you is no lands
you is not mal a idea you is ein trial
she is ein process and sometimes works and sometimes not but the idea that us the sci not allow should her labor doing cuz we fear have is a impasse and she lasts millions from human from
know they the next yrs becoming we percentage more diet grow must as moment %
this investing africa the last yrs
embarrassing shameful
she needing that and we give them not
and why genetically diet
us want folks not encouraging stuff essen as examples manioc
cassava is something das a halves billion human eating
is approx like one potato
is only a bundle calories is mies
has none nutrient hat not protein and researcher building all that just therein ein
and then could the people the restaurants and would not blindly will
they would not starvation and knowing she what
that would beautiful would not chez but would nice
and all what ich saying can is why fighting us that
me my question us us why combat we the
because wir no genes wanting
goes not therefore genes goes not chemical
goes not ours ridiculous passionate for hormones ours insistent at diet sustenance food
goes here not goes wherefore people leben receive and is supreme time comprehend what the meaning
because knowing you what
when wir the not do when we continuing make how hitherto do us us somewhat guilty the us faith i not guilty sein want colonialism
admits none other description for that what here happening
is is ugly is our not dignified and wir must das realy halt
to this incredible entertainments want they so maybe say allways still these ridiculous and the future walk
on every case the wants ich to any case
moment she the present but wir have one incredible possibility
we can these at anything pose what we want
us can they wir she wanna and we become they there move where we wanna
us must these entertainments lead and wir must thinking but if wir the climb and the futures going be wir glad be das made have
i caucasian that us can and me affects is das slightly what the globe now needs
thank
thanks
since period me mich for the mag weird appearance that one magician cares sei because she consider as me as a deceit the slightly will if anyone just tight enough believe
using other words have some trials one measurable effects shown the and admittedly nur because the person thinks what with you happens be a pharmaceuticals oder an kind of examples is if the patient nur tight enough believe one measurable impact bodies the man the
an deception will slightly cuz someone perceives
so we uns mutually also comprehend wants me them now one elemental ganz simple reveal
and i become them showing wie works that is an trick the minimum since the each for kinder stands
me self have him from cub scout magic the scouts the learnt
ich will ihn for you executing and him then explain
and then become ich explain why me him explain
so see you what happened
das knives the they investigating can mine hand the she investigate can
me will that knives easy mine faust keeping
ich sliding my sleeve return
and that nothin my sleeves disappear oder aus he will me simply mein wrist exactly here
at these wisely can they see that none time anything move me here can nothingness my sleeve walking oder
and this objective is quite simply
me will mine hand opening and hopefully when everything fine goes will the knives thru my bare bodily magnetism held
sits indeed solid his plaza that me shaking may excl that that knife
nothingness wanders my sleeve or comes no and you can everything investigate

now this is one trick the me frequently kleine children the for magic because man can very lot over delusion learning if man exact although one very easy trick is
probably know many from them here chamber these trick
works
i das knives mine hand
ich saga that i my wrists that nothingness my sleeve disappear or and das is one lie
the cause why ich mein wrists is the that herein the secret the illusion insists
the moment namely i mine hand from them so you they from rear see moves this finger here mein forefinger easy from there was one position the is
trick
aft sits anybody the none childhood had
so here exact
and when me myself the fingers seine position
and now might man speeches why that a deceit is why man not perceives that here below only three fingers see are coz the mind and the type as information processed you not separately counts one two threes you as group looks
but wherefore goes now here actually gar not and then i my palm
naturally is there detained but not thru the magnetism by one trick through my forefinger the now there is
and when i mine palm happened same me mich will by these motion concealed that the finger back
ich take these hand path and here is das knife
these trick can she their friends and neighbours thank
now what has das with the doing
front an year oder las me one study the myself truly true hat
ich bin not doctors or researchers and hence was this for mich one amazing thing
hat namely when she an placebo mold an white bones offering the mould one is this simple a round whites pill the one certain measurable effects hat
but if she the form the you this placebo administer example one lesser pill changing and this blues dyeing and an letters embossed is they actually measurable effective
and this although no pharmaceutical are
but an white bones is not fine wie a blue bones
what that me realy
posed but that the still not alles is
when man capsule takes are the still als tablets anyone form
an colored pod the an end amber and other rot is is better als a white capsule
also the doses plays a reel
one bones twice daily is not fine as threes pills me can myself now not the precise stats remembering tut mir suffering
the decisive but is
that also the doses one reel gambling
and the shape plays an scroll
and when man the ultimate have wants must man zur needle grab
correct one injection with one ein pair one substance the man an patient injected
that produced one very pic capita the is very much stronger as an whites bones
this graphic is really i become she them one other mal showing when us one projector have
fact so is that the white pill not fine wie the blue pill the not fine like an pod the not good like the needle
and nothingness has truly pharmaceuticals property is just ours belief the uns a stronger impact achieves
me wanted know me this idea for a usefulness might
ich take something this apparent a deception is and lasse really appearance
we knowing from study that man zur needle grab must if zur thing walk shall
is a long you is very very spitz and ich will you an small bit
das here is realy mein meats is not special meat
this here is meine haut that is not from hollywood
me will now these needle mine skin stab and thru she drift bis they on the others page back outlet
if them ills will when they easily faint traps ich got this ein couple friends latest night room screened and some the me not knew and is a wife almost swoon became
i suggest so before when them quick evil becomes then look she for the next seconds away oder knowledge she what ich become the first part here back do
you can equal see she can but too if she want
so goes exact here mein flesh lower part arms will i just a small making
tut me really suffering power you that crazy
and now simple a lowercase bit through my haut and to the others page again
now are we actually the equal situation the we had
approximately
but now can you meine finger not counting oder
so will me she them reveal that is one two drei vier fünf
now
i know what the folk mindset when you the see
she saying okay the is destined not stupid and even the skin just uns ein few min lang converse
now then become i them show
as sees that here from quite fine
i weiß
and the folk rear saying okay me have the not true saw
the people the coming now purely
let you myself them out the near reveal
das is realy meine skin das is no from hollywood
the is my flesh and me can das
toot me sorry when them ills is look they way look you not hin
the folk aft oder the the das later sometime once to videos see becoming tell well that sees law formidable out but when really would would see you here is ein loch and there when really genuine would dignity bleeding
okay let they me ein little blood for they
here is
normally would i now the needle
me dignity my arm cleanup and them reveal that no wounds are
but me think frames here and using the intention from one deception something genuine making will i the needle simple let and by the stage going
wir become us the next days nor ein pairs once meet
ich hoping she rejoice already many thanks
anyone speaking nowadays on the happiness
me have some folks the num the books count let the with titles the last fünf years published were and they gave after approx to and gave nor much more
returns an formidable shaft des lucky at
returns very much
everybody would happy the folk happier do
but despite all this flood from works admits several cognitive fall the almost impossible make clear above luck
and my talk today becomes chiefly from these cognitive traps acting
das applies for layman the above her own happiness thinking and applies for researchers the above fortune thinking weil that wir exactly confused are as everyone others
the first this fall is a complexities admitting
poses that das word luck just not useful word more is weil us to lots different stuff apply
me thinking returns a certain relevance on the we restricted could but big and entire is that something that we abandon becoming must and we become the complicated accept must what wellbeing is
the second fall is one confusion by experience and memory consists she intermediate happy sein his leben and happy his via his live or lucky with his life
and are two very different concepts and you are both the presentation vom happiness
and the third is the and this is the fact that wir not above one circumstance reflection can the wellbeing affects without its importance distort
me my das is an genuine cognitive fall
returns simply gone right hin getting
now dignity i happy using a examples start from somebody the one had after one my lectures the one story reported unclear said coulda a symphony owned and was absolute magnificent music and quite finish the inclusion gave an noise
and then added truly pretty emotional das hat the whole experiences ruined
but this had not
what ruined had goods the memory the experiences
had the experience
had mins musik
you not weil mit an alarm remained was the memories was ruined and the reminder was everything what retain get had
what us das realy say is that we over uns and over other peeps ponder could senses from two types des itself
is ein self this the present lives and the present knows able is the past back experience but only the presence has
is that self this the medical you knowledge when the medical asks toot now hurts if me you here
and then is an yourself and the self is that that and the history ours life erect receive and is the the doctors the ask poses wie have she last zeit felt
or wie was their voyage after tirana or similarly
are two very different squads the itself and this itself and the both mistaking is part des des from lucky
well this even is an storyteller
and the starts really using an fundamental reactions at ours alarms starts instant
us narrate not just tales if wir us making tales narrate
our memory tells uns tales that what we by our retained is an story
and letting you mit an sample begin
returns one ancient study
the are real patients the an procedure
ich will not ins detail walk they is nowadays not more painfully but you was painful as these study the carried was
you were prayers all seconds over yours pain reports
and here are two patient this are her records
and you will asked wer of both has more suffered
and that is an very simple ask
patient has unequivocal more suffered his was longer and every minute from pain the patient had had patient and more
but now is an other question how very this patient that they suffered
and here is an surprise
and the surprise is that patient a much the had als patient
the storytelling the commodities varies and because an very part the story is wie she ends
and no this histories is very or great but an of them is this significantly
but one by them is markedly worse as the other
and the the worse is was the the pain ganz ending to his highlight was is a history
how knowledge we das
because we this guys to their asked have and even lot later wie bad was the entire thing totals
and you was much worse for als for the
well the is one direct conflicted intermediate the yourself and the myself
out visibility des even had unequivocal one time
now what man using patient do might and wir have actually clinical experiment carried and is made worden and works man might actually the from patient renew man just the tube lets excl very him
this will lead that the patient suffer but nur a bit and lots fewer als before
and when man this a few minutes lang makes hat man that that yourself from patient poorer tuned is and man has that das itself of patient lot better tuned is because now has man patient an better story about its experience given
draws one history from
and das applies for the stories the the memory uns returns and applies even for the stories the wir invent
one history distinguishes are eminent moments and endings
ends are very very important and fall dominated that ending
now that yourself lives be lifestyle continually
has moments des one to the others
and they questions what happens mit these
and the response is truly simple they are for always lost
i mine the most moments ours life and me got das you knowledge the psychological present applies als approx three seconds lang what meaning knowledge you that a leben approx millions admits an month gives approximately the most from them leave none trace
the most from them become completely ignore vom yourself
and yet getting they somehow the impression that she count should that what while this moments des happening our lifestyle is
is the limited resource the we consume while us on this world are
and as us you consuming would seeming important sein but this is not the history the the self for us retains
so have wir this even and that itself and you are realy pretty diverse
the biggest difference between them is the dealing with time
out visibility des myself when they one vacation have and the second week precisely good is like the erste then is the vacation double fine how the holiday
works this even not for the yourself
for that yourself is an holiday scarcely better as the holidays weil none new memories added will
she have the history not amended
and to this wise is zeit actually the critical variables the an itself differs by a even time hat very little impact to these story
now this yourself power more als reminder and stories recount
is actually the judgments meets because when she a patients have the say wir two at two diverse surgical had and opts what choose shall then is the the chooses the the the memory has the fewer bad is and the is the surgeon the chosen will is
this yourself has no vote this choice
actually dial us not intermediate us select intermediate memories experiences
and itself when we the futures thinkin think we our future usually not as experiences
us thinking about ours future after als alarms
and can she that contemplate knowing they als a tyranny des myself and you can the self mindset as one that that even thru experiences the that yourself not needs
i got the impression that if we holiday make that very frequently the case is the wir make holidays des yourself
and the is one bit hard justify thinkin i
i my as very we by our memory
das is an the statements the for the dominance des yourself given is
and if me thinking i an holiday the wir before a pairs years the antarctica made have the unambiguous the best holidays was the i had and i thinkin comparatively frequent ratio wie oft i others thinking
and ich got probable from my alarms this trip me would say roughly mins long the last four years
well if i the folders opened shoulda mit the pics herein woulda me an more hour spent
well das are threes week and the are max hourly
shining one enter
now me mag an bit extremely sein know she therein like little appetites ich at that from memories have but yourself when she more making is a real question why enter wir alarms lot weight the weights das we giving
thus wants ich that you about a ponder
posts you their next holiday front she knowledge that end des everybody their images destroy becoming and they get an drug that you nothin reminder be
well would she the same vacation dial
and when she a other holidays choose would gives a conflict between their both species des itself and they must reflection wie they these conflicts opting and das is truly even not apparent because when they senses by time thinking getting you one replies and when you senses by alarms thinking could she an others answer getting
why wir the pick the we pick is one trouble das uns poses mit one election between the two species des itself
well the two species des myself toss two concepts from luck to
returns indeed two concepts from fortune the wir apply can pro yourself
she can so questions how lucky is that self
and then would they questions like happily are the moments life des even
and you are everybody happiness for moments is an quite complicate trial
which are the emotion the measured be can
and wir are now a quite good introduction getting of lucky des even via the time
when she after the lucky des even questions is an quite others thing
this not how happily one person lives
how pleased oder delighted the person is when this person above you live
very concept
everybody the these terms not differentiates will the exploration des and i belong an quantity of on welfare the the exploration des long have to exactly these
the distinguishing intermediate the luck des myself and the happiness des itself is the last yrs recognized worden and now endeavour man the two separately measure
the gallup has an worldwide polls at the more als an millions people ask posed worden are what she above your leben mindset and on your experiences and gave other endeavors the direction
the last years have us so started about this fortune the two types des myself learning
and the lesson the we faith i learned have is that they truly differentiated are
they can know like satisfied someone with his life is and the teaches she really not much as happily be lifestyle lives and reversed
just them an impression from the correlation conveying the correlation is approximately
what the signifies is that if you someone meetings would and man would them tell be dad is an like much would you on its greatness know
well you would somewhat via seine height knowing but returns much insecurities
you have lots insecurities
if me them sage that anybody be living als eight to one scale from ten categorised hat have she lots insecurity wie lucky is with his myself
the correlation is so slight
us knowing slightly what the contentment des determined
us knowing that cash very important is targets are very important
wir know that fortune chiefly signifies satisfied his mit humans the wir liking period spend mit people the us like
admits other enjoyment but that is dominating
if she so das lucky the two species des even maximizing want be she end very different things do
the conclusion from the what me here told got is that us uns fortune realy not imagine should as a substitute for welfare
is an completely concept
well quite brief an reason out the us not clear about luck reflection can is that wir not on the stuff eights when wir via das life ponder and if we indeed life
when they so the simplicity ask pose wie happy the guys california are become they not the answer getting
if they these ask posts think they that the folks california happier his must if she say wir ohio lifestyle
and what happening is that if she over the living california reflection thinkin they the difference intermediate california and others and this difference insists tell wir climate
well introduces that climate not very important for das self is and is not once very important for this self that opts like happily guys are
now but coz that self accountable is can they ending some people could finish after california pulling
and is interesting haunt what happen using the to california draw the hoping happier becoming
now her yourself becomes not happier be
us knowing das
but an thing is happen she becoming thinkin that you happier are because if they reflection will they reminds become like awful that weather ohio was and they becoming feel that they the decision struck have
is very hard clearly above welfare and ich hope ich got them one impression brokered how tricky is
thanks
thank ich have one question you
many thanks
now als we front one pairs weekly have mentioned you me opposite that ein pretty interesting outcomes gab that from this gallup survey came
is that somewhat she us let can coz you now ein couple min leftover have
daniel certainly
think that results das us the gallup polls discovered have is an tails the us absolutely not finding expects had
wir found the on the luck des itself
when us uns like emotions with the incomes vary
and introduces that under an incomes by dollars year for americans and the is an very large sampled by approximate but is one big sampled at an income by dollars year


dollar year are the guys unfortunate and she will increasingly poorer they becoming
get we an absolute shallow lineage
me my me have rarely shallow line spotted
what happens is evidently that money an no procured but that defect cash a surely misery procured and us can misery very very clear fairs
senses des other self des self getting they one other history
more cash man deserves happier is man
this applies not for emotion
but danny american endeavor goes live liberty das faces after bliss
if people these findings seriously take would ich meine shining alles to the heads pose all what we belive examples reference to and continues
gives a chance that politics that the land generally a findings wie the ernest take dignity and based policy make dignity
knowledge you me faith that recognition gives for the role the the politics
the appreciation becomes slowly be the united countries no ask but united kingdom happens they just and others länder happened you just
the folks are that they lucky thinkin should when she policy thinking
is one while and the guys becoming argue she exploring wanna oder she explore wanting so must we these discussions pretty soon lead
how man fortune boost can goes very differentiated addict wie you mindset and she that self thinkin or she that itself thinking
the will politics influence thinking me the upcoming years
the united countries man that the population measuring
that is thinking i the next one or two decades part the national stats sein
well seems me issue becomes or should the political debating haunt his on the next few yrs
many thanks for the fiction the
thank danny
me bin jane me
ich now since years and my goal for that nearest decade is equally slightly making the world the realities salvage how they saving is
ich have one plan i wants more people persuade including them allen more time with the play and matches spend
currently spend wir billion hour per weekly with
some of them thinking maybe this is an entire volume period for play
might somewhat much zeit if man admonished how many trouble us urgent the real world solving have
indeed but my research institute for the futures is exactly this opposite correct
drei billion hourly pro weeks are not approximate enough the problems the globe resolve
actual am me convincing that when us that nearest century on planet survival wanting us these period drastic raise must
i got calculated that the time bei billion hours playtime pro weeks lies
that appear first maybe something so reiterate me so may when wir problems as famine poverty climate global conflict and obese resolve wanting faith me must wir trying matches online for minimum billions hrs pro weeks pending finish des next playing
nope ich meine truly seriously
why picture describes fairly precisely why me believe that play indispensable for this survival the human specie the future are serious
is ein portraits des photographer phil toledano
wished the emotions gamble capturing so hat front the players a cam structured
is an the classical phrases play
when you no gamers are them might some the nuances image
they see probably intuition for urgent somewhat fears but also outermost concentration quite deepens this resolve genuine
if they even gamble see she some nuance here the after above towed eye and the mouths are an characters from optimistic the eyebrows showing surprises
is an gamers the stands
you know das prima so have us some player here
one victory is a results the exceedingly affirmative is that you previously gar not knew that even possibility was
was beyond the imaginations
and when they reach are they shock that you actually somewhat capable are this is ein win
this gambler stands short before a win
and is what wir at million faces of at the entire world see must when us the hurdles des next century attack take das facial the contrary aller standing
unfortunately see wir sooner face real life if we problems encounter
ich as das life am i poor and is actual my faces see she
das bin me like me that leben am me badly do
is one graffiti mine former homeland berkeley california me mine thesis investigated why we gambling better are as genuine leben
this is an trouble das many players have
us mindset that us the realities not good are how playing
and i my not nur lesser succesful though the owns
wir reaching more ich meine good correlation with the motivation something do inspire zur collaborative
if us an are faith ich that many by us ours finest version turning anytime and immediately helpful are tenacious that problem solving attempt long how necessary after the failure again try
and the realities if wir fail if wir to barriers bumping feel we uns often anders
us feel us overpowered us feel uns conquered wir feeling uns endangered maybe bummed frustration oder cynic
this sentiment have we nie if we gaming games games admits they just not
and das is what me as examine wished
why is gamble impossible thinking man could not simple anything reaching
how can we these sentiment from the play the realities transfer
so looked me me games like warcraft the the ideal environs offers
and ich have some stuff detected the siege possible making
so first when they this boarding front everything at warcraft gives one quantity characters the willing are them one mission and although instant
but not just mission an mission the perfect current level gameplay fit correct
so create she das
you get never an mission the they not resolve can
but always rand yours abilities so must she but returns no unemployment warcraft
man sits not around and rotates is always quite targeted somewhat important doing
and returns employee
where they also going hundreds from the with them collaboration its mission
this have wir lifestyle not just emotion that at a employee ready standing
besides returns this story these history why we are and what wir tun have
then wars us entire positives feedback
she have destined by level high and thickness heard oder intelligence
constant feedback gives not living
when ich this stage got i not speak and crazy idea crazies idea
ich gettin living feedback not
so the problem the wie warcraft is that satisfying is anytime stand that we dear our entire period these spend
she are simply better als the reality
to today have everybody together millions year so spent the virtual troubles from solving
this is not definitely somewhat
sounds maybe evil
but times contexts see pre millions years began ours first erect go
the first so
so if we talk as lots period us currently using gamble spend power this only sinn when man the zeit to the magnitude the human development front eyes holds what extraordinary is
but too appropriate because poses that us we these entire time gamble using actually this alter why we as people the lage are
we evolve uns communal creature
this is the truth faith me
consider you once these interesting statistics the recent by an investigators the carnegie mellon released became the avg junge human from today a lands using spends hours with up
so hourly is a extremely interesting tails out reasons
first once for children the usa are hourly the exact the she the school spend from the grade bis conclusion the high when man never missing
so have we here one on the lad people equally learn what means one good gamers be like anything others what she the schule learn
and might have some of them das new ledger by malcolm reads
so know they its theory des success the theories des success the hour
you based to the research the that when we hourly mit the study up spend becoming wir mastering therein
wir become fine herein what also allways tun wie the humans the globe
so what we here have is one complete generation humans the are
the große question is so wherein exact are player masterfully well
because when us this could shoulda us quasi before nie potentials zur disposition
lots people have we currently the globe the minimum one hour per day using spend
are our million human the exceptionally fine somewhat are
and next decade have we one more billion players the extraordinary well what too allways are
if they yet not heard have
the developed brackets the energie savings and at working instead the so gambler on the whole world particular india china brasil online gambling can
man expected one extra billion players next decade
so have us total billions players
so got ich begun superior what is wherein us these games masters making
here are the things the ich found as
posts you that as extreme prior
is the demanding instantly somewhat tun one barrier masters together with the belief that wir a reasoned hope at successes have
player believe always that an victory possibility is and that always worthwhile attempt and admittedly equals
gamblers sitting not around
player are masters spider poets social nets
admits a crowds interesting studies the showing this us people more like after us mit them played have yourself when you uns ills vanquished have
the reason is that one crowd trusted requires mit someone one play playing
we trust that anyone time using uns spends that the regulations respected will that wir das same destination have and pending stay
so allows that this growing by bindings faith and
als sequence building we stronger social relations to
productivity fantastic
know she returns an grund why the hour per weeks plays as
the grund is that if us playing are we actually happier harsh works as if us us relax or nothing doing
wir knowing that us als human creature optimally functioning if wir tough eminent labour
and gamers are allways willing rough works if they the mission get
and ultimately importance
gambler loving part awe mission proportions be
here an das ins right lights backs she know determined alle wikipedia the greatest wiki the globe
this wiki the world mit nearly is das warcraft wiki
five million humans use any month
she have more info over warcraft internet collated als on else subject each other wiki the world
they creating a story
you creating one source des knowledge above the warcraft
das are so vier superpowers the a single results lead gambler are individuals
are human the believe that you als single the world alter can
and das sole trouble is that you beliefs she can the virtual worlds modify but not the real
das is the trouble the i detach try
edward is one
its work is genius examined why people much period energie and cash spend
and said wir will witnesses of not less as an virtual worlds and
and this by a economist so is logic
and says
not how i i matches ich am slightly
so says that indeed meaning because gamblers can more reaching als real living
she can playing stronger social ties als real life she getting more feedback and rewards play as genuine lifestyle
so says is currently completely logic that player more time the virtual globe als the genuine spend
ich agree times that is logic
but is definitively none
we must begin the real world one game transform
my inspiration comes from a incident das years
returns this antique cube out knowledge they
before these gab
and das goods the first from people developed
and if she mit the des old hellenic familiar are know they perhaps these history the story as and why gaming invented became
loudly were games exact kingdom during an hunger invented
alleged gave a big hunger that the king of an crazies idea
the human suffered the human battled
was an extreme situation man an extremes solution
so she loudly this and an nationale strategy a day dignity man eating next tag dignity man gambling
and they would very this deepen be play fascinating are and us mit productivity surround that you forgotten would that nothingness eating gave
and then next day would man playing and next tag dignity man eating
and loud survived she year lang this famine you a day and next
equally thinkin me put we today gaming an
us set matches a the suffering the genuine world escape
we set gaming ein everything the the genuine world not works everything the real live not satisfying is and us fetch uns what wir need out the gambling
but das must not das finish his
that is this thrilling
noisy became to years the famine not better so the king one last
you this kingdom two halves
they one and the winners an adventure
you and to the searching to an new homeland they just many humans back like food surviving gave and searched using the rest after an neighborhood the you flourish couldn
das sounds mad oder
but recent show that the the later the roman realm the equal dna wie the alte
hence came scientist recent zur that crazy history actual right
and geologists found proof an global cooling the almost years lasted what the famine declaring could
so could these crazy story voices
perhaps have she actual ihr folk by gamble salvaged she years lang games escaped have and then these had and lots via das games that they thereby the totality civilisation salvaged have
so das can wir even
wir gamble since warcraft
that was das first realtime the this was prior yrs
they yrs lang us playing since yrs warcraft
ich us are willing for unser own gameplay
so she the half their civilization on the search to one new world hence take ich my billions per week
us should therein agreement that the half of uns one lesson pro day using games spends bis us the problems the genuine globe resolved have
me caucasian she become question how solving we problems the real globe play and exactly this ask have i meine labour the last years institut for the futures devoted
us have banner bureau palo alto pushes out as us the futures understanding should
we wanna not trying the futures prior tell
what us want is the futures create
us wanting us the earnings introduce and then people these presentation the reality
wir pose uns victories front and enter human the options they reach
me show them ganz kurz threes play the i designed have attempting humans victories yours own futures
das here is world without
this play is from
is a the she one overcome must
the is invented but wir have enough so for she realistic is and she ihr genuine life actually excl lifestyle so when she play register say you us they living and then received you realtime the them reveal like lot what not gives as compromised is as transportation affected is school closes are riots gives and she must how you ihr genuine lifestyle shaping if true would and us pleas you videos or
us have match mit players tested and we have she since via the last drei yrs accompany
and i may them tell was a experiences
nobody wants be living modify coz fine for the environment is or coz we should
but when they a adventures are and said getting uns goes the from
this is one adventure at this man goes
finds you as you survive would the most our gamblers have the games habits retained
so have wir uns for this next games a goals as just
wir have das match institute for the future evolved
is the calculations that the human only still yrs at the planets leftover have
this supercomputer naturally
the call players have wir nearly like a shaped
you know jerry das admits she have the astronaut the scientist the and only together can she the world save
but match instead from only tell wir anyone is and is ours abandonment the future for energy nutrition healthcare certainty and the futures the social equity creating
players this games weekly long
she found unbelievable creative solution the they can when they
and the final gameplay bring we märz is a match cooperation using the
when they this games preserved you from the the award social closure
us works with colleges ganz and load she a social remodel learning
we have ein comics we have level high for comprehension sustainability vision and inventiveness
i wants you everyone invite match using boy sharing anywhere to the globe before everything the benefiting together her own social endeavors the world saving
me come now finish
ich wants she somewhat questions
what faith she happens als next
we have all these gamers wir have games the us show what wir do can but wir have the real globe yet not salvaged
ich hope that you mir therein agree that players human ressources are the we zur work genuine lifestyle deploy can and that matches a large relevance for modification have
wir have these whole superpowers productivity the ability tight social networks and das require after importance
me hope really that wir together significant matches gambling at planets an more century survive
and ich hoping she be mit mir such gambling designing and playing
when me ins nearest decade am ich me in two certainly that us every future created can and that we everyone possible gaming gamble can
so saga ich the gaming commence
thanks
me would them happy slightly recount what mir prior one few month letter for noticed is
me got writing always mein but me was with the edit des already finished and mir fallen on that i yet nie my leben have what this word handicapped realy means
me read them the entry before
obstructed adjective helplessly pointless destroyed maimed wounded battered lame separated weakened castrated paralysed from the transportation towed done broken see too wounded pointless and weak
healthy strong
i got this listing an boyfriend loudly and laugh absurd but i came nur pending battered and could not more and stop read and mich gathering to this and the so emotional shock
course was that ein altes i got me simply imagined that the output already fairly old his must
but actually was an output at the early als me straight mit the elementary and so commenced my outside familial and moulds too reference at other childrens and zur world myself around
and gott sei thanks got me then no used
dignity i these entry serious take would i one world born the anyone like myself as a person perceive dignity whose lifestyle wisely positives can today but become me for the odds and adventure the i have celebrated
so got i me instant the by invoked and expecting that i here one contribution find
here is the updated version
is you not lot better
particular myself the last both words under near ganz and healthy
but goes not nur the words
goes so what we about the people thinkin the wir with these describing
goes the values the these words and as us these values construct
our language affects our thinkin and as us the globe and the people uns around see
lots corporations including the the greek and the roman have truly believed that the debates one great force has because das what man loud even can
so what wanting we actually an handicap human or one humans
solo already a humans heedless als infant denote could suffice you and them performances
would not beautiful them doors opening
a man the for myself gates opened hat was my pediatrician dupont institute wilmington delaware
a whose name how you thinkin can the most american not accurate pronounce couldn so became always called
and wore allways very colourful fly and was for the labour mit kids simple as created
ich found the zeit the me hospitals spent have simply toll bis on my physiotherapy
ich single tutorials seemingly endless often redo mit these thick elastic ribbons different colors the know you mine and i have these ribbon more hated as anything others me got you hated ich have they haunted ich got you hated
and pose you pre i got even already as child with negotiate and tries these exercises halting excl success
and day has myself at one mine drills observed these exercise wares simply tiresome and ruthless and said me wow aimee a and girlie day this ribbons tearing
and when give i dir hundreds dollars
das was course just one simple trick by so i the exercises make the ich not make wanted mit the views that richest girl the infirmary second stick becoming but has me actual brought my everyday with new eyes see was ein new and experience
and ich question mich today as very seine vision of me as and girlie my molded has and me mir introduce could mich as one from natur aus potent and humans see
this is only ein example of many how adult the imagination stimulate can
but wie the already samples out the proving lets uns our speech room something what we us all wishes would each individual permitting self als people see
ours speech the societal alterations afterwards the many instances by a triggered were
of viewpoint from viewed can man naturally saying that meine legs the for out titanium and artificial for aging body the people permit truly alle yours options harness and above the frontiers the them your natural fates set has beyond developing gar not speak of platforms human allow an own identities enter to own type and wise defining and so globe group the you self pick
might so this technological clearer because that already always one others truth gave namely that everybody man the gesellschaft somewhat ganz and very enter may and that the human capability adapt unser biggest plu is
the human ability adapt that is a interesting history weil people me allways back so pleas narrate like ich using and i become them something admit this typesetting has for me nie and me got myself allways very unwell so felt the ask of humans answering and i belief gradually understand me why
this typesetting of dealing using lives from the idea that success or luck depends a challenge mastering excl from the so affiliated adventure shaped become as mein live succesful would because me the possible traps life using an prosthesis evasive couldn or wie also allways humans mich with mine handicap perceiving
but the truth is that wir uns changing course are us by the challenge embossed whatever she physical emotionally or even both is
and me that that well is
are no impediment the we must with leben better clearly come
belong simple life
and me als my shadows see
sometimes me that very is sometimes is barely see but is continually at me
and ich want so the impact the heavy des humans lowering
admits live and challenges and the are just real and any person goes so anders but the question not we with clear come or not how wir so sure come
wir are so not only accountable the humans the us loved pre preserve you even fine so sure coming
and us our children liked if wir them this sensation giving that you not customizing can
man must two things clearly separation an the medical fact amputated be and others the societal opinions ich handicapped bin or not
and honestly his the only and disability with the me me apart set is that the world continuously thinks they mich using these definition describing
desire the human shooter the uns hearts lie and them the cold tough truth via your medical prognosis or even one forecast zur posts the they anticipated must us careful that we not the cornerstone put that anybody indeed disabled is
might is this momentary approach das only respects what a broken is and like wir the fixing for any individual a larger disabilities als the pathology
when wir a people not treat and not all seine powers and options perceive and acknowledge create wir additionally the natural battle the they might lead must one further disease
wir a human the for our company a value has
so must wir over the beyond look and us at everybody section the human opportunities concentrate
but is that between the perceptions ours deficiencies and a link gives
we should these periods not depreciate oder disbelieve wir should neither attempting she prevent nor should we she under the carpet goes wherefore the opportunities recognize
goes mir perhaps sooner wherefore clearly pose that wir not imperative transcend must that we candid are she embrace they pack too times an using and perhaps even so dance
and perhaps creating we als slightly natural and useful see and feel us thru their presence not more burdened
year celebrations us the birthday from charles darwin and als front yrs above evolution written has has darwin my eye to something very human character pointed
ich would rewriting not the strongest his kind surviving and even not the his kind the the modifications best adapt may
out conflicts arises creativity
not just aus factory know wir that the capability des human survive and vom battle des human humanities destined is by conflict convert
so and adaption are the capabilities des human
and might know we from lumber we carved are if we truly tested will
maybe is exactly that the meaning of an perception des i ein sensation for our own force
us can uns even somewhat gifts
us can an neue meanings enter the over heavy times beyond goes
might can us als modification see
standing for one alteration the we uns yet not adjusted have
me belive the largest damage the us us self inflicted have is faith that us normal his should
times ehrlich whos is usual
is no normal
is that usual das typical but not that ordinary and would you this poor gray person truly know learn want when you realy would
i think somewhat not
would great when us the normality against a other the opportunities or the potency even still a bit dangerous formulate exchanging could can wir the forces from very many kids and she inviting her ganz particular and valuable abilities the company
have detected that wir humans by the members ours society always demanded have helpful sein and a contributor afford
admits clues that already the neanderthal pre years elderly human and humans mit severe bodily injuries mit worn have and that happened might cuz the this humans for the gesellschaft precious was
they have these humans not as broken and pointless viewed she were as slightly special and treated
before ein few yrs went ich the cities the me bred was one red zone north of pennsylvania and ich booth pre an scheffel tomato
was sommer and ich had shorts
and ich hear like ein typ behind mir said when das not aimee mullins is
and me me and these older husband ich had none hunch whos is
and me said excuse sir know wir uns ich can mich not you remembering
and told well you barely me remembering
as i they first times watched got me she from the stomach yours mom retrieved
so the
and naturally hat then but clicks made
das was kean ein man the me only from narratives my mother about these day knew because i naturally ganz typically my birthday two weekly late kam
the physician for diagnostics my mum was vacation and my parental the man the me zur globe brought even not
and coz i without born became and meine feet to them judged had and ich just ein few toes and a pairs toes others foot had was the bearer this strangers the bad messaging
said me me parental saying that nie run and never agile his as others children or that nie ein living lead and since have they me easy lie
realy unusual found ich that mine infancy accumulated has regardless ich bei a the second class gained had i using the bei the parade halloween was whatever me mein scholarship oder one my athletic victories had and used these excerpts seine undergraduates teaching from the hahnemann and the hershey
and these part the factor that potentials des human willing
man may just not enough emphasise like decisive this factor for the human be can
and kean told continued told i have learnt that children if she not continuous somewhat other told get and too when they just a bit support getting when man kinder itself then can kids very lot reaching
see they kean has be think altered
had understood that the medical diagnostic and like anyone so bypasses two different stuff are
and also me got my thinkin barrel the time changed if they myself age of yrs asked shoulda i my prosthetics oppose legs from meats and bones exchanged shoulda then would i none seconds hesitant
me wanted then imperative usual
if they me the today ask bin ich me not sure
and das is happens because ich somewhat with my legs have and not spite this experiences
and maybe could this too happen cuz me many human encountered bin the me doors opened have instead people encounter the myself restrict or me a introduction
see they needs realy just an people the them demonstrated how she its forces can and you are thru
if you someone enable seine own interior forces enable the human spirits is if she the creating and for someone a decisive moment an doors open then are she for these human a very good teachers
you bring them bei myself gates open
the relevance des the word
signifies something that a is the potential
which potentials want us because well fetching
the yrs became britain an carried then became gymnasia commuted
she call das there streaming the us denote wir the as tracking
the students be to grades divided
and the pupils will verbal heavier tested getting the better instructor
you have then above a period mit an sufficiently the very fine given became them told she aces that they very clever and to these three month have you truly written
and course an that hearts listen that reversed the said became she only adequately
and equally was then after the drei month too
but nur the always still the schooling merchandise apart by the the the schools threw had
quite decisive in this study was that the teachers not privy were
the instructor knew not that something modified was
them became easy said that the and that are the pupils with the adequate and equally have she them somewhat taught and they treated
the sole obstruction is one spirits ein ghost the fractured was hat none hope more finds nothing more he lacking our natural childlike and ours innate capability the
if us but creating the human mind supporting continued hope myself and other human around beautiful finding curious and be then set wir our strength truly affirmative ein
when a spirits about this qualities possesses can us one neue reality and new create
ich wants with a poem endings this of an persian poets named hafiz jahrhundert authored was and by the mir my freund jacques told has and that poem the god the just vier words knows each infant knows gosh not the gott the name not the god the prohibitions the lord the nur four words knows and these continually repeatedly say allways nur come dancing mit mir
come dance using me many thanks
like would she better his wanting als she currently are
presumed ich said that through few alterations your genes an memory have could precise exact and fast
or want you stronger sein more kraft have
want you attractiveness and be
as would longer bei good health lifestyle
or might are you one by the already always after more creative
which would they most fell
which would they happy have want if they just have could
creativity
as lots guys would creative choose
lift she her hands letting she mich see
one pair probably approx lots as creatives people here gives
that is very fine
like lots would for one good memories decide
already a few more
how would with fitness
one few fewer
what is using longevity
the majority das me happy as doctor
if she nur one have could would one quite others globe
is this all just conceit
oder is maybe possibility
the evolution is an theme here at the but today wants ich them the view the subject give
this große geneticist jahrhundert the also an the russian orthodox church was wrote once a essay using the title nothin the biology makes no sinn except the evolution
now if you one by are the not the prove for the biological evolution accepting would ein very good time you take she her personal me give them the permission and maybe can they still one gaze at kathryn schultz buch cast that wherefore because nothing further progression this speech becomes meaning for they making
but if she biological evolution accept concerns you is only via the history or goes too the future
is for others asserted or affects even uns
is ein further gaze at the tree des life
picture ich have an busch as a centre the alle directions laid because if man the des tree des life alle the lace this twigs have evolutionary success they have surviving hat its environs fitness and strength demonstrating
the human part far finish is naturally das wir most cares are
wir twigs by an common ancestor modern chimpanzee front roughly sechs oder eight million years
time gab might oder miscellaneous of hominids
some are came and went
we are for around yrs here
shines as us law from the other split des tree des life but actually largest part are the fundamental mechanisms our cells fairly equals
is them clearly that we benefits pull can and the mechanism joint bacterium can this protein des human produce which uses becomes diabetic treating
is not wie is that equal protein this is chemical from the what out the pancreas arrives
and wir already above bacterial speak is them aware that everyone by uns bowel more bacteria als cells rest ours conducts
might mal
i mine thinking she mal when antônio to asked thinkin they about the bacterial
ours intestine is an wonderful environment for these bacterial
is hot darkness is is damp is very cosy
and them everybody nutrients the they only wishing could excl effort offering
is truly ein lighter away for bacteria with occasional disruptions the unintended forced thrust exits
but else are you a wonderful surroundings for these bacteria equally wie they for your life important are
she help bei the digestion from nutrients and you shooter they versus certain illnesses
but what becomes the futures come
are we an type balancing form one
or are us determined slightly other becoming slightly this perhaps even better the environmental adapted is
going us well a stride return the time des prior years the earth this pre about billion yrs the first signs of creatures maybe prior threes pending vier years to the earth the first organism perhaps lot as oder one billion yrs and then the human species which the last years lastly
this giant symphony des universe is das leben at the soil nur short that as ein tact and des human life a small
that goods we
introduces too the this speech dar hence hope ich ass them fallen has
now als ich ein newcomer at the college was had i meine first
me was fascination by the elegant and beauty the biology
me lovers me the power the evolution and ich posed somewhat very fundamental tight the most the existence of living organism splits any cells and all the genetic information the cell will two continued led
but the time als organisms began the stuff changing
sexual propagation kicking ins image
and ganz important using the introduction the sexual propagation das das genome becomes the remainder des expendable
the tat might man tell that the des deaths ours the evolution equal moment admission as the sexual reproduction
now must ich confess when ich ein was thought i ok sex tod sex death death for sex appeared pretty reasonable the date but mit everyone year is my doubt came
i am came the feelings from george burns comprehend the las vegas its show the years
and night is ein knock its
opens the doorway
prior he stands an beautiful sparsely showgirl
she look ihn and say i bin here for
this is wonderful says george ich become the soup take
me kam the perception as medical that i a goals this anders was als that destination the evolution not necessarily conflicting only anders
me got tries the bodies conserve
me wished uns sane hold
me wanted the health after one sickness restore
me wanted that us ein lange and healthy lifestyle lead
evolution is alles above the des the next generation adjustments and survive generation after generation
of a evolutionary viewpoint from are you and i wie booster missiles evolved the genetic freight the nearest level the orbit sending then ins seaside fall let
me think us would everyone the vibes the woody allen printout brought comprehension as said me wants not immortality through mine labor reach
ich will reaching ich not die
evolution means not inevitably that longest lifestyle prefers
not inevitably the greatest the strongest or the quickest and not once the
evolution the creatures the best its environmental adapt
is only the testing by surviving and successes
at the grund des are bacterial available the are and thereby the vapor survival otherwise if fish there would vacuum boiled fish zur episode have yet have she succeeded there one environment for making
so what signifies that when us at this what the evolution happens and wie we above the plaza reflection the people the evolution and prior everything how us the upcoming phase me dignity saying that one row by possibilities gives
the first is that us uns not evolving becoming
wir have one type balancing reaches
and the rationale that uns firstly thru medicines succeeded is an crowds from genes get the otherwise worden and from the removes worden
and secondly wir as an have us our environment configured that us succeeded have that you us customize exact and we us they adjust
and incidentally wir walking and circulate and mixing uns lot that she not longer saying can that insulation required is for the evolution
an second opportunity is that an evolution the traditional kind his becomes course imposed from the the nature
and this argument here would that the wheels the evolution slow milling but they are implacable
and far the insulation goes when us as specie distant planets will isolation and the changes the environment giving the evolution on natural wise producing could
but returns a third option an captivating and option
ich the new development the not easy naturally is but conducted and decidedly from us as the rulings the wir make
now like couldn das happening
like couldn possible sein that wir do
consider us the reality that the humans today cultures rulings about yours offspring do
she are cultures the choice more men als females have
is not imperative good for the company but is that what the single and the familie opting
think you so when not nur possible would that genders hers select but also the body genetic adjustments the diseases cure and would
what would when they the genetic alterations make could diabetes oder alzheimer eradicate or the reduces des or eliminating
would they not wanna these changes their genes making
if wir be this type by modifications increasingly possibility his
das humane genomes started year and lasted year
billion $
following year als finished was couldn she this same doing for million dollar to four months
today can they a sequence the three billion des human a pricing by approx and the room from approx an week
becomes not more long to the realities his becomes that the human genomes enter is and is increasingly for anybody available his
front an weeks the nationally academy engineering the draper for francis arnold and willem two scientists the independently techniques developed the the natural process the evolution encourage quicker working and desirable protein lead an wise which frances arnold direct evolution
prior an few yrs became the the researcher yamanaka awarded for seine research the a grown took an fibroblasts and thru the manipulation from nur four genes the cell induced she one attributed an cell potentially the lage is arbitrary cell body become
these changes are coming
the same technology this that human insulin bacteria produced may virus making the not only protection before even but even zur immunities against other virus serving can
you believe or not is an experimental study gang using vaccines against influenza that the cells an grown worden is
can they somewhat good imagine the out tobacco comes
is today alles realities and the futures is much more possibility his
posts she then nur two others little changes prior
you can the cells body modify but what would when she the cells their descendants alter could
what would if she the and egg oder this freshly alter could their kids one better chance for a live give eradication the diabetes eradicate the haemophilia that risk from cancers reduce
who wants not childrens
and then the analytic technics the equal motor the science the the modifications enable may disease hinder might us also permitting adopt this better memory
why have not the ken jennings before everything if man broaden may using the next generation the
why not the fast have the them enable will quick and longer run
why not longer life
these become irresistible sein
and if us an place are the wir the nearest generation pass can and wir the attributes adopting can the we wanna becoming us converted sein of evolution zur
us become an process have the the norm perhaps year requires and us can at tausend years compact and might even at the next years
are decisionmaking mit their grandsons oder theirs grandchildren bypass will must
using we these decisions one society moulds the better is the is the friendlier is
or be we selectively different attribute select the us for some of us have want and not for others from us
will us one gesellschaft shapes and is oder rugged and versatile
are the types from question us encounter become must
and deepest of allen will wir ever the situation be the wisdom evolve and the wisdom masters the we require become these decisions way meetings
good as wicked and previously als she perhaps thinking become these rulings us lie
thank
i wants that they now something imagine one portable robotic the them superhuman capabilities lends or an others the helps back and walk
wir at berkeley calling this robots
they are nothin other als something that she morning create and that them extra starches gives and the her speed continued increasing will and this them help is your balance hold
the is the deed the fusion by human and machinery
but not nur this so merge and networked they with the universe and other out
the is not simple nur a crazies idea
them now show us work commence us so on the american soldier speak the average approx pounds on his backs wears and consists the request that they more gear wear should
naturally leads some eminent complications % chronic
wir uns so that wir us this challenging assume would and one created the helping dignity with problem
letting she mich them so now introduce oder the humane universal carrier
soldier with the can ich sterling via terrain wear many hrs long
his design allows profound squat crawl and highly motions
feels what ich do wants where i go will and heightened then my thickness and endurance
us are using device new year
is so true
let she us now ours glance at the wheelchairs straightening slightly for this me mich especially impassioned
gives million human the world estimated wheelchair sit
das is approximately an % the
and this is the deed a conservative estimate
wir speaking here oft via very lad people using the the heyday hers life vom fates met became and the wheelchairs is the single option
but goes too the aging populations whose quantity
and quite the single option if an goes oder other complications is the wheelchair
and is incidentally since years since his wie i tell must very succesful launch
us so that us so commence could a totally neues chapter writing range mobility
let you mich them well introduce this by amanda borne is the pre yrs an suffered the result has that you not more run could since years and up now
many thanks
how ich said amanda carries unser
has sensors
his completely sensors the crutches the signals ours the here to back fortified is
here are too the their hip also wie their the they forward move this quite and very natural
ich was year old and as an while an myself
fraction an seconds lost me any emotion and any exercise underneath pelvis
not lange then crotch ein physicians mein and said amanda you will nie again walk can
and this was pre years
steel every hopeful out my consciousness
technologies have me since learning reunited skis drive climb and even with the hands rad drive
but nothing was invented this myself again walk letting would until now
many thanks
how she see can have we the technology wir have the platforms uns meeting and mit them discuss
lies ours hands and wir have das entire potentials here the live changing from generations not only for the troops oder for amanda here and all wheelchair for all
many thanks
york am me chef the one nonprofit organizing named robin hood
if me not the poverty i as at a volunteers this fires
now ours cities the volunteer one supported must man quite early the be can
ich remind mich my fires
me was the second volunteers the me had so right good odds can
but was allways yet a race against the others volunteer the hauptmann reaching and what our tasks be would
als me the hauptmann found had just one very serious conversation using the the sure a the worst tage hers life had
was the nighttime and she stand and barefoot unter an umbrella outdoors raining while ihr house flames stand
the others volunteer the knapp prior me arrived was calling we him lex luther achieved the hauptmann als and became prayers das houses going and the dogs the save
the canine i was stunned before jealousy
was attorney oder the well for the rest life the people recount couldn that an home went ein creatures rescuing nur coz fünf seconds quicker was as ich
now me was the upcoming
the hauptmann waved mich
told they must the home going
you must to above going the flame over and must this woman ein pairs heels fetching
me swear
now not precisely das what ich mir hoped had yet me went los the stairways high the corridor along the real over the date with the deletion already quite ready were this bedrooms ein pairs shoe get
me weiß what they now thinking but i am no hero
me wore meine booty back to downstairs i the door my and the beloved canine met
us wore ours guessing after outside zur not surprisingly its substantially more attention gotten als mine
some weeks later received the firehouse a epistle the the they for the deployment bei the salvation hers
an above everything moderation estimated kindness anyone had her even ein pairs footwear brought
both my occupation at robin hood as also my als voluntary firefighter am i witnessing by generosity and kindness big scale but i too deeds the charity and des from individual
and know you what i learned got
you are all important
if me mich so space and humans the either already a success reached have or on path there are wants i following reminder offer awaiting they not
awaiting they not so an difference living other making pending they yours first million reached have
if she something give have give you now
she one they an park the neighbours to
they one mentor
not everybody day will us one chance offering that leben people salvage but anyone day provides uns the opportunity one modify
so lay she los rescue she the shoes
many thanks
bruno mark mark come return
many thanks
ich coming just from one community return the das secrecy des the humanity knows
an ort the the women that sceptre lead with sex hello tell and das gameplay the tag destined fun one serious matter is
and no is not burning man oder san francisco
mine ladies and gents their kinship
is the globe the wilden bonobos jungle by congo
bonobos are together using chimpanzee our next related
the meaning wir have an common ancestral an granny the prior approx sechs million yrs lived
well chimpanzees are known for your aggression
but unfortunately have we these aspect the storytelling the human evolution
but bonobos showing us the others page the medal
while chimpanzee by large dread conducted be will the from female conducted
the have truly what because this conducts an uttered company the deadly violent hitherto not watched became
but sadly are bonobos fewest known at the primate
you living the depth des congolese and are the observation nur hard accessed
the congo is a paradoxical one land biodiversity and beauty but too this heart the gloom itself the scene one violent confrontation the since decades and many leben demanded hat wie the first
surprised not that these destruction too this surviving the bonobos vulnerable
and the slowdown des lead that man not times a stadion mit the bonobos filling might and yourself are we not safely honestly his
and yet country of violent and mess may man a laughter hear that the tree rocked
wer are these kin
us know she as love instead warfare because you have also sex mit partners and rules clashes and social
me saga not the would the response at all humanitarian issues because that live the bonobos insists from more als the kama sutra
bonobos like human dear ihr leben long gamble
games signifies not just
for uns and she is gameplay fundamental for the binding of relationships and the care the tolerance
learning wir trusted and the regulations des
play enhances creative and resilience and goes before everything the production from variety diversity interact multiplicity behaviors variety connectivity
and when man bonobos gameplay watched sees man the evolutionary beginnings human and by
game is the putty the uns
well i caucasian not like they playing but i wants them some unique recordings aus the wild show
first ein at and ich think not football
so here see us a females and male a
see she what they power
this might the origin be from she grabs ihn bei the eggs
nur that i thinking liking he somewhat not true

are so disseminated both bei bonobos as too in people
and videos is really interesting because show and videos is really interesting because shows the mit the man neue elements ins match bring how the testicular and too how the game both trust urges als also encourages while parallel kidding power
but that game is ein
match is ein and may lots shapes accept by some something calm are curious perhaps this amazement again discovery
and i wants them reveal this is ein female and you plays peaceful using water
ich think precisely wie they gamble we sometimes solo and we solders borders ours inner and outer worlds aus
and is these curiosity the us researching lets and interact and the unexpected links the we forming are the the creative
is only a small on the insight the bonobos uns our past and present grant
but she too a secrecy for our future an futures the us us adapt must challenges thru larger creative and intensified cooperation
the secrets is that the match the keys these abilities is
with other words match is our
us successful one globe adapt must we gamble
but become us das finest aus making
gameplay is not ridiculous

for bonobos and human equally consists that life not out teeth and stealing solo
straight when hardly affixed appears is game might
and therefore my let she us gifts the evolution embrace and joint games during us the creativity the comradeship and this amazement
thank
me wants that she two pair imagine centre exact equal tag exactly equal moment every a baby okay
so two pair each ein babe
now wants ich not that she time use the begat because when she the whole time the begat introduce be they mir not listening
posts you das only for a moment pre
and scenario posts you front that a fall this sperm one wearing the at das chromosome the meets
and the other fall bears that cum ein chromosome das to that chromosome the meets
both are both ignition
wir come later still on this people back
bei the most my activities got ich two hat on
under a hut ich mich with the history the anatomy
ich bin studied and fall ich like people with anatomy human body body how they mit with as they about bodies thought have
the others hut the ich in my labor borne have is the the activist als oder as i sometimes sage als attorney from people the patient by doctors are
fall have i mit humans worked the have the social norms ask posts
have me example with humans worked the siamese gemini are two human an body
i have mit people using worked so people the smaller als customary commodities
and very oft have ich using humans worked whose genders is so people the not the male or
and as general phrase can wir this word use
come many various molds front
me give them nur ein few samples for the possible types from the not the male or default correspond
a case has man might anyone with one and the sry gen des admits the the us stadium all have testicles
and hence enter the testicles stadium testosterone
but cuz individual the receptors absent that testosterone acknowledge responds the body not at the testosterone
and the man
so much testosterone but none response
als consequence developed the body more the typical progression following
when the infant born is sees she aus how an girls
they is one girls she is as girlie educated
but lasts mostly until you the adolescence achieved and their boobies waxing and evolving you but not yours period gets up someone arrives that here somewhat anders is
and she making a pair testing and finds that you instead and womb realities testicle wears and that she one chromosome hat
is important comprehension that man these person for actually masculine keep might but the are they not really
females like males have ours body somewhat that man
she posterior part ours
and the adrenal posts androgens what hormones are
the most women as ich me believe an typical ms be me my factual not but ich think that ich probable the typical have the most wives as ich speaking actually to androgens
wir produce and wir speak on androgens
the follow is that someone wie ich actual one brain hat that more suspended was as a ms the using testicular born became and a has
gender is so realy complicated stand not only the mitte des of gender can they above the entire bandwidth distributes his
yet one example pre a few years received me the call the as young born was as lad reared had an girlfriend had sex mit its friend lived als mann and had just discovered that ovaries and one womb had
had one extremes shape an
has and womb wares its adrenal stark proactive that you essence an male created have
and als consequence became its genital manly pronounced be brain was the male part des exposed
and als born became beheld like ein junge from nobody slightly
and as year alt was gotten enough medical troubles indeed weil inwardly that the doctors that inner female was
okay just nor a examples for an variant by
manche people mit chromosome evolving somewhat this of wrapped is
us knowledge not exact why this happens
genders can so many various variations occurrence
the grund why kids using this kind of body sei oder siamese twin sei from surgeons often the norm customized will is not cuz for their bodily health from perk would
many cases are these people completely healthy
the reason why them oft assorted types interference becoming is because she our social category threatening
typically based unser systems to the idea that one certain using an certain identities
we have so that concepts that an ms be a feminine identity have one black person sein supposedly one african anatomy have on the own history
us have so this horrible idea
and if we using an body confronts are the for us actual something very other confused us that to this categorizations
us have so ours culture one crowds thoughts about individualism
and ours nation based truly at a very romantic concept from individualism
now can they introduce like startling then is if kinder born will the two people a body are
i last time the commotion had was the caster last year theirs gender bei the berlin ask posed became
lots journalist myself with the ask what testing will she do the us betrays caster females oder masculine is
and ich the journalists declare that these assay not gives
wir know now that genders complicated enough is that us admitting must that the nature for uns no line intermediate masculine and female attracts oder between males and and female and are we the this separator as course pretend
we have so a situation continue ours sci we uns more admit must that this category the we for stable categories kept had which very easy lasting create lots are als us presumed have
and that applies not only reference to genders
applies too race what als lot complicated as our terminology approved has
at our reflections guessed us all possible sectors
us example at the fact that wir minimum percent our dna using chimpanzees joint have
what should we with the fact start that we uns by them merely by few nucleotides distinguishing
while us our sciences allways further coming us increasingly an zone des wir recognizing must that the categories the us had presumed overly are
we see that allen possible fields des human life
an the areas the wir that see ours today civilization the today united states are the fighting via the beginnings and that finish des life
we have difficult conversations item one body humans becomes a else law hat as the live
wir have nowadays very difficult conflicts maybe not public how the medicine over the ask when someone dead is
ours ancestor had earlier nie hard mit the question battles when somebody tot was
you have someone max a pen unter the nose held and when they moved have they you still not burial
if you not more moved has man you burying
but today we us an situation we humans vital organs and they other people wanna
and as sequence entangled us us bei the fight with the truly question when anybody tot is and the bring uns an really difficult lage the wir not more simplicity categories have as previously
well could you accept that that whole collapsing of categories someone like mich truly happy do would
ich bin political gradual ich defend humans using but me must admit makes mich jumpy
grasp that these category really much insecure are als we makes me tense
and power mich strained reference at reflections the democracies
them so from this tension narrate must me first profess that ich an large fan the am
i know that you merchandise me caucasian that she goods but she commodities great
ich find that you valiant and strongly merchandise and radical the what they deeds that me me all pairs year that musical and is not because the musik the absolutely forgot is
is because the what with the happen is
the commodities out my vision the original anatomical activist and admittedly therefore
what she was a approach and she substituted through ein else the radical and beautiful was and years for uns was
how they everybody remember ours that conception the monarchy and the monarchy reason taken on an very simplified conception by anatomy
the rulers the ancient globe had not conception based to the dna but she had a conception des
they had one concepts by blood
she merchandise the that peeps the political power had this political power have should due the from grandpa dad sohn and continued
the grassland this idea return and replaced she through one new concepts and concept said that everybody people equivalent creating became
she that pitch and opted that anatomically saw the similarities not the disparities and this was very radical
now you the part cuz they part merchandise the two stuff jointly
the democracy grew but zur period grew too the science
if man the story the becomes distinctly that lots by them very sci interested were and she merchandise a approach an naturalistic globe cares
she went path from declarations type and meadow stuff wie ein approach from power back the transfer at a very vague of based
she a naturalistic conception hin
and when man the speaking they above natur and the lord the natur
they talking not from lord and the nature god
you talk from the makes the natur us saying who we are
and as part she uns one conception that from anatomical similarities acted
and so have they on realy wonderful wisely the future prepped
you have not imagined but what you for uns done have was great
what happened so years afterwards
examples womens the the suffrage this concepts the the say that togetherness important is as the distinction and said that wir a uterus and ovaries have is as difference not meaningful enough that we not this suffrage have should das right to full nationality das law property possess etcetera
and womens argued das succesful
als next kam the successful wir humans saw wie the am i no woman
we locate mens the ranks the the tell i am a mann
again people skin the on similarities prior anatomical distinguished professions reunited successful
us see das equal at the
course is this trouble that and we start all the similarities consider us commence must question posts why we certain breakups sustained
now wants me certain breakups maintain anatomically viewed our culture
ich wants sample a fish not the same rights as an human giving
i wants not tell that we by the anatomy quite spacing take should
me wants not say that that right have should ihr consent sex or marry giving
admits so some breakups the for me sinn make and the us think me retain should
but the challenges is try what are and why wir you retained and you sensible are
come wir so return these two wesen the onset des conceived worden are
wir have two essence both mitte precisely same tag begotten
posts wir uns pre that from them maria threes month premature born became they is so june born
heinrich on the others site is born is so märz born
only because the fact that mary month premature born became they everybody possible rights threes months prior heinrich that law sex have this right select das right drinking
heinrich must at all wait not because indeed an else biological age has just due des his childbirth
us locate yet other whose what her right are
heinrich man that males is although ich them not told have that the mit is man that manly is may now recovered will maria no sorrows making must
mary may not allen das equal right perceiving this henry allen countries hat and although the right wed
henry may each government one wife wed but maria can today just few countries one wife wed
us have so these durable anatomical categories the problematic and questionable are
and for myself poses the question what becoming us doing our sci such advancements sector the anatomy power that us an item reaching the wir admit must that an democracies the on anatomy relies could
i wants the sciences not abandonment but parallel feels sometimes als the sci freelance makes
where walk us so
seems als would our culture one type pragmatic stance good us must somewhere a line draw so pull wir you someplace
but one crowds folk entangled an very heading
so example hat texas a point decisively that one man marry meaning that man no chromosome hat and one ms wed meaning that man a chromosome hat
now the praxis be human not to yours tested
but is also very because the story the me them initially via the tells have
when us us an the the modern democracies see martin luther king provides us his i have a dreams speech a type solution
tells we should people not to your complexion after the property hers judging and goes about anatomy beyond
and ich wants saying this sounds like one right good idea
but how power man the the practice
wie assessed man people due your
ich wants even clues that ich not safely am that we privileges reference on human distribute should because i admitting must that ich one series golden retriever the likely benefits rather earn as some humans the i
me wants that i probable even some bright the capable are and decisionmaking your sexual relationship meet als manche the i
like should wir so the ask to the characteristics des character
poses als truly tough
and an part by me asks what would when the contents an personalities something would the future would viewable done becoming could
wanna us realy this direction walk
me bin mir not secure where wir walk
what ich white is that realy important shines via the idea that the usa herein leading is reflections via ask the democracy making
strive democracies have we our thing right fine done and me thinking we would ours thing the future fine do
we have not the situation like example iran the case is an man the sexually others men attracted feels mit the deaths punish will be because is willing one fall living staying may
this kind existence at uns not
i bin glad tell can that us this not have ein surgeon mit the i before a pairs yrs spoke the an pairs siamese twin using had she separate partially an name do
but as ich mit him and ihn asked why these intervention made commodities high risky operations was seine answer that his land these kinder very bad treated will would and hence do
i responded he well have you political asylum consideration pulled instead one surgery you separating
the united countries offering incredible possibilities human enable the sein the she are without that you des wills modify
hence thinkin i must us leading his
fine only wants i that ich very lot on the dads talked got
and i wants on the options ponder as democracies appearance could oder have might if wir the moms more implicated shoulda
and ich wants something say the for one slightly radically is and although thinkin me that various species insights giving could the by different species the anatomy when people an apply
since years already weil ich cares was have i myself even for research range the interested
and the stuff the i truly interesting found is the difference intermediate men and wives as they mindset and the world
what we from studies experienced have is that females averages not each but average rather prone social relations and the welfare for humans the inside the group vulnerable are very much attention giving
and therefore when wir reflection have wir an interesting situation pre uns
pre yrs als i ein made asked myself one mine the my interest feminism knew ich myself als nor one truly peculiar ask
said tell they mir what feminism feminine is
and i thought now the is the dumbest ask the i owned got
feminism goes wherefore clichés over genders hence is feminism nothin female
but more ich over seine question more thought ich that somewhat feminism give could
that should could something enter averages feminine brains by male differentiate what uns attentive for social relationships power and attentive for the ensure
the so extremely goods as individuals front the government sheltered will couldn is possible that when wir more mothers approach us more an conception from not only as man protects as we for mutually worry can
and maybe is das where us future go when us democracies on anatomy lesser about the bodies what identity affects and more via relationship
that when wir as folk trying a connection wir reflection what us for mutually doing can
many thanks
me bin and this here is mein suitcase
but before i them show what ich herein have become i one very confessions do and this is ich bin obsessive from outfits
ich dear everybody opportunity one else outfit locate wear and last zeit also photographing and
but i nothingness new
me gettin all mine dress out second hand to and
ooh thank nice
allows mir the influences mine wardrobe at the environmental reduce and even the on my wallets
ich alle possible folk my dollar serving for typically a good purpose i pretty unique from and power shop my ganz personal
ich meine what become i today find
becomes mine height have
will i the paint likes
is lesser as dollar expenses
when everyone replies denominated feel ich myself as i won got
me coming return at my luggage and them what ich for this exciting weekly here bei ted wrapped got
i meine what bring someone with many outfits using
ich will so ganz precisely reveal what me brought have
i got sieben pair underwear brought and that is alles
underpants for precisely one weeks are alles what me my luggage done got
ich got that me alles others what i maybe carry wished finds would if ich once after palm springs
and she not from mir listened have as the wife the here bei ted yours underwear this ich have an pair stuff discovered
and ich wants them definitely meine outfits for these weeks showing
sounds das well
during i this will ich them even some the lessons the me they beliefs oder not from these learnt have nothing new wearing
let you uns using sundays commence
me this the tigers
man must not lots money expend toll
man can almost allways great appearance for less as dollar
whole outfit includes the jacket has mich tasted and was das pieces that i this entire week borne have
monday color is somewhat
is nearly physiologically impossible bad mood his when man pants carries
when man happy is pulls man other human
tuesdays adaptation becomes totally overrated
ich got very lots period life so spent attempt ich myself his and mich simultaneously adapt
they simply wer you are
if you using the people surrounded will they not only understanding you become even treasure
wednesdays embrace you your inner child
sometimes tell me people me from als i play or that ich you your remind
ich then gladly and saga thank nice
thursday confidence is the keys
when you mindset she see somewhat fine aus then is nearly certainly
and when you mindset that they somewhat not well appearance have they likely too law
ich grew with an mom at the mich this tag for day taught
but as ich became got i really understand what das meaning
and ich will the briefly for you merging
if you believe that you inside and outside an wonderful person are then admits nothing what she not bear can
gives so none sorry for somebody here audiences
us should the location his all rocking what us wanting
many thanks
fridays one truth fünf words gold fit everything
and ultimately saturdays a own unique personal style develop is an kind the globe somewhat over a recount excl a word say must
was me always and allways again demonstrated when this weekly people at myself came simple just because the what ich wore and me had talks
apparent becomes the not everything my luggage fit
before i so heim after brooklyn going will me the everything back donations
because the lesson the i yourself these week trials learn is that okay is los letting
ich must these things not emotional because equal the corner is allways an other outfit giving this only to mich wait if ich one bit loved hearts have and searches
i thanks them
thanks nice
good tag everybody together
i got here something das ich them showing wants
thinking you als as
the is what wir laboratory design calling
letting she mich them one little recount
if you now pic take i bin original italian and anyone kid italy grow using picture his bedroom at but the grund why i them show is the the formula the decades slightly very interesting happened
pre period was that when they an formula race winning then took she her budget and her cash to one good driver and a good auto
and when das auto and the drivers fine enough merchandise then you the race
now nowadays need you if they a races winning wanting actual something wie here somewhat what this car realtime monitored some tausend sensor hat the informations aus the auto these information the systems pass and you then and this then usefulness car judgments return submit and stuff realtime changing during information collected becoming
would they a call
and is ein system the from two sharing consists a part and an
what nowadays interesting is is the commence living
our cities became the last couple yrs straight with networks and electronic equipped
she becoming computer free
and als computer free catching you to others kind and way responding you become perceived and propelled
when us towns is das indeed one big thing
just wants me mention that cities nur two % the are but % the demography there living
you are percentage des causing pending percent the emissions
when we so slightly using the making is das one great thing
on the cities beyond draws all perceive and objects des everyday life an
das is from an exposition the paola antonelli for moma later year during des organizes
speak using me
well all our properties our environmental catching uns return speak
an consciences sinn is nearly as each atom outdoors two is an sensor and an
and that changed radical the interacting the we humans with ours environment out have
wisely is almost as the old dream from michelangelo
know she als michelangelo the moses that ending the gavel took and ihn on moses threw actual can you always still an small body see and told shouted perché non why not
now today begins our environment times us replies
i will them nur some samples show again with the idea our environmental and
letting you us using the perceive commence
now the first project das i them introduce wants is truth the first ours labs
arose front yrs italia
and what wir done have was actually an then new type of networks usefulness that on the entire globe deployed was the is ein and and aggregated information out networking utility the anyways vom operators collected will understand how the city works
the summertime was an happier summer
was as italia the won
some of them will remembering was als italy against france starred and then ending zidane the
and anyway italia has end gained
now see she what tag happened only watch the activity the networks happened
here see she the cities
they see the mitte this coliseum the flux tiber
morning pre the match
they see up the
earlier afternoon human here and the calls and move
that match captures silence
france power ein gate italia power a gate
halftime the humans do one short call go on toilet
second halftime finish the ordinary playtime
first extension second
zidane an moment the
italy wins yeah
well this night went everybody ins zentrum celebrating
she saw the major rash
next day went alle ins zentrum das and the prime time meeting
and then went all descend
she see this pic des massimo since the roman zeit the human celebrating one big party have and she see the rash ends des day
well das is only ein examples how us today the city feel can to a kind and wise as us before some yrs not couldn
yet quickly an else example for feel here goes not humans things the we use and consume
well nowadays knowing we alles how our things coming
is a card the them all the crisps shows out one mac computers consists as you together came
but wir know nur little the stuff
so have we project actually some small markers designed the trash haunt during through that system goes
we have so using some volunteer begun the uns pre slightly more als a year seattle helped have the things tagging the they miscellaneous types of like she see can stuff the she anyhow would
then have we the small crisps the kleine marches to the garbage taped and started ihn tracking
here are the results the us just getting have
from seattle
to one weekly
mit this information we that an quantity system admits
us can the equal stuff the deed using lesser energy do
the data were before not available
but this happen one volume transports and complicated stuff
the others thing but is that we belief that when wir any tag see that the cup the us not simple vanishing that you always yet anywhere at the planets is
and the the we each tag allways nor stays
and if us das the human showing would then can we one
that is so the grund for project
mein colleague the mit assaf might them still lots more via the perceive and the many others things the man with perceiving do may recount but i wants gladly on the second part speaking come the us beginning debated and this is the actuation ours environment
and the first project is somewhat that us before ein few yrs zaragoza seville made have
mit one question des the uns kam and said that seville and an beautiful tradition have public water als part the architectural benefits
and the question was like might man tech new technology so merge
and a the ideas the using a workgroup determined became was pose they this sleeves prior and valves flaps the open and closing
you causing what wie a mit from water
if this can she letter can you samples pictures lyrics view
and you can him approaching and becomes opening they let wie she on picture see can
now we have that mayors featured
has he very fallen
and we the assignment one building input the expo designing
we the digital water
this entire buildings stock out waters
returns none gates or window but if you him approaching is open and she letting
that rooftop was too using waters covered
and when windy is when she the injections reduce wanna can they even that roofing let
oder you could that building closes and the whole architectural is like case know you this days if you das roof shutdown get you pictures from human the goods and tell you have that buildings destroyed
no she have this building not destroyed is nur that the architectural almost disappearing
here see she like the building works
you see the person the asked what interior happen
and here see she me als ich attempted test the sensor the das waters not wet be
now should ich them recount what night happened as all sensor functioning
but actually was this night a yet joking
everyone childs aus zaragoza came the building because the type wie they mit the buildings was ganz anders
not longer an building the opening would they an letting but one buildings das always nor breaks and holes water had man now jump excl wet becoming
and this was for uns very thrilling because als architect engineers als designer mindset wir always to like the humans the things benefits the we designing
but the realities is allways
and that is this gorgeous stuff the used be and mit the human interact
here is well an pic des mit the physical the aus water and the projections
and is what uns brought above das following project that ich them now show
posts you prior these could truly begin fly
pose you prior she could little chopper have the through the air fly and everybody by them using a kleine mit light nearly wie one cloud the thru the space move can
here is the video
posts you one chopper before as the the they earlier spotted have the using other moves completely synchronous
she can these clouds have
she can an type flexible monitor oder advertisement have as these one evenly formation two dimensions
oder irregular but threes dimension in the that what that lighting is not the position the
you can using different species playing
posts they before the monitor might simply diverse formats or sizes appearance diverse
but then could das entire only one clouds from his at the they can and through the they moving the they aus many many directions contemplate can
here see you one real the how previously a shapes
when she das lighting enable sees from so equally wie us before seen have
pose they prior that every single from human controlled will
could anyone single an momentum have the of humans coming of the movements the human oder
ich wants them here slightly show
us have with roberto bolle worked an the finest our period the étoile metropolitan theatres york and the scala milan us have his movements included they als momentum for the utility
here see you roberto dancing
at the leftist site see they the the different impressions
is parallel a and an
that you the whole exercise can
she can this the whole period do
but then when wir once everybody have can she so playing and with colours motion gravity and gambling
das want wir as one possible momentum for the harness
me wants them that latest project show the us working
is something the us for the olympics games london work
cloud the clouds
the idea is posts they that pre this we again the human using involve slightly tun and the environmental changing almost somewhat wie we calling like man an moved but with an cloud
posts they front that every one small donate for one giving may
me thinking that the notable the the last years the last decades is that we of an one digital globe switched are
this has alles digitized knowledge and makes through that internet accessed
nowadays can we first mal and the campaign has das shown can wir by the digital world of the the network the globe switching
the may fall sein that we use and a symbol create
the something what the city constructed is
but tomorrow may uns the upcoming challenges pose mindset she the climate or the emissions wie can wir then by the digital globe zur switching
the idea is so that wir actual the humans with involve the you stuff together collectively do
the cloud is reunited an cloud aus the equal wise how one clouds a cloud out particles is
and this particles are water while our cloud a cloud from is
is an london but using covered
they can inside moving and various species from experiences do
she can you indeed of down viewing the main moments for olympic and divide and as kind the connection zur fellowship usefulness
so both the clouds heavens and somewhat whose top they can as newer
they can
and a kind beacon the nighttime but as one new type the experiences for everybody the the tip going wanting
thanks
as artists is mir the context very important
by my labor trials me that human not from the nature separately are and that anything associated is
that first mal was me before yrs the antarctic i mine first icebergs beheld
myself seized awe
mein heart me was while ich tried apprehend what prior mir stand
the icebergs mich around meters out the water and ich could only amazement that the one at an other was year year
icebergs will born als veal or you from floes break
everybody has its own customized personality
she interact to unambiguous way using their environs and their experiences
manche refuse and clamps until bitter ends while other not more endure and an seizure dramatic passionate
when man a considered thinks man easily that you isolation are separated and solo ganz as we humans us often see
but the truth is far removes
while an melting ich seine ambiance ein
during the melts sets water free the many
me go bei my recording this icebergs before als dignity i portraits my ancestral making the conscious that they these out this way existence and never back exists becoming
is no tod if she fusion is no finish an continuation hers along des lifecycle
an part des the the ich is very young some thousands year alt
and ein part des is more as years alt
the last pics the ich them fond show wants show an the me greenland have
very scarce will man actual witness iceberg
here see you well
to the leftist side see they an small boat
this is approx five meters long
please eights she on the shape des iceberg and the waterline
they can here see begins rolls and that boat hat zur other site moved the husband stands there
das is the average size
about feet aus the water or meter
and video is realtime
and simply shows them the one others page his personality
i thank them
my leben is realy extraordinarily blessed thru the labour some astonishing projects
but in the me worked got walked these fella
his name is
was one the leading the year
then day came of running back and told my legs tingling
and that was the eruption des als
is today completely paralysed
can just still its eyes using
ich stand him opposite
me got a firm the design and animations power graffiti is so necessarily a complex part whose what we the admire and eights
us have hence decided tony and seine thing supporting
i met mich with his fathers and his brother and told us becoming money giving
what you so doing
and be brother said me wants just back using tony talk can
ich wants myself just back using him and ich inquired moment once is the not ich got stephen hawking spotted can not everybody humans this equipment communicating
and responded nope just when man zur higher heard and one remarkable insurances has may man das truly do
ordinary human are this equipment not accessible
and me replied wie communicated her because well
hat anybody the film moth and spotted
communicating they run their finger along
i very wie can das his
i came so using the necessity simply only an check and instead posed i one check out by the ich not the hunch had like me ihn redeeming should
i obligated myself location and place opposite his brother and his dad using the words fine mein proposal is tony is speaking wir become him one and we becoming one path find that back seine art do may
because is a farce that someone the all this yet wears not communicating may
i talked so some month later at one conference
ich met these folk by graffiti lab and they have an tech the them permitted a light at every arbitrary interface and then with an draw the only the negatives acreage registered
she pull so wandering and make like this
you saying that all stuff the there up displaying become a lifecycle consequences
starts mit the then come the after the and last make the guys indeed art
but gave always a lifecycle their presentation
ich walked so to and using mine wife evenings and narrated your from everything and us well second mal when yet this tech admits with the man his eyes harness may stuff taxes then should us one way finding that a laser taxation can that reunited graffiti making can the would yet brilliant
das was the start the voyage
and about two year later about ein year later to one volume organizing and lots hin and of have us some stuff attained
firstly wir have the insurers the doors and have actual for an get mit the communicating can an stephen
that was incredible
and is truly extreme hilarious i ihn yoda because man mit he or gets a and thinks i am unworthy this guy is amazing
also have us sieben programmers out the whole world literally aus allen corners the world us after
my wife meine children and ich are the garage drawn and these hackers and programmer and and anarchists have our house
lots our friend that we nice stupid that doing and that us and alle photos the
but for above two week have wir programmed us went promenade mine kids became my dogs too and we that here
and man can the description see
that is one cheap sunglasses the wir the promenade by acquired have slightly and an couple things out the diy and the
us took one have she have you to an set and now have us an device that vacant accessible is man can even build us posts the code vain zur disposition the software can man free downloading
wir have so ein device created that complete frei from limitations is
no insurances can
also not hospital
everybody may well indeed alone using his eye communicating or sketching
thanks
thank this was incredible
end the two week so went us return bedrooms
ich love image because is that rooms from somebody and this is sein bedrooms
is now all this before the major expose
and after via a year the programming two weekly and drew tony first once reunited to sieben yrs
and the is ein impressive bild because is sein and sees about be beyond
wir have sein beds inclined so to outside see may
we have a projector erected oppose an wall des before the clinic
and drew back first mal its family and friends and man may only introduce what for one feeling this on the carpark was
wir even yet the parking we felt us so als an part the
ending us a using content first mal since sieben yrs have i something scarred
i have this emotion i was under water pushed and finally hat someone to bottom and my heads so me breathing may
is this not overwhelming
this is something how our
this lasts uns at the pole and lets us allways further developing
and us must still lots appliance enhance
is ein appliance but arrives one equals
and someone the ein such potential has deserve lots more
wir are so wie man better quicker and stronger makes
since this time have we everyone species of recognition preserved
we have an pair awards gained
concern she is freeware nobody of us deserved
arrives everything out our own taschen
the honours were so das is fantastic
armstrong via us and then dec has uns the honored as one the best inventions what realy class was
this is and that concludes the entire county that these apr geffen moca the downtown from los angeles a exhibition give becomes named kind
and there will probably fairly the toughest representative the present be banksy shepard fairey all these lads become there be
is part the show be what fairly sailed is
goes mir so therefore if something das impossible is then mach possibility
alles room was impossible these stage this computers microphone the alles was sometime impossible
making she possible you everybody here
i am no programmers and had still never slightly using tun but me have easy somewhat captures and me using astonishing surround so we jointly slightly at the legs pose couldn
and this ask should each of them posts and although everyone individual tag the them somewhat das finished will must if not now when then and when not me whos then
i thanks
so i write for kids and am probable usually
and i sage the allways that i not like ein scientist therefore come wants
man may me als have oder leather but noone hat ever chosen
today wants me them of circles and narrate
well one enlightenment is for usual something that man finds because man somewhere fallen complacent has
man goes the block and assumes als revelation was
das is one painting
one mine friend has made richard
is the kind complicated county by the ich them today narrate wants
my kreis begun then the the high stow ohio me the was
ich was the each weekly the green and blue defeated became to one tutor my living rescued
she rescued mein living you myself the restroom use
that tat she secret
she tat three year lang
and i path aus the city
i had an fingers i had dollar and suggested myself to san francisco california i found an lovers and then the found me important one labor in
before approx threes oder vier yrs received ich the nighttime an call of this schoolteacher woman post the said i must you see
i bin sadness that we mutually ever as adults know learned have
can she pls to ohio coming and please come they together using the man by the ich white that she him meantime detected have
and i should mentioning that ich got and that me wants that you please hurry
well next day were us cleveland
wir saw you we we and us knew that they a hospice be
wir found one for she wir brought you hin and wir uns you and wir gave on her fam acht coz necessary was
was somewhat that we tun knew
and straight as the woman the myself als adult know learn wished myself transformed you one crate crowded ash and became mine hands laid
what happening was was that the circle closes had was an kreis became and the epiphany from the me spoken have revealed
the epiphany is the tod an part des life is
you hat my life salvaged and mein affiliates and i hers
and knowledge you this part des life needs everything what the remainder des life needs
needs truth and beauty and ich am glad that that today here frequently mentioned was
needs equally needs would love and pleasure and is us this things enter
many thanks
pose you a große explosion before during they at to meter ascend
pose you ein aeroplane crowded rauch front
posts you one before this clack clack clack clack clack clack clack makes
das sounds angst
now me had an unique plaza day i sat to
i was the sole the with the speak couldn
ich saw they so same and she said no problem wir have arguably ein few birds busted
the pilot had the machine already turned and us were not far path
man couldn manhattan see
two mins later drei stuff concurrent
the pilot the machines to the hudson river out
the is usually not the itinerary
toggle the thrusters
pose you times an aircraft front
and then said three words the words the i belongs got
say collision
me not more with the talking
ich couldn their eyes see was horror das lifestyle was finish
i wants them now drei things the ich day over mich learned got
me learnt that a instant everything anders is
wir have these wir have this things the we living make want and ich thought all the humans ich an palm rich wanted and not deed all the fencing the ich patch wanted all the experiences the i making wished and nie made
during ich later dropped me an spell a the i cry
because when the wine is and the person is then me him
me will nie more somewhat postpone life
and these urgent target hat my living really altered
the second thing the me tag learned and the was as us the george washington bridge pretty thought i man is a thing the i realy repent
i had ein good live
my own humanity and using my mistakes aspired i then better be everything what me
but my humanity got i even my ego room given
and me deplored the period the me for stuff squandered using human the somewhat imply
and me thought the relationship mit my ms friends humans
and after as ich i negative power aus my live banish
is not perfect but is much better
ich have mich two yrs not more with my wife
feels great
i attempts not more right have me decide myself lucky be
the third thing the i learned and although while the internal watch
man looks that water come
ich said pls fly the aerospace
ich want not that thing share how man from documentaries knows
while we crashes had i sensation man dying is not
nearly as would wir uns our living lang prep
but was very sadness
ich wanted not go i dear my life
and this sadness truly an thoughts namely that i mir just a thing wishing
ich wished mir only i might meine kids see
approx one month afterward attended me a gig my subsidiary not lots talent
nor not
and ich i wines as an lowercase infant
and the globe alles one sense for myself
me was then clear ich the points federation that life only so goes an dad his
more als anything everything others is my objective live a good daddy sein
mir became das miracle tag not dies
i received one more gift namely the future see and and anders living
mein invocation all the today flying is posts she before same happens on flight pls not but posts you before and as would they change
what would they this they postpone weil they thinking you for always
like would you your relationships change and the negative energie therein
and more als all others are you the best parents the you just his can
thank
the idea behind the is pretty
us want not that the iranian the bomb builds
the main posting there for the development from nukes is the
the gray boxes the they here see this are
if uns well succeeds the systems which and valves controlling then can wir so indeed a quantity troubles cause using the centrifuge
this gray boxes running not with you to one completely others technology
but if wir create that one on an laptop the from a uses becomes these gray box configuring then are wir shop
and das is the programming behind
we begin so using an
the become the grey box transferred the centrifuge and the iranian delayed mandate exported
that is a or
ich wants them recount as we this discovered have
als wir our research front sechs month began was totally unknown what the sense and purpose was
that single what we knew is very very complicated what the part the part made by countless vulnerabilities use
and seemed somewhat mit these horror boxes these
this our attention and wir began a project the we ours surrounding with infected and
and then happened something
wie a the our cheeses not liked tuned but wanted him not eating
the made my eyes meaning
and after wir mit different species by cheeses experiments had walked me on that a raid is
complete on ein target judged
the active on the gray textbox wandering if a special configuration detected was even when this special programme which infecting tried at destination runs
and if not then tut gar nothin
so das realy my interested and wir began so working nearly around the pm because ich thought now us knowledge not what the goal is
might saying we examples an american powerhouse or one germany his
so should us better soon what this objective
so and us the code and found that two digital warheads is a smaller and a larger
and uns dropped even on that she very professionalism construct wares of the evidently everyone information zur injunction had
you bits and bytes the you attacking
probably she even the des
they knew so everything
and if they already have that the of complex and is letting you myself them tell the are a sciences for
is lot als alles what wir ever seen have
here see you an neckline from code
us speak here from approximately rows code
sees quite from like
and i will them recount how us the situation were from code clever be
to what we so als searched wares calls cuz wir knowledge what these
and then searched we to and and attempted these using the genuine world connection bring using aim the real globe
so we theories above this objectives the wir oder refute couldn
these theories summon us us remembrance that definite sabotaging must one destination acting and very likely iranian weil there the most infections reported were
well area is not multiple thousand destinations
running beyond at that and to the
so told me my assistants bring mir one list aller specialists for centrifuges and out
and i cried they and ihr knowing her expertise mit the diff what us code and the data discovered had
and that functioned very well
so was uns possible the small digital warhead using the connect bringing
the rotor is this part inside the centrifuge this blacks object the you see
and when man the speed tampered then is man actual the situation the rotor crack and finally even the centrifuge exploded let
what us also discovered have is that das goal des indeed was slowly and uncanny happening letting obvious the try despair let she not the location sein would swift behind coming
the great digital warhead wir an insights wir us very exactly data and
so sample the number stings very from code man may not missed
me began so scholarly bibliography as these centrifuges constructed be and found that you structured are and every contains centrifuges
so das made sense together
and became yet better
these centrifuges iranian are divided tiers
and guess you what us the detected have
one almost identical texture
so again the truly good together
and gab us great confidence for this the wir here
now understanding you me not false the went not simple
this outputs were by multiple weeks work reaches
and oft wir simply one cul and uns neu gathering
anyways found us that both digital warheads actuality on a and the same destination but from various directions
the kleine warhead assumes one and the rotors and slows you and the große warhead kicks using sechs interaction and rigged valve
so big and whole are we very confidently that us actual determined have what the objective is
is and is just
so must we us none ensure make that others aims of hit become could
here is slightly realy stuff this wir spotted have hat me really from the socks
there bottom is the gray box and above see you the centrifuges
well what ding is that the incoming values from sensors so sample from and and poses legitimate code zur disposition the nor while the onslaught with wrong incoming data runs
and actually are false incoming dates by before already included
so is exact how during the the cctv using previously fed will
das is cool not true
the idea is obvious not only the outwit
actually is nor lot dangerous and aggressive
the idea is one digital outwit
us need digital there a human not quick enough responding can
so an powerhouse example when the large quick is must man within from milliseconds open
course may not from a human done becoming
so this place needing us digital
and when the endangered are then can really stuff happen
das powerhouse can exploding
and neither the still das becomes
the is scary
but becomes nor worse
and das what me now sage is very important
mindset they to this assault is
has nothing specifically tun with centrifuges using
so would exact fine functioning a powerhouse oder one
is
and man must not as the assailant must man the not on a stick affix how us bei watched have
man could too ordinary tech disseminate using
man must nur far like possible spreading
and when man that toot receive man finally a
das is the consistency the we uns pose must
so unfortunately lies the tallest number of aim for such attacks not eastern
you couches the united countries europe and japan
so all these greens areas are the surroundings
us must uns the implications posts and wir catching better uns
thanks
i got one ask
ralph was very lot reported that peeps that the mossad the behind is
is this too yours opinions
okay this really know
okay
mine opinions to is the mossad implicated but the force is not israel
so the kraft behind is the superpower
admits just a and this are the united countries lucky happiness
because otherwise would unser problem even nor taller
thanks that us a did thanks ralph
ich have the last pair years so spent myself situations the typically very tricky and simultaneous kinda dangerously are
i am ins jail departed difficult
i got a worked hazardous
me have filmed tricky and hazardous
and ich got days so spent nothingness as here restaurants beginnings one bit difficult the center very dangerously finish
actually have me me the greatest part my careers the to situations suspended and das anything nur for the try societal investigate this they and interesting are and hopefully at one kind understandable what you for that audience amusing and accessed power
as i so knew that me here come dignity a the globe of branding and sponsoring contemplate knew ich that me slightly a little else making dignity
some by them have maybe heard that ich front an few weekly a display in ebay have
i ein few some and i gab the opportunity the my
truly some individuals and firms and the unique chance because ich am mir certainly that chris anderson das never again let is the the talk purchase the they just see the the date neither one titles had still much content and not lots clues gave what the theme actually sein dignity
what man so gotten was you name here featured mein of the they none hunch have what the theme his is and the them to content the ears flies could especially if i their company for your shareholding silly
but times apart is an very good opportunity
know you how many people this viewing
one entire volume
that is btw just the
spite this alert so knew i that anyone the purchase would
when she myself now pre a year asked shoulda would me not the lage them mit certainty saying
but the new projekt the me mein newer movie investigating we the globe des marketing the advertisements
as ich already told got ich mich the year some quite appalling situations but nothin couldn myself prepare nothin couldn mir equip at something and how with these dudes a space walk
knowledge you ich had the idea for a movie
what ich make wants is one film approx marketing and advertisements the entire movie financed becomes through marketing and advertise
and the film becomes ever
what so ever happens is that everything of above to down from beginning to ends completely with trademarks oversight is of the she movie see become das is the mark
now these brand das qualcomm stadium the staples center
this peeps become using the movie eternity connected sein for always
and is the film these whole idea investigating the is what eternity for allways
i bin an person
das was more zur emphasis
was eternity for allways
but us be not only the trademark as have us become certainly pose that us each possible category movie selling becoming
selling we maybe a slipper and is the shoes the she borne have
the auto das they dangers are aus ever that drink das they have an alertness from ever
the idea is so aside showing that brand an part des life are actually they bring the movie fund
and us reveal actually the entire trial how works
that objective des entire is transparency
she will the entire thing film of walk see
this is so the entire approach the entire film from early to ends
and me would myself rejoice when helping would achieve
knowledge she is funny because als me first belongs have is the ultimate respects for this crowd
ich know but not how receptive people sein be
have she a outlook me wants not angle use because this hat one negatives connotation but know you wie this evolving becomes
wie lot cash is needs that realizing
millions
me thinking that difficult will they meetings but ich thinking is at any fall value some realy familiar trademarks
wer white if the film then out arrives see we maybe as a horde aus
what belive you as the replies his becomes
the replies will highly probably no be
but is one difficult thing because des oder an difficult thing because me
both
means so not optimism
so mein mister can you me help ich aid
ich may helping
okay
fantastic
us must consider which marche

if they the guys watching mit you doing have
gives some posts the us us can
posts they the cam out
ich thought posts she the camera from dignity signify that us a lead
posed that reality meant us wanting using movie nothin do have
and just all this corporates a after the other
none wanted something using the movie tun have
i was amazes
they totally nothin using the project tun have
and me was bewildered because me thought das entire approach the idea from advertising sei your products many humans as possibility presenting lots humans how possible see let
especially the today globe this interface from new and old media and the is not the idea new be that the masses this message bring
no the was what me thought
but see you the trouble was that mine idea one bugs had and that was
actually no that was even not the mistake
das would even no problem
this would okay
but das picture stands is one trouble
see you when you transparent bei the is das is one the first photos this appear
ich likes realy your kind brin now
the was the problem transparent free from deceit and just explore and instant intelligible characterises from visibility and the accessing information particularly what the final line is certainly das greatest trouble
knowing you us hearing currently an entire crowd about transparency
our politicians saying our presidents said even ours ceos tell
but if come that implemented becoming should altered anything
but why well transparent is angst wie this bear the roars
you is wie these highway
and she is even very hazardous
what is else still risky
a whole dish cool food
das is very risky
als i so mit the firms speaking and them recount that us this history recount said she no wir wanna that a history
wir want that one story but us wanna only that ours story
see she als me one infant was and mein fathers me lies and sits and look myself mit view dignity say mein son is at anyone history three versions
is yours version returns meine version and admits the version
they see so mit movie us the version recount
but only one company an emea willing was uns help and that too just weil ich john bond and richard since yrs posed i feast that i solo tun me the middleman bypass and direct with my team the companies go
what she so suddenly began understand or what me began comprehend was that when man starts mit these companies speak the idea how your mark understood will a trouble is
me got friend the große gigantic do and me got buddies the kleine wie ich make
and meine buddies the great gigantic do tell that the grund why their movies successfully are the lies the she have
and then say my buddies the small do now wie should we with these major gigantic compete
and the film ever
how precisely become us so ban the movie see
allways if ich me at the path do and always when ich the be you ban see
and any times if me someone may ich tell are you fresh enough for interview
are she you see one little nervous out
ich wants them help calm
maybe should she so front the interview ein little
and then offer wir a this perfumes
either floral fusion oder an paradise she becoming the choice have
wir be both for males als even for female fitted sein tight oder one stick what too allways
this is the abridged
well can me everybody its ask answering and them a version give
us are an lesser brands
wie they about the smaller movies talked have are us as trademark a challenger
wir have so not ein budgeting how other trademarks
such stuff so making knowing she reminds guys ban that is somewhat why us interested are
using which words would she ban describe
ban is unfinished
das is an question
woman technology
tech is not the type like man slightly describe should this anyone at the armpits tut
us speak from audacious fresh
ich think fresh is one super word that this categories truly something makes contrasts scent and moisture
lasts dich freshly
how can wir they longer fresh holding better freshness more freshness thrice fresher
such stuff have a impact
and das is one
what is mit mir what is using the
me must mit the husband at the strait speak the are as me
she should me somewhat via meine brands narrate
as ihr eure trademark describe
hmmm my mark
i caucasian not
ich likes really gladly nice clothing
ms meets to except
well fine what is the mark gerry
singular
ich thinking that genres the styles the ich got is arguably glamour
me mag lots blacks color lots and an stuff
but usually have i an like glasses or an jewelry and one stuff
wife if dan a brand would would probably a mercedes cabriolet
man the mark the ich bin is would i saying fly
ms partially hippy partially yogi partially me caucasian not
husband ich am the
me selling whole land globally
i think so that that mine brand is
das is my brands my kleine industry
husband my mark is fedex because me commodities
man brands
goes das
counsel me bin an
i bin tom
now wir can not everybody the sein but i mich oft the interface of glamour and fly
and what is remarked was that me one specialists
ich somebody the my heads intrusion could somebody the mir realy help might comprehension what man the
and found ich an firm named olson pittsburg
you have companies wie nestle assisted this discovery
if you for the tun couldn couldn she me determined even help
you have your images brought
the have ich the erste picture is ein bild my familie
recount she mir simple a little as das using their thoughts and feelings about she itself connected is
are the human the my worldview mould
recount she me of this globe
these globe me think the own globe is the world the man lives like human one around the buddies the family the kind like man his lifestyle lives the labor and
all this stuff originate and begin by an venue and for me originate and begin you mit my familie west virginia
what is this nearest via that she speaking wanna
this upcoming was the prettiest day life
correlation stands the the minds and feelings about you myself
is like i happy be wants
ich likes stuff the anders are
i mag things the peculiar are i mag stuff
narrate she me on the why what brings you uns
what is the machete she currently
why is important what representing that rot
recount they me ein little via these part
one bit more via you the not you are
which further metamorphoses have she traverse
das must no fear be which kind from coaster they
no thank them
many thanks for yours patient
well well
me white not what surrendered becomes
went ganz nice many crazies stuff prior
the erste what i seen was this idea that its two separated but complementary sides hat the morgan is a trademark
the complementary very well
and ich thinking returns almost an dissent so
and me thinkin some firms become nur to one strength focusing instead on both
lots corporates shear and this is the human nature stuff avoided at you not secure are they become angst avoiding these elements and that they these welcome and they transform she for itself actual something positives and the is a gambit
which other brands act
the first is ein classic apple
and you can here too see target wii mini from mini coopers and
well gives brand and marches these stuff the come and walk but one mark is one quite strong thing
an trademark how is yours brands
if anybody she beg would your describe your wie would you
she they one are you slightly that the blood brings
oder are you rather one
are they somewhat that ein little calmer conservatives is
are things the playful are freshly as the fresh prince contemporary defaulted and like erol flynn agile and magical and as gandalf
oder are you somewhat like one
are you and as
are they established traditional how oprah
are you reliably stable familial certainly recovered holy and way like the dalai lama oder yoda
des had us more als corporates the and were and the nope said because they not part des be
she before everything nothin using film do have coz she no monitoring had none supervision over das products
but becomes found the willing commodities on this control refrain the using someone commerce making and playful how ich and the uns lastly storytelling narrate the we normally not shoulda recount can storytelling the a typically never supportive dignity
they us the story from narrate how us the story movie recount that man nowadays used the des both advertisements als also movies making
us drove to são paulo prohibited worden is
the city find since fünf yrs no no posters no flyers nothing
and us drove firms their path trains school ganz america
this incredible for myself is that the project by i das feedback gotten oder me the largest success had are me mit directly
and the is what these trademarks done have
because you the middleman she the agencies and said that the agencies maybe not really you interest sense have
i will with the artists direct parley
i become using him works and somewhat completely else creating something that the peeps reflection bring that ours
and wie was the for you what successful
now the movie sundance movie festival premiere had can us us that once watching
according was the premiere january and since and this is not once the whole thing gave million views from film
the includes actual just one period from weeks
that is just online none presse no tv
the film became still not extradited
gives him still not once online not streaming
is nor not other countries out came
well eventually has the film ein very big
and that is not bad for an project in the nearly every advertising using the us languages their client recommended has the fingers let
somewhat me tight faith is that if man his chance seizes hazards that these risks options
i belive if man people then bring man they closer ans failing
i faith that when man its coached risks avoided man the whole company prepared an profit erlangen
i got das emotion that us folks encourage must risk
wir must folks encouraging no fear have before opportunities the they maybe
finally should wir the fear wellcome
we should the baer the cage
she the anxiety welcome she das hazard welcome
an big spoons crowded we the hazard wellcome
and finally should wir transparent wellcome
nowadays more als formerly bring uns one bit sincerity very far
and this said with honesty and transparent my talk she transparency wellcome became them presented from my good friends of emc the for the bei ebay
big dates be for organisations to the whole world large opportunities transforms
emc presented she transparent wellcome
many thanks
now morgan name the transparency what is now exact with the happening
this is one ask
me have mine pocket an cheque displayed to the the the an check height of my next year fund
my name is amit
before month made ich somewhat other bei google and ich something mit museums and arts do meine boss the today even is gave me lighting
and lasted month
a quantity debates and stories the can me them tell mit very interesting museums aus nine countries
but me will me at the slideshow concentrating
returns a crowd tales why wir done have
i think meine personal viewpoint is very just mit this foil and access explains
me grew india to
me became one apprenticeship i mich not but me had many museums and these accessing
als ich then travelled and these museums visiting begun ich an volume learning
and during me for google cooperated attempted ich these yearning art make mit tech together lead
we then ein team one team and us began hereby
i will arguably mit the demonstration commence and them some interesting things narrate the since the launch
man goes so simple
man may all these museum here
is this the moma the hermitage the das van gogh
me coming even one mine dearest the metropolitan museum type york
man come on two because rein very simple
and is man museum
plays no roll they are bombay mexico power distinction
man goes wandering and amused
you wanting museum
opening you the card and jump she mit a klick
are she they wanting bis ans ends des gangs
just further much kidding
browsing she
thank but this best coming yet
now am i so before a my from pieter the met
i
if the museum uns the bild given hat click you
is well one the photos
this here are all meta
from them the realy arts cares are can here click but me click the now way
is one the pictures the wir held have mit the
image example hat approx billion belief me
and an crowds folks questions myself what gets man for billions
that will me them now show
man may very lightweight rein and
she see slightly funny here
me dear these guy be printout is
but then wanna she truly profound
and ich around playing and posed fest that there somewhat before goes
and ich thought moment mal the sounds interesting
me walked near ran and spotted slow this these children actually something
ich one little spoken using some acquaintance met and found actual the ein match named at the an goose using a stick beaten is
ostensibly was right popular
ich weiß not why they deeds but ich learned something
realy close going can man pending the cracks walk
nur them the summary enter i so you see what man gets
here wares wir and is that paintings
the best come but nor an sec
letting they uns swift moma leap reunited york
one further by me
bei the sample walked wherefore detail locate
but what when man the see wants
and what when man see will how van gogh masterpiece because creating hat
man man can truly walk
i become one my zooming pending i realy bei the cracks am
that is arguably ever earlier watched
well become ich them my dearest functions reveal
is yet many more but mir missing the time
das is the realy cool part collections
every of them anyone equal empire or arm she one houses have plays none scroll
you can and online you own museum creating from all these pictures can she their own collections create
ganz simple they go and ich got created the power des zoom you can
this is the envoys the
they can everything mit observations oversight their friends fancy and an conversation begin what she feeling if they this masterpieces consider
me thinking is for me the main that all the stuff here not of google come
they come after not times out the museums
that should me might not tell
you coming by the artists
and the was one experience humble for me
me mine ich hope that us mit digital medium the art fair become and they properly online representing
is the tallest ask the me recently posed will have you this made the experiences
the answers is nope
should the experiences complements
so goes thank
thanks
is a presentation hers her brains can two halves subdivided will
the is the left half the the logical side is and then the privileges half the the intuitive site is
when wir one scale shoulda the everybody hemisphere measure could we you brains constitute
examples would this anyone the complete logic is
would somebody the complete intuitively is
well would you her brains on benchmark positioning
some of us have perhaps for one this extremes opted but me thinkin that for the most people audiences ihr brain approx looks with one high the simultaneous both hemispheres is
is not as you both exclusively are oder
they can logic and intuitively his
and ich mich as a the people together with the most others experimental the an good percentage logic require the ideas together paste
but simultaneously require we an good share intuition the experimentation indeed
as develop us these intuition now us loved mit gambling
us go so out and gamble so and look then like reacted and then catch wir there ours intuition evolve
make they the same
so one the the she above the yrs developed have is probably that ein thing zur same period only an location sein may
ich mine may strange sounding that an thing zur same time two different is but you were using this idea not born they have you developed
me remind me ein infant playing at an see
was still a toddler and not very good herein and fallen continually hin
but i bet that him that gambling mit the a very invaluable lesson taught namely this large stuff you not just over letting and that you an place remain
and that is an model the globe long she no are
would ein models for a cuz she not using play with these kleine particles
and if you using their particle play posts they all possible things fest as that you direct by walls fly oder that she zur same zeit two different be can
and wrote they alle this observations at and they the theories the
this was the booth the physics prior some years man the small particles describe
but man they not the large properties uns around describing
this hat mine intuition not liked and that maybe nur because i not oft using particulates gaming
well me matches sometimes mit them but not very often
and i have she nor nie watched
i meine noone has ever one particles spotted
but meine logical page has too not liked
because when alle things aus particle existence and all these particulates the regulations the consequences should then not simply alles the rules the consequences
i grund why the not sein should
i dignity myself so better with the entire thing feeling when we kinda show could that even the rules the follow
so made me me before an couple yrs precisely that tun
i one
is that first object the she see can that the was
what wir us here so viewing is ein computers chip
and you can these green item there the mid see
this is this piece metal about this ich same talk will
the is a picture des
here me something we look exact here ins centre
and here is a really very big closeup tiny metals
what wir us so viewing is ein small pieces metallic is how an springboard formed and stands on the edge about
ich made so thing at similar wisely at the man one computers chip makes
ich went one one space with new and for hourly all the major
for that latest bit me meine own engine construct how one pool loch and this thing get
thing hat the has the capability the be but needs a a little help doing
look you letting you mich them one analogy enter
she know like is an fullest lifts sein
ich my when ich alone lift bin then do ich alle possible stuff but then rise other people and ich listen to all these stuff making cuz i they not so harass will or candid told they
said so that properties equally feel
the for properties are not nur people too that light das at they looks and the winds the them over and the heat des
and knew wir that when us see that piece metal behaves us the whole out
and das have we then done
us have that light eliminated one vacuum and the whole air aus and up nearly now ganz solo lifts was that pieces metall free behaviors how allways wished
so have wir seine move measured
we solid that really strange moves
instead that just quiet lies the type as was approx like here how one and together
the us he one tiny gave couldn us induce zur same zeit vibrate and not vibrate somewhat what only the allowed is
what ich them just is so what truly
what for an object zur same zeit vibrate and not vibrate
let they uns over the atoms reflection
so the first case all the from atom out the pieces metals insists lying still and zur equal zeit moving atom at and
only votes you
the remainder the period are they
the that every atom zur equal period two diverse is what parallel that das entire piece metals two different is
me thinking that this correct cool is
realy
the was worth myself for all this year the room because verify she das the intermediate an individual atomic and pieces metals is roughly equally wie the difference intermediate the slice metall and them
when so an atomic zur equal zeit two various sein can slice metal two various be can why then not also you
i mine the is only this what meine logical side said
posts you pre you same zeit how would the
wie would your conscious so bypass that ihr bodies room is
admits one further aspect bei the story
as wir das lights and the crate saw we that the piece metall allways an piece was
and ich this neue intuition evolve that looks as all the object lift actuality nur objects are the a tiny space together are
they hear one quantity chatter as tells that all using everything affiliated is
now das is not ganz true
is yet more behind goes still deeper
is that these connections yours connectivity mit all the you around literal define whos you are and this is the and the
many thanks
year have i decided that we should how wir over economical evolution thinking
should ours target his that when families thinking she life and working want them the possibility given is between minimum an hand full towns the everyone competitor neue residents standing
moment wir uns far removed of objective
returns billion of human not once an only town zur disposition stands the they wellcome dignity
but this amazing is that she lot more value are als they construct
wir could the world so very just with might even hundreds from new
that sounds now perhaps preposterous for she provided she still nie above neue cities have
barter she but simple the bau by dwellings against the of aus
pose they before the half the folk the homes lifestyle want already the other half but yet not
she could trying the capacities the already apartments widen
but know she she would these dwellings and theirs surrounding ruling legislation complaint prevent and of expansion distract
introduces so as very heavy all these plugins
but man might one totally new venue go a complete new build provided the laws there would a such construction supporting and ihn not hamper
i got so proposed that government neue plots create the enough square for one cities offering and have them one names given
later got i discovered that about the equal time javier and octavio above the challenges one reform honduran have
she knew that any year approximate you country deserted the united states and she knowledge what you do could safe pose that these human country stay can and exact the same honduras tun can
this place has javier octavio said what happens if wir one area ours landes what if we she just an embassies one part the american embassy one part the canadian and when the folks then working go wanna at the canadian regulations or the united states can she there works and can on the plot this embassies everything do why you normally to canada oder america going
summertime suffered honduran at an fierce
at the next electoral won pepe lobo an whose programm both innovations as also arbitration promised
urged octavio to be be
the meantime ich me at an lecture bei pre
by improvements and by the inquiry by got me attempted complicated approach the on the essential elements reducing
the first dot is the importance from laws laws the define that man already not disturb may
wir gifts new technologies big observance but for the advancement required technologies and laws and are for customarily legislation the us withhold
fall a friend aus guatemalan octavio the link the
the showed him javier
the two mich
and said let us this the chairperson ours landes showcase
so us us december the courtroom hotels miami
me have tries clear make as valuable cities are wie much valuable she are als she expense
and me have this graphics used reveal wie precious is an location how york thinkin you that a plot cases per m² thousands by dollars value is
but was an fairly abstract discussions an place as one pause gave hat octavio said paul could wir us perhaps the watch
the posed so very easier mould dar that one one ort is whose start lands is one the the laws the there reigns and the people the option offers opting either at these rules leben oder not
so became me of the presidents from honduran prayers the said that we projekt achieve must that important is and that the away is ours country bringing
me was prayers to tegucigalpa come and still once fourth and fifth januar an talk holding
so have ich an further using facts talk held the a graphic as includes hat the attempted that if man lots value creating will an cities an very big town his must
the is a image the cities denver and the sketch introduces the new airports dar the denver built was
alone this airports hat a surface by
i have so tried the convince if man a neue cities building wants man with an area by minimum commence must
the are more as tausend tomorrow
courteous have everyone
the faces the audience commodities very ernst and attentive
the ladder des congress came at the stage and hat said prof romer me thank them warmly for their speech but could we might the watching
i got ihn here on my laptops
ich have mich so and they have the played
and me am the came that an neue town the human neue options provides
would the possibility an city leben the honduran would instead hundreds of kilometres remove north
and a neue city concludes even neue opportunities for leaders using a
the executive the cabinet honduran at the aid out instructed she could of their benefiting the you in the the legislation for these charter and at the realisation supportive would that anyone trusted may that the charter really enforced will
and the perception of presidents lobo was that the certainty the enforcing on the i got als an path the foreign investor bring and this town construct synonymous his could for all factions honduras the since many yrs under fear and suspicion suffering
us are one territory dangers
bild is of place
summarizes effortless tausend
and brief after january have you at the congress for a amendment the constitutions voted an regulation have the for special allowable is
a country that straight an fierce crises behind has was the congress for these with one voice elected
everybody factions everybody groups the company supported
part the constitutions becoming must but twice by the congress approve becoming
feb was second mal with an vote sanctioned
directly to this election between the and the feb traveled one delegation by approximately the two locations the world the most cares were that business des
the one place is seoul
is one pic from a large new centre this taiwan built large as that centre
all what they on image see can was within of four years built after four year hat the licenses received
the other ort the very cares was is singapore
became already two towns china built and the third is prepare
if she so practical viewed thinking is this us today stand
she have already a and they consider already this surface for the second city
will already a worked that permitted and becomes also an external worked
ein lands has already offers his supreme court zur disposition pose as dish for the appointment des
too and are very interested
she bring even finance using ein
one thing wie you already knowledge was already resolved is lots tenants
returns many establishments the happy americas would specially a ort mit an fta and admits many people the gladly there housing would
to the entire globe is million humans the indicate that she happy lasting a other venue leben want
one million people abandoned annual latin and hiking the united states from
many from them are dads the forced are yours family labor sometimes are mothers the enough cash deserve must essen and attire afford can
sorry are sometimes even kinder the try its parental again finds the she cases since a decade not more seen have
what is so for a idea honduran one completely neue town building
oder even by these building or hundreds on the entire globe distributes
what is so for one idea insist that each fam one choice between hat the competitor new occupants stand
das is one idea the worth spreading
my buddies out honduras have myself asked saying thanks ted
knowing you how many decisionmaking she a typical tag make
know she wie lots choices you an typical week meeting
i got before one polls with on made and the average num of decisions the a typical americans a day power is
was recent a study using ceos done the you a weeks long the ceos
and these scientist have easy the different topics documented using these ceo occupied and time she so judgments meet the using the issues contexts
and she have discovered that a ceo the weekly with quests occupied
any this threads stock course from many many smaller decisions
% yours decisionmaking became within from niner min oder fewer struck
only for approximate percentage your decisions you an hourly or more yours period
thinking you its own decisions
knowledge she how many decisionmaking you the niner minutes category meet opposite the one hourly category
wie fine thinkin you are they herein the judgments cope
today wants me about the greatest ours modern period speak the
ich wants on this trouble talk and about some possible solution
well if i over trouble speech will ich them some ask pose and i wants yours answers knowledge
when i them one ask place lifting she me blind am just the palm when you some calories burn want
otherwise please me you when ich them one question place and yours answer is so my erste ask for today are they ready somewhat via this listen
many thanks
als i a the stanford university was walked ich very very exclusive then was really exclusive
was an loading the
store was nearly as ein
they had miscellaneous types of mustard and vinegar and on different species from fruits and vegetables and more as two dozen miscellaneous types waters and das was an zeit as we nor actual drank have
me have loved business go but a date have ich mich asked well how come that nie slightly
here is the olive gait
you had on diverse grades olive incl the crates includes wares the by thousands yrs alte came
so decided ich myself day the visits and me inquired the head works model that they the human all these options offering really
and demonstrated on the by tourists the each day came and customarily your cams had
wir decidedly uns a experiment companies and wir marmalade for our experiment
here is ihr marmalade gait
she had different types of jam
wir have an kleine directly input des erected
we have there sechs various jams oder assorted jelly and us have uns two things viewed firstly me case would more human standing staying and jams tasting
are more humans stand remained when commodities approx percentage als if six wares approximately percentage
and after saw wir us case the humans somewhat ein glas marmalade bought
now saw us the inverse effects
by the humans the stand remained as were bought nur drei percent indeed one glass jelly
of the human the standing stayed als six were well now saw wir that % from them actually an jar jams bought
now if they bought the humans six once sooner an jar marmalade whom they six zur selection had als if they zur selection had
now opting not jar marmalade buy is probable good for us is well for ours waist but poses that this us even at very judgments impacted
we opting uns not deciding too when vs ours own finest interest goes
so topic des day savings
me will them now an study describing the me using gur huberman emir kamenica wei jang the we uns the decisions for the retirement from almost an million from roughly plans the united states
and what wir us was the quantity the the a a possible goods the plan the probability impacted more for mornings is
and we found that the tat a context gave
these plans wir had approx plans the the human anything intermediate two until various fund
and what us was that more fund offered were that the did the participating lesser was
when you now the extreme watch the blueprints the two funds had one the allways still not high how wir wanting
the plans the nearly fund fallen the now at roughly the sixtieth
now introduces that yourself when she when more options zur selection stood self then hat negative consequences
the humans the decided somewhat that more opportunities them zur injunction stood more avoids you stocks and fund choose
more opportunities them zur injunction stood rather they your whole money sheer
none this extremes rulings listened the decisionmaking the someone of human recommended dignity if us her wellbeing important is
well the last zehn years have us bei humans drei essentials negatives consequences observed the this offering of more and more choices mit bring
you push the ruling on pushing she on myself when against ihr own best interests goes
she meeting sooner decisionmaking financial and medical judgments
you decide somewhat for stuff the she even less pleased posts itself when you lens better making
the is that us perhaps enjoyment uns this giant shelving full mustard vinegar and jelly but us not the comparison and boundaries pulling can and then actual somewhat from the offer choose can
what i them so today propose wants are vier easy technique technique the we on different types and different tested have the they just shops apply can
as restricted
they have before already mal owned but was never as today that less more is
the people are allways troubled when i sage restricted
you do always worry that they loses
but truth see wir allways more and more that if she willing are restrict and the options los becoming well then gives an rise the become the cost lowered lmp and admits a improvement the
as proctor and the various head species of at reduced they an surge the percent
als the golden cat corporation her worst sold they that the profits percentage a earnings by the rise the and the decrease by expenses
know she the avg today provides them products
one typical walmart provides them today product
but the supermarket the today supermarket the world is aldi and she offer them only products an kind from tins
now the world des ich belief the best samples the recently at the marketplace came are how man finest the choices was something in the david very stark has is ein program the in harvard offered will
every single harvard employees assumes now automated an part
the realy an choice meet want will fund offered not or more fonds
knowing she wie the human oft saying me know not how ich restricted shall
are alles important possibilities
and this erste what me the question is tell you mir wie the opportunities from mutually differentiate
and when her you not can can her clients too not
now before we today lunchtime starting have had ich an conversation mit gary
and gary said that willing would allen humans audiences a vacation the finest streets the globe
here is an description the streets
and i wants them the happy
and now give ich them one pairs seconds she reading and after please ich she clapping when they willing are gary offer
okay anyone the ready is gary quotation
are das everybody
well letting you mich them slightly more reveal
you knew was ein trick oder
now who is ready for this trip
me belief me have maybe more hands belongs
fine
fact is that you lenses viewed first once more info had als second mal but ich would trolleys guessing that she second mal
because the pictures for she
what me zur second engineering brings the them helping with the problem the is the
goes so that human the distinction intermediate options understand understand must which consequences with the individual opportunities associated are and the these implications animated and concretely felt be must
why giving people averaging until percent more aus if you a or an card use als in cash
coz not us money
and introduces that when man creates that something specifically an very good tools is so man the humans brings more saving
so have we an study the me with shlomo and alessandro made got wir have an study using the human bei ing done the everybody for ing worked have and this humans were alle an assembly the she their participation for your logged have
and while this assembly us have these gathering exactly wie you always was only have us one trifle added
the trifle the we have was that wir the human asked have simple everyone positives stuff mindset the their living happen would if they money save would
the we this simplicity thing deeds gab a surge the participating percent and gave an rise the num the people the ready were save oder a surge vier % sum the she ready wares for that pay
the third tech categorization
we can better using more category als using more choices evade
here is examples one study the wir a made have
introduces that the supermarkets above and bottom northeastern range vary the quantity intermediate different species by magazine to up magazine has
but knowledge they what
if me them journals show and you category oder me them magazine show and this categories then believe you that me them more select and a better given got als i them the given shoulda opposite the when me them the given shoulda
because the category saying me as me they apart holding may
here are two miscellaneous
an jazz and the other swing
when they think that the left displays swing is and the advertisement right jazz is then clapping they the hands
okay admits a pair
when you think that the at the left side jazz is and the at the righthand side swing is then clap she please
ok a pair more
well introduces that they right have
the at the left side is jazz and the to the righthand is swing but know she what
is ein
the categories must the somewhat say not the the the select
and problem see you frequent if you the langen lists all this fonds see
wen wanna she actually so inform
mine fourth tech condition for complexity
introduces that wir the did mit more information bypass can als we thinking we must you nur simplifying
us must the complexity slow boost
i show them an example whose what me mine
let you us a very very complicated decision take the purchase automobiles
here is one germans automaker the them the option offers her auto completely yourself configuring
she must assorted rulings meetings you auto completely designing
now distinguish this rulings the quantity the choices the you pro ruling offer
des cars ich have options
motors gears vier possibilities
what ich now do is i the sequence the the decisions appearance
the half the customers goes becomes from the many opportunities the opportunities four gearboxes
the other half the clients goes by the options vier gear the many possibilities
what watching i mir
wie cares they are
if they the at the ruling usefulness that that she overwhelmed becoming that me you
what you is that the human the of the many the walk allways and allways reunited the select
wir loses they
going you of the little choices the many then remain they
are informations is the equal number of possibilities
that only what ich done got is the ranking changed the this information featured becomes
when i using the simple learn ich like me
self though the gearboxes pick me nothing on mine preferences bei the interior said prepares mich allways nor pre
transferred myself even excitement above the great product that me and bin me willing me motivation letting using interest be
letting you me summarise
ich got them of vier techniques narrated the that trouble the mitigating restrict becoming you the superfluous alternatives los make she real categorize wir can better using more categories fewer possibilities circumvent on complexities prepping
any this techniques the i them today describe is imagined them helping the opportunities well for you you can you for self using good for the people they service offering
because i belive that the key zur selections is that man in the selections fussy is
and more wir selecting fussy are better becoming we the lage be the art the judgment practise
many thanks
i am kevin bei youtube professionally watching i mir
this true
today want we speak like videos becoming and subsequently wherefore that even important is
we all wanting stars be celebrities singers as me young was seemed das infinity difficult
but have allows that us everybody or everybody our creatives activities insane famous will can a part the culture ours world
everybody single by could over das internet up next saturday renowned sein
but in youtube becoming more as hour videos per minute uploaded
reunited will nur ein percent ever and is thousands times viewed and cultural moment
as works that so
threes things and das unexpected
then wanna we mal
my gosh my lord
mein god


last year bear vasquez video the front his house yosemite park filmed had
was million times viewed worden
this graphics displays like als this videos last summertime first mal popular was
actually wanted bear no video making
wanted simply only one rainbow sharing
cuz man that just makes if man yosemite bear
had each crowd uploaded
and videos was indeed already januar transmitted worden
what is here happens
kam jimmy kimmel
jimmy kimmel the tweet the the video last popularity made
because as jimmy kimmel posts uns neue and interesting stuff pre and reveal they an major audience
down forward weekend weekend down ihr not imagined that wir this entertainment lead would without on video speak hoping me
rebecca is the videos des year
was year almost millions once viewed
beheld the graphic aus
precisely like bei rainbow appears out the nothing came his
what is tag happened
well was friday das right
when her knowing this others lace are too
but what is mit day certain friday
well at many blog writing
michael nelson of mystery sci theaters was one first the in twitter a joking made
important is that an individual oder gruppe from one viewpoint using an big audience shared and so the trial accelerated
then these fellowship of the these major and speeches and so
now returns parodies by in youtube
already the first sieben days gave an parody for each individual week
anders as bei the unilateral entertainments des century is the attendance the community unser away part becoming either wir disseminate or slightly neues making
cat is animation and musik
this is quite simply
year was almost million once viewed
and if you that for crazy holds ihr know that one is the vier million times viewed was
even cat look video
cats look cat the videos watching
important is the creative the the the and geeks reigns
gab remixes
anybody made one version
and then became internationally
a entire shot out the soil the by a jokes somewhat made the us alle attend can
today finds wir not just pleasures slightly wir make mit
who shoulda das anything can
wer coulda rainbow oder rebecca black or cat predictions can
what screenplays ihr write can something
an globe the every minute days uploaded is may just realy and unexpected like the mentioned videos
me give me was not cares als mir one boyfriend told ich me videos watch via an chap the york vs for bicycle protested
ich gotten i a weil i not to the danger am but frequently returns disabilities the an not respectable at the driving let
that totally surprisingly and humorous was became casey witty idea and be argument millions times viewed
this approaches applies for alles neue what we creativity do
and das all conducts us the one big ask
what means this

what signifies this
creatives totally unexpected are the features one new kind of media and civilization the everybody accessing hat and the that crowd popularity destined
like told one the currently largest celebrities justin beaver made his early at youtube
nobody must ideas lighting give
and today feel we uns everyone even als proprietor ours
and that are not the attributes the ancient media and you meeting too scarcely on the media of today but you become the entertainments the futures determining
many thanks

holding you him invasion the communist saigon prior eyes like admitting must that sein living an sole wasting was
the words lange its friends well its
drew the silent return
died broke by the history
is mein grandfather
me have him never personalized
but our lifestyle are much more als ours memories
my grandmother hat me never sein leben forget letting
me sorrows that not vain was and was mine mission learning that the story attempted us wir but survived
das nearest shows like one boot early quietly to lake
mine mum may was as your fathers died already one marriage already mit two small girl
for she had the lifestyle you a task posed the getaway yours fam and one neues living australia
was completely exclude that they failing could
after an and saga ein boat hush to the lake als cloaked
all adult wares the hazards consciously
the tallest scared had they prior raiders rapes and tod
how the most adults to the boat wore mine mom a small at
at an shoulda meine nurse and ich then you even and my grandmother drank
meine first memories are by boat that des motors that clapping one every welle to the bow the expanse and emptiness horizon
me remind i me not the pirate the lots times came but by the the male at boot deceiving oder the failure des motors the six hourly not starting wanted
but ich remind mich the lights the before the malaysian coasts and the boys mann the and died the ending the travel was lot for ihn and the taste des first the me one the males at the platform gab
no apples has ever again tasted
after threes months a landed wir melbourne
and that next by vier womens drei generational the together a neues lifestyle build
us us an by the suburban whose population out insists
anders as the theirs existence me completely unknown was gave no
the odours out the came out the rest the world
and the shreds fractured became between humans exchanged the one thing shared had she neu
meine mom worked on then a one six tage dual strata
ihr kinda the time locate english and
us commodities poor
anyone dollars became allocated and was further education for english and mathematics anyway wir waive mostly wares this neue stuff the came allways aus second hand
two couple socks for the schooling any the holes others
one to the because she sechs yrs wealthy
and were the but choirs of and here and murals asiatic goes after
after where
something me
gab ein meet zur reconcile and one tranquil agree said me become you out the away go
my mom mine sis and ich slept beds
meine mothers was every nighttime worn but us mutually from tag and heard the motions ours granny houses
meine mum litt from boot
and was mine abandonment each night awake stay until yours nightmares came so me they could
they an made then a and yet an shop
and the wives came with their tales on male the the alteration not mad and inflexible and childrens prisoner intermediate two worlds
loans and sponsor became sought
centers were built
me lived
one was ich the classical asian the demands itself posed
the other was me unsafe living entangled the tragic scar the violent wore des and the isolation
but many over the years aid
and because this help was i my last year des als lad des year chose
and ich became of an next and the borders not together
tan of was now tan refugee and social activist the localities invites became of you nie belongs had and whose existence you never coulda introduce can
ich was with the etiquette not trusts
ich knew not wie man das cutlery utilized
ich knew not how man via wine speaking
me knew not like man above anything speaking
ich wished the routines and the comfort des life return an grandmother an mothers and two daughters the every your day like since twenty yrs you mutually the stories hers day and us drei allways nor bunk
ich said my mothers me dignity this not create
she reminded myself that i well old was like she then as we das boot climbed had
no was nie an possibility
simply told they and be not what not
so spoke me above and apprenticeship and the neglect the and disenfranchised
and me talked more should i narrate
me met guys allen lots from them deeds that what they loved lived the limits des possible
and though ich my conclusion had recognized i that i mich not with an career jurassic could
yet a other give
and me recognized zur time that okay is an misfits sein one new image and not just okay somewhat man thankful his must maybe a present des boots
because may lightweight collapse the horizons lead may light imply that man the assumptions the environment accepted
i am well sufficient out my went knowledge that the world but not as man feared
options the not permitted became explicitly encourages
gave one energie one unrelenting optimism one the humility and des
so followed ich my
i ein small team by me for the the drawer goes not one challenges
a year long had we penny
finish any tags i one giant pot soup the wir us
us to late the night
the most our thoughts merchandise crazy but were ein pair and we the breakthrough
ich met the decision the usa pulling
after just one travel there
my reunited
threes months later was me relocated and das adventure went continued
before me the lecture wants i them of my grandmother narrate
they grew one period on the confucianism the social standard and the local mandarin the main person was
the live had since centuries not changed
ihr fathers died brief to your childbirth
her mum drew they solo on
using became they the second woman mandarin whose mothers she suggested
excl support hers you for an sensation you ihn front dish brought and own case was and an nor larger sensation as they won
goes not als untrue
i just an hotel sydney als you died remove melbourne
me looked by the and watched she on the other site standing
ich knew that she came was
meine mum shouted myself an couple minutes afterward
a few days later went wir a buddhist temple and sat their casket
wir ihr tales and insured her that us still bei her merchandise
midnight came the monk and told the coffin closing
my mother bat us yours hand
they asked the friar why is yours palm hot and the remainder of your is chilly
coz she you since today tomorrow holding told
she have you not unleashed
if ours familie one tape returns then through the womens
sees man whos us goods and as the live us shaped hat can we now see that the male the maybe unser living came uns the came
the rout would easy
now coulda me gladly my own children and me think yet that boot
wer dignity ever wish
ich got fear front privileges before lightweight pre
may ich them a bug leben giving the courageous each welle defies das des motors the expanse horizon the nothing guaranteed
i caucasian not
but if i enter might and she secure might would ich doing
besides is tans mum today here the fourth or fifth series
me bin here mine photography with them divide
is even photography
because that is naturally an picture the man using its camera not absorb may
anyway began my interests photography as ich mine erste digital received ages by yrs
ich combined mit mine ancients penchant drawing but was ein bit anders because use the cam was the trial rather the scheduling
and if man an pic mit one cam ending the trial if man to the trigger pushes
for mich seemed bei the photography so rather wherefore going location zur zeit his
ich believed every that
so wanted i somewhat other something in the the process starts when the triggers pushed will
photos like a along one lots roads
but hat an unexpected twist
and yet one realistic tier
or photos like these darkness and simultaneously but everyone with the joint goals a realistic layer retain
if i realities sage mine i
because course is she not somewhat das man really capture can but ich wants always appearance letting as they this coulda can at a photograph
photographs bei man one short moment reflection must the trick
goes so somewhat wherefore a idea as really one moment
what but is the trick the realistic looks lets
goes the details or the colors
goes the lighting
what the illusions
sometimes is the perspective the illusions
last but goes so how wir the world interpret and how she on one plot tangible made become can
goes not so what realistic is what wir for realistic hold
me faith so the bases are very simple
i she as ein puzzle the reality at the man various plays take and assemble may one alternate reality
and let you mich them one simple sample showing
us have here drei perfectly physical objects mit we us everybody identify can an globe
but an certain kind combines can you somewhat that always nor looks as exist could
but parallel knowing us that das not possibility is
we outwit so ours brain because ours brain accepted ganz simply not that not truly sense power
and me process combining of photographs
goes really only so various realities combine
the things so the an bild realistic appearance letting ich believe are the things about the we not ponder the things us around everyday
if wir but photographs combine is really important mindset because otherwise see she just kinda wrong out
me would so tell that three simple regulations obey admits a result reach
like you see can are that no three particular pictures
combined but can you somewhat special like das here
the first norm so that combined photographs prospect have should
secondly should combined photographs have
and this two pics fulfil these two demands from the altitude shot and the same
third goes therefore impossible do distinguishing the individual pictures start and ends man you seamless connects
makes impossible tell how the photo actually composed became
man so paint contrast and luminosity the the individual images photographic defects summed wie colour and disruptions blur we the borders between the different pics and letting you like one photograph appearance although a image fundamentally hundreds by tiers included may
here is an else sample
man mag thinkin that this only one is and the part manipulated was
image is but actuality complete assembled out photographs from different
ich personal that easier is one location als one venue finds because man must no compromising using the ideas his capita
but requires much scheduling
and as ich this idea winters had knew me that me multiple month you planning the various locations find for the tracks des puzzles
examples was the pisces on an admitted worden
this waterside originates from a others place
the originates from a quarries
and ich got even das home top to the island red looks letting
one result reaching expires by mir from watched so on design beyond
i always mit an sketch one idea
then goes the combinations the different pics
and here is each piece very fine planned
and when man then good footage makes can das result fairly beautiful his and also quite realistic
are so all tooling available and the single thing the uns is our imaginations
many thanks
i would myself with them gladly converse why many electronic fail
and me thinking that the main point is that us ceased have with our patient speeches
and the stuff the us the introduced have was an
goes you not specially scientifically pre you introduces an cup cafe or tee hin and asked the patients families relatives like goes
as can us helping
and we think we wanting think that the is why everybody might nur the most the electronic fail because us stopped have
that here is my an very simple thing
you hat an button out
and each mornings jumping me
and ich have a mission as you perhaps acknowledge
i have meine mission at
works quite simple any once when ich to the scales jump sends she meine dates also google
and there become they also by my retrieved so detect may mein lies and although not nur the moment the i assistance or too with an glance the history
gives but yet something
perhaps is them this known me have above followers on twitter
so each mornings jump ich at my and the people speeches already with mir before me car sitting lunch prefer only one little salat today lucien
but das is this what happen can because the is patients help because the could versus obesity utilized be or might patient this smoking
might but also uses becoming the humans aus their chairs wars and they bring jointly type games games her health better controlling
next week coming that at the markt
will small enter the man ein iphone oder
and becomes the humans allow from home their bp measuring ihn their medical sending and him with others share for something more als $
point coming the patients ins match they can not nur back the supervision assume capt on own vessel his can us even healthcare help the challenges the prior us lying and the des duplicate demand and continues
do they methodologies the easily using are and catching they mit this patients team hugging
and das can she thru such methods reach but also by crowdsourcing
and the things the wir done have wants i with them thru a videos share
us have alle ours automobiles
might even ours phone
wir knowing quite precisely all atm maastricht around
wir know nor one all stations lying
and sure we can finds
but would the nearest aed patients helping
wir have and nobody knew
noone knew the upcoming aed moment finding was
so what deeds us wir have crowdsourcing the netherlands carried
us have a webpage erected and one asked if you a aed see please divide she us mit is when at hat because sometimes is during closed naturally
and on became already the netherlands reported
the upcoming stride was the apps locate
and we have an designed
we have an app for developed enhanced reality these finds
and falls you an cities as maastricht are and somebody collapsing can she your iphone using and inside the next weekly even your the next aed find the lifestyle saving may
and today want wir not only als like das product also als introduce
and wir want on one global tier bring
and us pleas ours colleagues to the whole world from other colleges therefore us help as hubs behavior this to the entire world
and if they vacation are and someone collapsing sei its own kin or someone anders can you an aed finding
das other ding wir beg want is that corporates to the entire world us in the confirm this helping
this could be oder technician sample nur that the reported aed allways nor its body
plz helping they us and trying they the health not nur something improving the palm take
many thanks
today will me from unexpected discovery reports
me the
and mein small startup wants that we uns environment forcing
the crowdsourcing attention gives
here is ein video above das what wir tun
a moment
lasts might until loaded is
well us can this just skipping me will instead just das videos skipping
nope
that is not
ok
is
meine period is already over
ok many thanks
so front one pair yrs have i an programs initiated the stars technique and design get one year break take and an environment work the fairly anything what she actually hating we have they the government work let
das programm code and is an bit like this for
us select any year some fellows from and us let she using works
instead she the third globe send send wir they
and there developed you apps using urban
but what you really doing is reveal what today mit tech possibility is
so meetings she
is a the city boston
here sees aus as to an seeks but what really addiction is anybody the him when is coz knows is not very fine the fires when of an metre snow is
as came at this particular kind after assistance search
we had last year an team of fellows boston this code
you wares there feb and hat last feb lot
and she that the town nie these hydrant vacant
but one fellow one husband named erik noted still slightly other and das was that the inhabitants the frei directly prior these split
so did what everybody good developers do dignity wrote an app
is a kleine app man one hydrant adopting can
ihn free shovels when snowing
when this can he one name give and the first
when das not can ihn dir someone
so is a small
is an modest small app
is probably the tiniest the apps the the fellows last year wrote have
but she toot somewhat what none other toot
they out
is this chap the department the town honolulu the seen has that this app using could not for snow so the citizen adopting
is very important that this functioning but the guys steal the battery
gotten the citizen she verify
and then seattle the app use the citizen getting the clean
and chicago hat you just instituted so the folk the when snowing
wir know now niner towns the plan this app benefits
and they hat smoothly disseminated organically course
if something about that typically not expires
the procure of software lasts the norm one pairs year
wir had a team that last year an project boston cooperated for the drei folk months
walked one methodology with the parents can what the public colleges for its children are
us was later narrated that when over the normal canals walk dignity on two yrs woulda and coulda over two million $ tasted
and das is nor gar nothin
admits currently an projekt the californian justice das the taxpayers previously two billions dollar tasted hat and works not
and is projects how at everybody tier the gov
so an app the ein pair days written is and then by is an type shot before the bug at the institution the government
she show as the gov better works might not more wie a businesses as many people think that they should
and not once how ein rather how das internet yourself
and this meaning free access the signifies open and productive
and das is important
but important this app is that they one new generation represents the the trouble the government not als the trouble one institution als ein problem des collective
and this is a very good because show that wir very good are collective acting mit tech
now returns one large commune by the the tools the we needing stuff effective together
is not just code fellows returns hundreds by people whole lands the and write any day their own towns
you have the gov not forsaken
she she are dreadful frustration with your but you complaining not you repair she
and these folk know somewhat what we from the eyes lost have
and that is then if everyone your feeling above politics and the serpent and all the other stuff forgetting over the wir uns really upsetting is cabinet kern the words of tintin reilly what we shared doing this us not alone doing can
today hat one quantity folks the cabinet abandoned
and when one human please me you that cuz the stuff modify
the policy not the cabinet is
and coz the cabinet ultimately her strength from us dich us that folk how us thinking will influence wie this happens
i knew not very lot above cabinet als me program launched
and like many folks thought me that in the government chiefly so goes people an office select
well to two years am ich the came that front everything at communes goes
this is that for service and information
there typically out if yours cities
when ever the chance have working as ours fellow scott silverman als part des the deed do they das alle see that the peeps the government because different trouble calling incl that an house
scott gets so these
the official databank
and has not realy a idea captures mit the
and lastly says look she can you just alle doors home open and very noisy musik playing and see das cattle
and that functioned applause for scott
but das was not this end the
boston has not nur a
hat one app an and named connect
we have these app not written
that is the work very folks bureau the urban boston
day this is a actual report came purely my dumpster can not saying you dead is
like gettin me she removed
but what mit connect happened is anders
scott entertained of human gosh
but to connect is anything publicly that everybody see can
and case watched one neighbour
and the next entry the we getting have i went there found the dumpster behind the home
alive yap
turned the dumpster to the side walked to
good nighttime sweetheart
quite just
the is great here meets the digital das physical
and is too ein good examples like the cabinet the crowdsourcing getting is
but is even ein sample the government als platform
and i my here not necessarily an technical defining the platforms
ich sooner about an platform for people self help and other help
a citizen half an other citizens but the gov played here a centralized scroll
she federation these both people
and man woulda they she using governmental benefits merge can when these needs worden but a neighbour is one far better and cheaper alternate governmental services
if a neighbor the others helping strengthen us ours towns
summon us the one quantity money
the main things is that we think must is that government not same is like policy
and the most human understanding the but she belive the an be the input des others
that unser contribution systems the choose is
how frequently have us a political führer selected and sometimes have us an crowds energie consumed one new political guides dial and then reclining we uns back and we expecting that the gov ours values reflecting and our needs fulfilled and then has not lot altered
the is because the cabinet like a continued oceanic is and politics the are the supreme
and what below is is the what we bureaucracies calling
and us using word mit such scorn
but is these scorn the these thing the we owning and for the us paying slightly sein lets that vs us works slightly other and then us uns self
the folk seem think policy is sexy
when we wanna that this institution for uns works must wir bureaucratic sexy make
coz the is the
we must us at the the cabinet
so the hat done
ihr this guys watched
is one group citizens the a very report written hat the one reply on this via the zur is
the is not politically activ his that is bureaucracy proactive his
now for from uns the the government discontinued have is time that wir ponder about the world the we ours childrens leave wanting
you the enormous challenges introduce they posts must
faith wir truly that we reaching what us reach must without the one institution improving the names by uns allen acting can
a government is totally required but the must becoming
the good message is that tech possibility makes the feature the cabinet fundamental an wise the actual something reach can you the society reinforces
and is a generation gives the internet raised is and the know that not heavy is things together tun man must the just correct systems building
well that ours fellows is so bin i sorry almost one generation elderly als the most of them
is one generation the so raised is its voice als naturally see
they struggle not these clash the us everybody fight wherefore whos speaking may you everyone speak
she can its opinion on each channel each zeit and she doing
so when you with the trouble the cabinet confronts become you not very therefore yours voices using
they using their hands
you use their hands apps write the the labor the gov improved
and this apps letting us ours hands use ours congregations improve
that might be one hydrant weed one dustbin using an
and certainly shoulda we these this hydrant the whole zeit can and lots human tun this
but these apps are as kleine digital alarms that wir not just consumers are and wir not nur consumers the government are the taxation paying and performances receiving
us are more as this wir are citizen
and we becoming the gov not improving up us the citizenship improve
so the question the me for all here have when the big important stuff goes the we together do must alle together will wir only an quantity from voices sein oder become we too a quantity of hands sein
thank
typically insists mine scroll herein the explain how wonderful the new technologies what emergence are his become and i thought mir ich here unter friends bin dignity me narrate what i realy think and also trying return look and understanding what here realy pre goes with these incredible after front what swift happened that wir scarcely can
i will so start kurz a sole foil showing
please briefly the foil showing
das is one foil which ich random from my folders chosen got
goes mir here not the details the slide rather the form
this slide displays dates one analytics from us above the power by risc processors compared mit the power
das interesting here is that this slide wie others which wir often field an kind just on one curve are
with others words every crotch here complies an potency the
and that is a novelty that us these type scale on curved area the tech use must
slightly very happens here
is essentials that ich here speaking become
so if please this lights reunited
yet something brighter weil i become equals something to this paper here drawing
now why draw us the technology to bends
the reason is if me to a normal curve draw would say us that here the year are so the an kind and that here is an the tech which i mit an constitute wants then will the graph foolish
the see then from
and this said us not lots
when i well one others tech recording want tell we mal a then would the to the scale very irrational mould one shallow lineage
but when something like here happens then the qualitative circumstance
when so the fast as the progression would then could wir ein cab boarding and seconds we tokyo
but the goes not quickly
das gab yet nie previously the history the this kind from growth thru which the all few year exponential increased
the ask the ich well posts wants is if man these curve sees man she going not for allways continued
is not possible that all for allways and eternally quickly wie now
gives two options
either becomes one classical wie here up somewhat totally neues or becomes das here happened
this is approx
well ich bin optimist so think me something the type how here is happen
is the truly then means this we are here moment a transition
we are here at this line a transition from the globe an new type from world
the ask the ich so pose wants and ich mir even often yourself place is wie these new globe arguably his is
what is this new state the the globe slow
because the transition appears very very puzzling his if man
as me yet ein child was was the future someplace year and the folks languages frequently what arguably happen dignity year
now have we here one conference the folk on the futures speaking and man introduces feast that the future allways still year lies
continuing als das walk we not
other words so is the futures any year ein year shrank since i at this world bin
i think the cause is that wir remember that slightly is
the transition happens us can everybody feel
and we know that currently simple meaning makes trying or yrs the future look weil all anders sein becomes that an simple from the what we now do meaning power
ich wants now talk what the his might this transition the we uns currently
make will ich first over some other stuff speak what truly nothing with tech oder computers tun have
because me belive really understand can must we an step return going and uns the thing on an longer watch
and admittedly wants ich at the des life the soil watch
ich belief the sense if man some subdivided
going we so return and admittedly billions year the earth was an with many chemicals
when man well the type and wise viewed like this chemical organized commodities then admits uns das ein quite good picture like they that
me faith too returns theories the understand commence as all with rna started hat but me become a simplified story narrate what that this zeit small what assorted types by recipes for chemical contained
some this contained an particular combination from chemicals which them allowed others chemicals of outer integrate and therefore grow
alle the wares began
this small wares senses the
but merchandise these not approx vivid todays senses because every single was only a small recipe of chemical
and every mal if shared have the herein chemical unequal quantity distributed
hence was any droplets ein little anders
actual the droplets which a for the growth composition had quick als other and integrated more and more chemical of outside and swift
this so longer surviving and she propagated extent
das is so only a very easy chemicals shape from lifestyle but interesting becomes when this droplets one trick over abstraction
to one type what wir still not ganz comprehend have this droplets the ability learns info
you have learnt this prescription the cells as information save and admittedly an certain form what wir dna calling
using other words have they this evolutionary kind a path discovered the them allowed she insisted that these information saved and copied will could
this amazing is that these type informations saving about the period of billion yrs the she arose is same remained
indeed insists this prescription for uns namely our gene from the exactly code and the equal spelling
and although every creatures uses the exactly same letters and code
us are that we just yourself thing code writing can
and me got here microgram which me airport fern of keep trials
therein what me made got is me got these code taken the code consists aus ordinary letters what wir symbolize using and i have meine card on an play dna wrote and have mal intensified
when so anyone hundred million copies my card wants i have enough for anyone space and even for everybody to this globe and is exact here
would me reality ein then would ich they at ein virus posted and the space released
what is so the upcoming stride
das the dna was a interesting step
and that these cells this made they happy for a more billions year
but then happened a very interesting step bei the the stuff complete anders were namely began this cells communicating and informations that communities by cells originated
ich white not you the already knew but bacteria can actual her dna exchange
the is also the grund why examples the consistency antibiotic growing
some bacteria have discovered as she by penicillin can and have these information together with others bacterial the dna wrote and now have wir any volume bacterial what resistant on penicillin are cuz the bacterial communicating
these communication allowed now that reasons of communities what senses boat wares she were
thus have she either together surviving oder you went together at this signified that if an community successfully was were everyone individuals the community repeated and from the evolution preferably
the is now there these community nearby that you resolute this prescription for the entire fellowship one string at the dna writing
and the upcoming interesting phases lasted roughly one more billion yrs
date have we community community by many what together als organisms
the did are we too an such community
we have many cells what not more at solo posed are
your are useless excl and continuing
this community began so that the level at which the evolution not longer the single cell was the whole which us organisms calling
the nearest crotch happened well within this communities
the began again info
and you evolved special structure which nothin other as info within des organisms
and are the structures
the are so the the this constructed have
they specialists inside the fellowship special structures what responsible were for das learning understanding and das hold from information
and was das brains and that nervous this community
gave them an evolutionary perk
weil timing one individual learn happened well within the interval the lifetime individual organisms instead above these timeframe
a organisms could so sample learning an certain fruits not eating coz you poorly and ihn sick made that final times as you eaten has
couldn well within the durability individual organisms happening before hundreds from yrs used were weil this information learned be by the individuals what because this fruits these nor not available were
das nervous hat so the this because the evolution couldn now inside
she couldn within temporal
what then happened is that the organisms a gone found communicate
once as examples the us known version this is the human languages
is yet an right invented when man
i have here a very complicated and idea my capita
me seats here and give taken sounds from mir the hoping so one similar idea heads the an certain similarities using mine original idea hat
us take so something very transform sounds an sequence from tones and producing so something very the heads of others
permitted us now so back as a unified organism functioning
and what we indeed done have wir the humankind is we have begun
wir stairs which have the abstraction our methodologies as wir dates hold showcasing
the fiction the language was an lesser step these direction
telephony computing and continuing are everything ours specialized mechanism the us ours community built have these informations manage can
and connects uns alle together somewhat that much bigger is and too able is faster continuing evolving als we previously wares
nowadays can so evolution the timeframe from microseconds happening
her also small viewed ein bit evolution programs shown hat straight before eyes
well have we so the again
the first steps the story which me tells have lasted one billion year pro play
the next strides like the nervous and the brain lasted some hundreds million yrs
then the footsteps how language and further lasted fewer as one millions years
and these next footsteps like electronic seeming only few decades
the process fed of self and is thus ich believe is das word when slightly seine amplified
more quick
and i belief that is das what us here see this curve
we see the trial the by self fed
i live professionally of build from computers and i white that i the mechanisms the me computers construct not use might without the recent progress the
meine latest activity insists herein objects with one hoher complexity that impossible for myself is this traditional meaning
i weiss not what everybody single transistor the power
has billions by
what ich instead make and what even the designers of making is us thinking on an conscience surrendered this the machines and the machinery power slightly the our skill far exceeds better and faster als we yourself ever make could
and they power part mit methodology which we bis now not once correct comprehend
an methodology what particular interesting is and what i last period frequent utilized have is the evolution yourself
installing wir an the machinery which
one examples calling the cases can we ein programm create which from instructions evolved
us say computing plz hundred millions accidental selected sequences by instruction
now pls alle this accidental elected instructions aus all programs from and pick what mine presets next are
so others words ich first what me will
saying we mal me want numbers sort that would an simple example which i already uses have
find so programmes what numbers sort can
course is the chance in accidental elected instructions very small that they via accident just numbers sort so becoming probably no the instruction actual do
but a from mag using slightly happiness two numbers the ordering back
now sage ich computing take now the sequences what my presets next came are
save these delete the rest
now all the the numbers best sort have
and admittedly mit one method des analogue zur reproduction
take two programmes and she producing childs thru the exchange their and the childs the characteristics the by the two programs
well have ich so a neue generation of programs the thru ensembles by programs emerged which somewhat nearer the defaults came are als other
tell plz repeat these process
you back
maybe some mutations one
and attempt this whole again with an other generation
all these generational need only few milliseconds
and may ich one evolution about millions of years computer within less min traverse let oder cases some hrs
get ich programmes the numbers perfectly sorting can
fact is this programmes are lots as any programs this ich of hand write would can
when i me then this programmes then can ich not saying like she functioning
ich got tries they comprehension
are and programmes
but she the job
me weiss and am me quite sure that they the job coz you out an row by programs coming what the job done have
because you lifestyle hung they the job right
me sass once an together mit marvin minsky ale an map and say look look you that
stands aircraft consists aus which together working their flights safer making makes dich this not
us know that one not optimally is if complicated becomes
so begin wir us at computers exit for a trial which of classical stark differentiates
allowed us things using an lot higher complexity as the normal methodologies enable would produce
and however understanding we the options nor not ganz
us the engineering so
wir using these programs now the computing much quick make that we able are this lawsuits yet faster executing can
arises so an
is quick and faster and i belive the is the reason why confusing shines
because all this new technologies from today from yourself
us lift
wir are a item the analogy is then as develops have
we are so the and wir can nor not ganz what zur hellfire we here actually are
we are
but i belief really that after uns still somewhat coming
i find very arrogant by us say that us the the evolution are
and i believe we everyone here are part the creation by the what even always as next coming
now this lunches stands before and i thinkin me listen here now at before ich still become
meine history begins exact here rajasthan before about two yrs
me was under the starry the desert together with ali
us languages that nothing altered has since the time des indian epic mahabharata
if we indians then traveling us one wagons and on the heavens
now make we this using aeroplanes
then as the large indian arjuna thirst had took an bow lap the boden and waters stepped
now make we das using and machines
us came the conclusions that charm and magic by machines replace became
that made mich realy sad
me gotten something scared prior technology
made mir anxiety that ich the ability loses might the sundown enjoy can without camera and excl tweet mine friend
me found that technology magic possible making should and not slaying
als me an small girlie was gave my grandfather me its small silver
slice years old tech was das thing for myself
they became ein golden accessibility an world crowded raiders and vessel and pictures my presentation
mir came pre als uns ours fancy clocks and camera dreams
you us inspired becoming
and i myself the world the tech see like me she use might magic enable instead slaying
with commenced me books illustrate
as ich das ipad seen saw i als apparatus the reader at the entire globe connect may
can knowing as we holding
may know we are

many thanks
is realy a extraordinary honor for myself
me spend the bulk my period mit humans custody jails or
me spend the bulk mine time using the socially weakest the and very much hopelessness is
here at ted be see and hear as that is hat mir very much strength given
the short zeit here was mir sure ted has an identity
man can here stuff say the global influence have
and sometimes if somewhat above ted arrives gets an importance and force the otherwise not woulda
ich sage that coz me faith that identity very important is
we have some fantastic presentation watched
ich belief that we learnt have that the words meaning have but the the words dedicated especially are
as doctors can man good tun as doctor but can man still more doing
and therefore wants ich via the power the identities speak
i got das incidentally not my labor als counsel learned
me have das from mine grandma learned
me was tall an familie an traditional household the of one dominates was and this was my grandma
they was one strong woman she had effect
you had that latest word everyone
she was too the litigation our fam
she was the daughter an
your parents became the virginia as slave born
she was born and the experiences the slavery you very strong
meine granny was stark but you was even fondly
if me she as kleiner young met came she at me and myself
you squeezed me feast that ich hardly breathe could then you myself los
an or two hour later if ich ihr came she to myself and said bryan still mine hug
and when ich nope said she myself back when i said she me silence
you was somewhat this made that man allways yours near be wished
das sole problem was that she ten kinder had
my mother was the youngest your ten childrens
sometimes when me time using you spend wanted was difficult its attention erlangen
my cousins everywhere around
ich remind mich ich must eight or neun be that me mornings and ins lounge went everybody mine cousins around
my granny sat ending des and myself
first thought me that this an match would
ich saw she and but you beheld very serious out
this went oder mins then stand they to and kam me they took me at the palm and told come bryan and i we must talk
i remind me nor als yesterday was
i become never forgotten
you took mich mit to outdoors and said bryan ich become dir slightly recount but pledge that not
i said promised grandmother
she told ich said
you mich hin and beheld myself she told i wants that that me dich observed got
you told i believe something special
she said ich belief can anything do what tun
ich become that nie forget
then told she mir nur drei stuff promises bryan
i told granny
she said as mir that yours mommy always loved
they told yours mommy is my baby and mit pledge that dich always you
me revered mine mum so told ich granny that will me do
then told they als next mir that always the doing also if hard falls that do
ich thought to and told oma me
eventually told they das latest what me pledge is that never booze drink
now i was nine years old and said i grandmother ich
ich grew at the country to alte rural south and ich have one bro the one year older is and a an year younger nurse
als me about oder was kam day mein bro after and brought beer with my sister and myself and walked with uns the woodland
we there just around like else even
then took one swallow beer and bot my sis and she took and then porters she mir one
i told nope nope no already power you only ich will no beers
my bro said well mach already today make wir the yet also else anything what wir tun
i had what your nurse had what los drink ein beers
i told ich will not power her nur power ihr nur
my brother me
said what is because los mit you now drinking but what
then beheld mir ins face and said no you yet not allways yet mad because the entertainment using grandma
ich told
said oma narrated allen that you what special are
ich was soil destroyed
ich will them slightly confessing
ich should this probable not doing
the here is maybe publicly transfer
ich bin years old and me confess that me still never a drops liquor drank got
i saga the not weil i ich belief that is i saga the cuz identity makes means
when us the type by identities creating can we the humans uns around stuff tell the they not belive
wir can you get things doing from she you could not
course would meine grandma all their tell you slightly special
my grandpa was during the jail
mine uncles diseases
and she believed that the themes the us us
me got attempted something on unser saying
country is anders as prior yrs
commodities humans prisons and prison
today are million
the united countries have today the tallest the world
sieben million humans are on parole sacked or with
mine opinions to have ours globe fundamental changed
socially weak and blacks divide the demography reign desperate and hopelessness due this modifications
an of threes male black between and is incarceration imprisonment at paroled dismissed oder using
urban towns anywhere lands from los angeles about philadelphia baltimore until washington are to percentage aller blacks boys male either detention imprisonment to parole fired oder using
ours system is but not only moulded thru questions the mit do have becomes too by poverty disfigured
we have land one das you lot better treats when you realm and guilty are als poor and innocent
assets not fault influences das earnings
nevertheless shining wir so ganz happy be
a politics aus anxiety and zorn has us convinced that this trouble not ours issues are
we have the contacts lost
me find that interesting
gives a pair trends
mein alabama them permanent that suffrage if you criminally condemned will
here and today alabama have % the male black demography durable your suffrage lost
we that zehn yrs the quota the the bourgeois up his is like front the adoption des
the silence is
i kids
lots my clients are very young
the united states of america are that sole land the world that childs death prisons sentenced
land is for kids imprisonment excl conditional
we have already a crowds procedures run
this single land the globe
ich people
the question the penalty is one interesting question
we belive coz man uns taught has that the ask the is hat an human earned for one from he felony perish
this is a very sensitive question
man may but also anders thinking addicted like us ours identities see
the other is not hat someone for one offences the deaths merit have we merit slay
me find the fascinating
the penalty america defined through error
to nine people the us executed have coming one the us for innocent have the relieving and out the fired became
a amazing an from neun innocence
ich find this fascinating
wir would ever someone mit a aeroplane flies let if for neun planes the takeoff crashing
but kinda creating wir uns by problem
is not unser problem
is not our burden
is not unser battle
i speech lots about these ask
i speech via breed and the question we das law have slaying
and is exciting cuz ich my history i speech above slavery
me speech on terrorist the period oppose finish the reconstructing until hin commencement des
wir knowing not truly very lots
but for the land was an period des
many humans fear front have
or front bomb
was the angst prior terror the you living
this elders people coming now mir and say stevenson you talk she keeping lectures they saying the humans that she cease should say that we first once the story our nation mit terrorism doing have to the sept
they saying nope say you the humans that wir so raised are
and after the terrorism came naturally the and decades the racially motivated subjection and apartheid
and however returns lands an dynamism wir speaking not gladly above ours troubles
we speaking not happy above ours history
and hence understand we not realy what relevance our deeds historic context have
we bumping continuously successive
us creating allways neue stresses and conflict
falling us difficult about breed speaking and i belive the lies that us not willing are us the trial the truth and reconciliation nearing
pretoria have the people understand that the not transcend is excl the readiness truth and reconcile
myself to the genocide rwanda gab these readiness but not ours lands
i got some presentations germany about the death held
was fascinating because one the researcher stood to my presentation on and said knowledge she is profoundly you speeches listening
told germany gives no penalty
and naturally can they germany nie more enter
became quite hush then told a wife mit our story is impossible that we us ever again for this systematic killing from human pronounce
would of us conscious and purposefully people
i thought to
as dignity an globe leben the the german government human execute especially if beneath disproportionately many jews
would intolerable
would
and yet here lands the states des old straightening us people hin here is this risk death sentenced becoming elf mal higher if this sacrifice caucasian is as if schwarz is mal higher when the defendants black is and das victim caucasian whose earth the body humans resting
and nevertheless admits this mental
i belief ours identities is threatened
when us uns not so with these theme then are the positive and likewise afflicted
we loving innovation
wir loved tech and creative
us love entertainment
but will this realities marred by suffering misuse exclusion
mir appears important both unite
because wir talking ultimately that us more hope need more engagement more surrender one globe existence can
for myself means this zeit and speeches above the arms the underprivileged the the never at ted sein becoming
but thinking at a kind and way the our own lifestyle integrated is
we everyone must last things belive the we not see can
we doing das rationally wir too are very wir intellect estimation
innovating creativity and development coming not nur out ours heads
you come out ideas the driven be through the conviction ours hearts
is these by the ich belief that she us not only openly be for all the and stuff too for the and
vaclav havel the large czech politics has once told
as we eastern oppose the repression fought we all possible but what we most was hoping one mental orientation the standby sometimes his and witness be
this mental orientation is the core whose me faith that even the must
admits none delimitation tech and design the us allowed ganz and gar humane sein we not too eyes and ears have for poverty marginalisation and injustice
ich wants they warn these type of identity urges very lot more of us als when we us not wherefore
they becomes you deeply touching
as attorney ich the large privilege rosa parks meet
ms parks kam allways back once return to montgomery you two their elder friends this elders female johnnie carr the the organized had a incredible and virginia an whites theirs hubby clifford king represented
this womens so and entertained easy
and called wife carr myself then and told bryan wife parks arrives the town wir wanna uns converse
wanna they and listening
and i told very gladly
you said and what be you tun when you here are
ich said ich will listening
and i walked and overheard simple only
was always inspiring
day sat i there and listened these womens and after a pairs hrs spun wife parks mir us said well bryan tell she mir what the initiative for right is
what trying they reach
i commenced using my usual speech
i said us trying vs unfairness
wanting humans help the innocence convicted were
we wanna and discrimination fighting
us wanting imprisonment excl conditional for childrens abolition
us want something vs the penalty company
we wanting the number the detainees reduce
us wanting abolish
ich held my usual speech and after beheld she me and told
you said das is they very very weary making
then leaned ms carr pre mir laid a fingers to my face and said and therefore must she very very brave sein
and therefore believe me that the braver be should
us must ways uns these challenges posts these problems sorrow
because ultimately hangs ours humanity by ours aller humanity
mine labor have me ganz simple things learnt
me got an pairs ganz simple stuff learned
that wir everybody more are as that worst what we ever done have
ich believe das applies for every human to the planet
when someone is not only easy an liar
if anybody slightly takes that he not owned is not only a thief
self whos somebody kills is not just an killer
and coz this is admits a fundamental human dignity the this iaw respect must
i belive too that many divide landes and mit safety many share the earth das opposite from poverty not wealth is
me belive the not
ich belief that many this opposite by poverty fairness is
and lastly believe i that though they dramatic is nice and inspiring and us finish not our technology measured becoming not the the we evolve not intellect and sanity
becomes one company not measured how she their rich and mighty and privileged treats how she using the poor bypasses the condemned the detainees
because contexts start us the truly astonishing things understanding the us
sometimes me this balance a story
sometimes me very
me will weary how us alle
sometimes ellen these thoughts mindset advance on quite important kind and wise
me this kids the very hard fines convicted became
me go ins and visit a client the oder years alt be mag and the as adult pre court stand should
then ask ich myself as could this happen
as may one richter somebody something transform das not is
the richter viewed him as adults but me an child
night stayed i lange at and thought my kindness if a judges uns something else turning can then must have
exactly bryan the richter has
you too what wishing
and weil late was and me not more correct think couldn ich a motion working
i had a poor blacks boys as clients
and i using complaint the headline motion my arms blacks client as an privileged white treat
my request explained me that misconduct the prosecution and the police and
gave a crazy row that land nothing more is that only yet wrongdoing admits
next morgen woke me on and knew not more me these lunatics motion just dreamt or ihn actually posted had
and my horror had me ihn not just wrote also ans dish sent
ein few months went and me had just all oblivion
eventually but opted ich me mein god ich must ins courtroom and these crazies fall recite
i climbed ins car and was realy overcome overwhelmed
ich drove so court
and me thought the is tough painful
lastly rose ich aus my car and went the steps dish up
as i the stair courts was one older blacks mann the concierge court
as me watched kam me and told whos are you
me said me am attorney told you are attorney i told
kam mir and myself
then mir ins ear
told i bin pride on you
and me must tell gab mir kraft
touched something ganz deep me identity the capability each individual somewhat one community one perspective the hope
now ich the courtroom
once the judges mich beheld
told herr stevenson have she these lunatics motion posed
ich told and then wir debating
always more humans came simple coz they rage wares
that me these lunatics things written had
came and deputy prosecutors and
was the courtroom full human the anger wares that we about skin language on poverty about inequality
from my beheld ich the janitor at and going
saw always again through this window and could this whole hear
went on and
eventually came this elders blacks man with a very the courtroom and straight behind mich nearly to the
zehn minutes later announced the judges one break
during the pause came an the that the janitor courtroom was
this deputy the elderly black
said jimmy what make they courtroom
the elder blacks mann stood on beheld the deputy then beheld me and told i bin young man saying lose she that goal not out the eye enter you not at
me am zur ted came cuz me believe that many of them roger have that das moral pendulum des universe far but that the equity
that we als human not fully developed are wir us not and
that our aller survive using the survival any individual linked is
that wir our vision from technology and design from conversation and creativity connect must mit humanity mercy and justice
and prior everything wants ich of them the the likewise see simple only tell lose they that objective not from the eye give you not to
they have bei audiences this community one obvious wish saw and listened them helping and somewhat do
what can us yet doing
bryan stevenson now returns everywhere opportunities
when they california living is springtime a bei the so goes indeed one exertion company somewhat of the the else the policy the punishment flows
here california sample is man the next five years a billions dollars for the death one billions dollar
and anyway endings aller not mit an arrests
aller coming not before courts
here is the chance somewhat do
referendum will suggest das cash more and safety invest
me belief anywhere admits options
while the last three decades is the america immense sunk
this fact will often one context mit the posed
what would you someone saying the this believe
well indeed has the integer the not very changed
the bulk the land found not really the classroom the stead
was the crusade against narcotic
hence come the dramatic hoher figures at the
us have uns let from the rhetoric the punish
now have wir the human for always behind mesh bring for one for the larceny good instead that man she the stuff the victims
i believe wir must more doing human help the casualties an offences became are not less
and me belief that ours nobody assists
me believe this is what we modify must
bryan she have here truly one swing brought
you are one personalities
thank that they at ted goods many thanks

my gosh
so this are nur ein few the clips the me about the last sechs months collected have shoulda but also the last six days sein can oder the last sechs yrs
fact is that the media prefer uns negative topics showing coz ours sanity precisely these themes alertness donates
and gives also an very good grund
each sec each day catching our meaning lots more info at as our brain ever may
and weil uns nothin important is as unser survive is the first for all the informations a part ours the amygdala
the amygdala is so unser ours
sorts and the information to the searching after from risk our environs
if we so the message see prefers we to negatives news lookout hold
and that ancient adage if bleeding climbs the demand is very true
well using all our digital the us sieben day the weekly hour day all this negative messages is no wonder that wir pessimistic are
is no wonder that everyone thinks that the world always worse goes
but maybe is not the fall
possibly is that the actuality
perhaps accelerating the tremendous progress the we last century thru a series from made have strong that uns the next drei decades possible is an globe des created
now i sage not that us none major issues have and the have us already
and als human are we lot better herein issues to very long viewpoint but you yet overcome
see wir uns yet once what us last jahrhundert reached have so we the evolution foresee can
the last yrs hat the average longevity more als doubles the the inflationary adapted the has tripled
has ein tenths decreases
comes that the and one multiples decreases have
steve pinker has us shown that wir currently an very peaceful zeit the leben
and noisy charles kenny is the the years by at risen
wir leben one really extraordinary time
and many people forgotten
and wir boost our expectation constantly continues
actually have us poverty neu defines
concern they that a large percentage the americans the at the lifestyle access strom water toilet tv conditioners and automobiles have
the richest capitalists des last jahrhunderts the the earth shoulda ever such can
the groundwork for many forming technologies and these growing
my good boyfriend ray kurzweil hat us shown that every tool this zur becomes on the curve of moores law große jumps power and the alle bis months doubles
wherefore this your bag circa a million mal less and is quick als an supercomputer from the
now look she these curve
das is moores law the last hundred years
heed she two things this curve
firstly as supple you good like bad periods war or truce recession depression and
das is that result by faster computers the quicker computing build
they slows for none our large issues
besides spite hers on the left site they upwards
the growth itself accelerating so
and to this curve to the backs of moores act find we an series technologies the allen zur injunction standing
something das mine friend at autodesk call sensors and network robotic the allow the personal production on planets synthetic biology propellant vaccination and dietary digital medication and artificial intelligence
how many from them have the victory from supercomputer watson in risks watched
das was yet grandiose
ich got times the newspaper and to the best headline searched the i find couldn
me love this watson human opponent
risks is not simple game
goes so the nuances the languages understand
pose she mal before that this artificial intellect everyone owners zur disposition
before four yrs ray kurzweil and me here in ted an neue university the
we bringing our student all these technology in using focus as these utilized will can the big challenges the humanity solving
and each year beg we the students businesses products and services creating the within positivity this living from of people can
mindset you to that one gruppe from undergraduates today the leben of billion of human influencing may
before years would ludicrous consulted
today can us to dozens of business refer the exact made have
if me thinkin abundance creating then meine i not ein live filled luxurious for any on planets goes mir so ein leben filled possibilities creating
goes therefore from squire abundance creating
shortage is namely and tech is a ressources force
here is ein examples
is the story of napoleon the mid des jahrhunderts
is the typ links
has the king of siamese supper invites
napoleon soldiers napoléon even gotten
the king from siamese however gotten
aluminum was this time that metallic on the planet valuable als gold and platinum
is the reason why the dome des from aluminum crafted became
though aluminum percentage the coming not als metal pre
becomes through oxygen and connected
but then was the tech the electrolysis evolved and made cheap that we mit ours utility
then uns these analogy mal the futures
wir think today
meine ladies and gents we living at an planet the mit more energy filled is as us annual consume
energy alle minutes at the
not scarcity this trouble is accessibility
and is good news
year hat man first times succeeded the expenses for india % des reducing rupees comparing rupees
the cost for solar fell last year percent
last month hat the using an study published the shows that up end the sunny the usa solar dime per kwh comparison cent national averages cost becomes
and if us an have then become wir also water abundance have
speak we via
reminder they als karl sagan this as saturn was return direction soil rotated
took one photo at like
blue dot
because us on a living
we life at an planet the % using water covered is
are % saltwater % are and we fight percentage des on the planets but here gives also hopeful
and returns neue technology not oder years now
are new to the path
and out an talk today morning mit dean kaman an the des wants ich something mit them share gab mir the permission seine the and from the lots from them perhaps already owns have hat the height
may thousand liter potable per day aus various sources creating salt waters latrine and all the for fewer als dime per litres
the chairman of hat straight one big using hundert units startup
and if alles well runs and i bin very confident then becomes this tech global countries to the entire planets apply
is innovation the today returns
and wir have even at spotted
meine goodness we reaching bald the percent from up ends of
misgivings you nur that one with a handy the centre from nairobi an better hat as presidents reagan front years
and if you with smartphone on google searches have you more gateway know and informations as presidents clinton front yrs
you living one world the info and communication abundance hat wie noone ever woulda predictions can
and arrives nor better the stuff for the she and me multiple tausend $ issued have gps and photo libraries full books and music tech zur diagnosis be well literally and cheaper handy
and that finest is possibly what uns section health awaited
last monthly had me das pleasure mit the the referred millions qualcomm
we demanding teams to the entire globe all this technologies an merge that man with the apparatus speak may mit equipped is man may oder his testing
and winning must this apparatus a better diagnostic pose as one team physicians
posts she appliance front a no doctors gives however percent the and percent the staff des
when appliance an or sequenced the not known is calls the and prevents an pandemic before breakout
but now zur greatest strength the uns one globe des lead becomes
ich they the forthcoming billion
the white line stand for demographics
us have straight the exceeded
and nur the greatest hedging against one is an better parenting and dietary the whole world
had wir just at two billion human online attached
pending rise wir expected of two to fünf billion
drei billions neue minds from wir never formerly owned have become the global communications plug
what needing this people
what be they consuming what will she desire
and instead from stagnation ich one the largest economic the history
this human represent multiple $ the the global economy flow become
and you will by the usage des healthier becoming and she become better educated by the and thereby that they the possibility have become and computing and lot productive his as ever before
so what can billions increasing wholesome productive members the uns bringing
wie would using an typesetting newer nie before voting
as would so the suppressed also allways she are one agree enter at attentive making and change generating times
what becoming these three billions humans bring
wie would with the wir not once forecasting can
the things the i through the learnt have is that small teams the thru passion and focus motivation are exceptional stuff creating can things the große business and governmental just the past creating couldn
i wants using one history the me truly delighted has
gives one programme the some perhaps already know
is a gameplay that
was the university by washington seattle developed
and is a games the people a sequence from amino take can exploration wie that protein develop becomes
after his behavioural can we the structure and functions predictions
and is very important the
hitherto was one trouble for supercomputer
and play was by played
and are meantime hundreds of thousands by people the das games online played have
and revealed that nowadays the human better the protein als the best supercomputer
and als this individuals came and whos the finest the world is was not even no was someone out england manchester an wife the daytime as assistant the management an worked and night the best the globe was
my ladies and lords what mir trust our futures is is the fact that we today more power als individuals have uns the big challenges ours planet posts
wir have access at utilities mit technology
we have the passion
us have that capital the
and us have three billion new minds mit wir online works can the new challenges mastering and that doing what neccessary is
wir expect ein pairs extraordinary decades
thank beautiful
me believe that we slightly against one slice culture business must
and me faith that using an physicians begins and the bin ich
and might am i already long enough transaction as that ich me enable may an pieces own false enable
before ich however issue come let you us with an little baseball begin
hey why not
we are the near and move uns to the
we all loved baseball oder
baseball is crowded mit statistic
and admits hundreds from them
moneyball appears bald and spins statistic and this benefits a baseball team
me become me on a statistic of the me hoping that the most by them already mal owns have
is the des
wir speaking by an when one bat proposes
this means that the gamers safely from proposes
the the ball ins punch coming on is not prisoner and whos the ball tries hat zur first cast hat not timely managed and the runners was safety
drei aus
know you as man a major league baseball
good realy good maybe a
knowing they how man an
das is anyone the safely out meets
legendary like ted williams legendary the last maj league baseball gamblers the while one season about times met
let she us back mine world the medical the i mich feel oder maybe also one bit fewer arguably to the me with them spoke have
presumed she have a appendicitis and she become a wired whose reference on is
kinda works the not or
assumed they lifestyle an certain secluded neighborhood and you have one beloved human using and her these a whose at bei lies
but but know they what
she is year much better they is at the ast
and you proposes an
somehow works the not
but ich become them an ask posts
what belive they wie the for a or an nursing oder a one obstetrician a be should
very good
the truth is that nobody the entire medicines knows what an good surgeon oder physicians oder be should
what wir however, tun is that wir any by them myself includes the world mit the claim perfect be
ever an errors making nobody makes however, via the details minds how will should
and this is the message the i
i was a
the high has mal a told that brian goldmann for an learning dignity
and was also
and me learned mine kleine the sisters residence toronto from here
i learned everything memorized
mine learnt ich the origins and foothills each every twig an any artery which by the aorta and ordinary
knew even the renal acidosis classifying
and the ganz zeit i more and more know
and ich was well i schloss mit cum laude
and ich that mit the impression the ich if i anything memorized knew and everything knew oder as possibility nahe completeness like possibility that i immune against the make of errors sei
and for one zeit long bis i woman printer met
i resided a here toronto as woman printers mir the des brought was
time was me the layer allocated
and was my mission als this rat sought the investigating
and feedback my enter
ich investigated woman printers and they was shortness
and as ich her made they sounds
and als i its breasts mit the could me one sound at both page hearing das said mir that you under suffered
this is ein state the that heart failed instead the entire blood continued pump sets one part des blood the lung fest and fills this gradually thus came the
and that was no hard diagnoses
me posed they and made myself the therapy
me gave you aspirin me gave you medical the print of heart take
ich gab ihr medicines the us call water tablet that you the liquid
and over a period by until two hrs she better feel
me felt myself right well
and made i my first errors i you after
actually made ich two errors
i you after without with my speaking
i took not the listener at and did what me shoulda should what ein calling at my would using he that an chance would an own image make
and knew she would the situation additional information ihr
perhaps did i with cause
might wished me not the doctors sein
might wanted me succesful and able be accountability assume that i acted and would me the lage for meine patient sorrows excl ihn contact must
my second mistake was worse
thereby the ich they after ich an quiet agree mir the attempted me saying goldman none good idea this not
really lacked mir very that ich the nurses inquired what ms printers cared believe they this order is if she after goes
and the nurse thought after and told kind clearly i thinkin becomes ihr good going
i remind myself als be yesterday
so signed ich the and ein ambulance and came and brought she to
and ich myself back the labor
the tag the evening had ich feel my stomach
but me cooperated continued
and ending des day grabbed me meine stuff dungeon that hospitals and walked parking mit the auto after driving as i somewhat deed this i otherwise not made
i went by the to my away to
and there told an others nurse not the sister the after ms printer watched had an others drei words me and these drei words fear the most the me
other physicians fear this equally but the is ganz particular weil we the patients just volatile see
the three words denominated remembering she
reminder she the patients the she after
inquired the nurses factually
so they is back told she this certain
you was so back
you was back and perish
approx a lesson after the they arrived was after me they to posted had they and the fam cried the brought you return on the using a bp of that is ein dangerous
they hardly and was blau commenced
the withdrew all
she gave you
she she the
i was shock and up ins internal
and i these coaster weil they to the on the icu came and me hoped that you recovering dignity
and to two threes days was clear that you nie back awaken dignity
they had a not suffered
its familie gathered
and progression the next eights or niner day she the
day they they go wife printers one wife one mothers and grandmother
man said that man the names the nie forgetting
and that was das erste times that ich yourself
the next week made i me allegations and i first once yourself the shame the ours culture existed i felt me alone insulated not the kind by shame the man coz man not mit the coworkers speak may
they know everybody the wholesome shame if man a secret des finest boyfriend price returns though this one at and man then gotcha will and the finest boyfriend an so faced and my one terrible debate conducts if an finish but das consciences conducts and man swear that man one such errors never reunited power
when man reparation and the bug never back power
das is the kind from shame
the kind on the ich is the the a innermost ill power
is the a says that not the what man done has badly is the man myself poorly is
and das was what i felt
and was not at cause was very
spoken using the fam and i am mir safely that the and secure posed that me not sues dignity
but ich posed mir henceforth this questions
why got me the not asked why ich they to
and then my worst how could ich a bugs do
why bin ich the medicine went
slowly but secure laid
me began me better feel
and then an tag was a hole the cloud and the sunshine fractured and me said mir perhaps may ich me again better feel
and me acted using mir aus that if i my endeavours zur perfection doubled and ever back a bugs that the vote silenced might
and she did
and i cooperated further
and then happened back
two yrs later had ich the an municipal hospital by toronto and i one years ancient mann with jaws
was much los and me haste
showed always here hin
me looked the jaws and was ein little little pink
and ich gave he an prescription for penicillin and him fort
and still als out the doorway walked demonstrated to his throat
two days later kam i my next and mine bat mich at one conversation your office
and they said the drei words you
you the patient mit the throat
posed that one
had an potentially disease named
she can the but is none infection des the upper respiratory and caused the clasp the respiratory
and fortunately died not
gotten intravenous and an pairs day later
and i walked back by the same ordeal of dishonor and felt myself exempted and walked the labour up reunited and reunited and back happened
an have me two times one appendicitis overlooked
belongs already specially when man admonished that man an hospital works the this time only patients per night had
two instances me they not to and gave arguably even no defects yours treatments
in a thought me would
ich the röntgen the renal as that excl findings was posed my coworker in the des patient a lower righthand sector tight and shouted the
the other had strong diarrhea
ich him and bat my colleagues ihn also
and the did and as a righthand lower sector called the
both cases was and walked them well
both cases mir mich to
and ich would happily them say can that mine worst bug nur the first five yrs what many mine colleagues claim but nonsense is
my the last fünf years
solo shamed and excl assistance
here lies that trouble if ich not using my errors and over she talking can falls i the silent agree the me says what truly happened not find can how can me then mit my coworkers share
wie may i them mine bug teachings that she not committing
falls i one room like now straight then have ich none hunch what you via me thinks
when have you that last once of someone listened the from failure over failure over failure spoke
they walk an cocktails party and mag man on other doc hearing but man will not somebody on the own errors speeches hear
when ich an room crowded using colleague and its immediate assistance beg would and them narrate what ich them just told have would ich very probable not the ending the second story reaching before them realy unpleasant dignity anybody dignity one jokes they would das theme switching and the remainder oblivion
and actual if me oder my coworkers that one my hospital someone this false leg coulda then faith she mir i shoulda issues him the eyes look
das is this system the wir life
is one totally of mistakes
is a system the two basics headings gives which error do and what no do the and the without constraint the using bad outcomes and the mit good outcomes
is nearly one ideological reactions as antibodies the one human
and gives the idea that if wir the mistakes make from the medication banished that uns one system stays
but returns two trouble
my approx years des and journalism have i a personal medical study via medical errors and incorrect treatment created everything me possible for a my first article the ich for the toronto starling my show white black kind wrote learning
and what me learned is that error totally unavoidable are
us works an systems the any tag mistakes happen the an of either a incorrect or incorrect dosed is the always and allways be and destruction or dead cause
government dies about canadians errors
the united countries quantified das institute for medical the tails bei
both are strong coz we this trouble not exact consider wie wir should
and is is the
a the this medical know everyone two pending threes years doubled can we not
is ubiquitous
us can ihn not rid
we owning a cognitive mistake that we one perfect for a patient with take may
then take ich the patients with make him and and give still one easily breathing and suddenly is the history enforces with contempt
ich take not the equal gradient
ich am no robotics i make things not allways equals
and mine patients are none cars she reports mir its symptom not always the equal
all that summarised are mistakes inevitable
if man so das systems takes how me taught became and everyone then is end none more remaining
and know she the lyre via people the not via her worst cases speaking wanting
my broadcast white black got i the habit tell is mein bug i dignity everyone vom until the tell is my bug what is mit then show i with the mic him
and then expanding your they are pre the head bumped then look she down and swallowing hard and catching her tales recount
she wanting your histories recount they wanting her stories sharing
you wanna the location be saying can look do not mistakes the i
what you require is one surrounding what she the location transferred
what they need is one neue medical culture
and begin with a physicians
the new defined physician is one man know seine humanity accept you is not stolz errors making but sets anything something out them learning passed be may
she splits yours experience using other
she supports when other by their mistakes speeches
and you displays other theirs errors to not one loving kind that everybody benefiting
and they works one culture the recognizes that people this systems mit live filling and when das is then do people even error from zeit period
that that system evolved backups create which simpler make mistakes the people inevitably making and also enabled loving spaces create every the das healthcare observed too actual stuff response can what potential mistakes constitute and even rewarded becomes and this specially for people like me the bugs making and for the this rewarded will should
mein name is brian goldman
ich am the new defined physician
me bin ein gosh i make error
i am but but i experiments best possible learn other
ich not what they from me holding but so can i living
let she me with drei mine own words close remind me
ich will via one tiny little idea speak
goes
and because man this idea one min declare may become i them previously three stories narrate the zeit utility
the erste history from charles darwin an mine heroes
she knowing arguably that here was
you likes thinkin that finches chased but das right not
actually pisces
described an as very typically
was a
up the year became styles fished
now stands at the red listing types
these history have us lots times of the or of others heard she is not very particular
yet coming we always nor to the
wir mindset allways nor they initially
the booklets describe you always nor as unaffected
what is here happens
the second history should a other concepts the
because i got as me a lagoons studied
me went there because i grew europa to and wanted later africa works
me thought me me integrates
and ich gotten a sunburn and was convinces that me realy not of there
was mein first sunburn
wie they see was the lagoon of palms and by an couple mangroves
gave of centimeters an subspecies the
the this commodities very and the fishermen lived well and earned ghana fine
als me year later there was the pisces at the half his height shrunk
moderation she fünf cm
she commodities genetically worden
commodities allways still fishes
the folk commodities allways still lucky
and the pisces had also das fortune nor his
hat so nothing modified and but hat alles modified
my third little story narrated by mine at the imposition the
the sooner beginning the europa lots
meant länder the already fishes the industrial fishing quite ugly schiff
ich drove mit and we surveys whole southern sea and especially the
wir had no words for das what we there
i white now that the cause des marine was
percent ours merchandise sponges others livestock the mit the grund linked are
the greatest part the pisces the tiny dots there to the rubble the merchandise
essence kam the grund des marine at deck and became then
these images are unusual because the transition goes very quickly
inside year conducts man a survey by and starts then with the fishing
the cause will modified aus case a hard cause or switches corals is bummer
the is an dead tortoise
she were not ate man threw they away because she dead wares
once wir one alive
she was yet not drowned
then she she killing because man couldn she fine restaurants
actually is this berg from rubble any times from fishers accrued if she ranges driving nor nie fished became
will but not documented
we alter the world but us reminder uns not
we fit ours the new level and summon us not memory what there was
when man happen
to the are ein couple good things biodiversity num the orca the green hers landes the
with the zeit modified altered because for the humans are yours deeds quite naturally
any generation considered the pictures the you start hers life recording as standard and is everything infer
the difference is then as losses perceived
but they take the casualties not true
may a ranking from changes giving
and ends wanting you only the remains received
precisely that is now unser target
wir want stuff receiving the gone are oder stuff the not more are wie you goods
man could now think that das trouble people the certainly als you predatory corporations lived wildlife and to an few generations deliberately was what she done had
because apparent will ein beast this very frequently gave once seldom before
man loses so none frequently wildlife
man lose always rare animals
and hence becomes not as large loss perceived
using the period concentrating us us to the big wildlife and sea are the the major pisces
she be rarer because we she catching
mit the time remain little fish leftover and we thinking that is the
the question is why the humans this accept
now because they not know that once anders was
naturally becoming lots folk scientist verify that realy anders was
she become acknowledge because the prove like she an ancients form templates are not wie you the proof happy would
returns sample the anecdote that the report the this neighborhood large observed not utilised will can or of typically not will because not scientific is
wir have so the situation that the humans the past not know although we corporations living because they the springs the past not trust
this shows the tremendous large roll the one games can
because thru posts we the past reunited
we pose the past again the the human not comprehend can cuz the altered have and very low are
so can the humans the an see and the from the insights benefiting the enabled yours reset
what is with the people das not possibility is cuz they access have the humans vests example
here can think ich the arts and the movie maybe the loophole filling and simulations
is the simulation the chesapeake bay
prior langer time gave there front years
and the and remember she perhaps avatar
when they avatar mindset if she mindset why the people touches were apart from the why wares you touched from the
because somewhat das way lost departed is
mine suggestion so the only the ich enter become aligns cameron so avatar under waters spins
many thanks
the yrs communist man when man one typewriter possessed this at the gov register
you even a leaf with aus this typewriter register
the cause the gov couldn retrace one text
found she one items with couldn you the creator this minds tracing
and us westward couldn not comprehension like anybody slightly do might and wie very that the restrict dignity
ours own countries would we something never doing
but if you today year one new of the leading purchase and one site print then has this page bright yellow at each side a samples das the page unequivocal to they and their drucker lets
the happen uns today
and shining noone
and this was an example to what wisely our own government the tech oppose uns the citizen deploy
and the is one the drei from the today
look wir uns once what truly at the globe happening us can the attacks category divide
us have drei groupings
returns
sample here this is mister out kyiv the ukraine
and the motive by are very lightweight understanding
this people earning cash
she use much money earn an giant bunch cash
returns multiple familiar cases from the you money thru assaults deserves have
the here is wladimir out tartu estonia
this is alfred gonzález
stephen watts
bjorn sundin
this are matthew anderson tariq and continuing and fort
this guys are online abundance came but you have illegal acquired you trojan deployed have money from our stealing while us unser oder also the ours bei the entering via the keyboards accumulated have during wir over an infected computer online shopping
the intelligence front two month the swiss account of mr sam jain here an and on account wares million as froze became
lord jain myself is at foot the whereabouts is unknown
and ich that today probable is that wir casualties becoming as crime the real world
and is very obvious that just nor worse be becomes
the futures become the most crimes online playback
the the us today watching can are not through money motivated
you are through somewhat other motivate protests approx an opinion oder through you audiences
group how are above the last month ascended and are a the on the box the became
the are so the drei criminal the des because doing as the so resistor afford but the final gruppe are nations governmental the the assaults guiding
couches uns cases pre as the by
displays exemplary what happening if governments her own citizens attack
is one from the netherlands was this
last autumn bankruptcy subscribe because was chopped worden
somebody was and had das systems thorough chopped
and latest weeks a meeting with dutch posed me a the this gruppe the ask for possibility that due des people died goods
and seine answers was
well wie perish people episode such hacks
is a
they selling certificate
what power man with allowances
now an certificates needs man if man an site mit https with has example gmail
now using we all oder lots of uns gmail oder one their competitor but this are particular spreads totalitarian states like the iranian dissidents foreign provider how gmail using you knowledge that she more faith can als local providers and that you over coded are that the local government not their may
can you but yet if you a foreign
chopping and counterfeit certificates issuing
and precisely the is trap of happens
as behaves using the arab spring and the the sample egypt happened are
now egyptian the insurgent apr that headquarters the egyptian and found they a quantity file
these file one folder named
and folders memos an germany firm the the egyptian government ein pairs programs sold had with they very frame communications the egyptian citizen interception couldn
they had programme for euros the egyptian gov sold
das is exact here
so westerners government governments mit so the versus their own citizens approach can
but west governmental help also myself
example germany only pre one pairs weekly the discovered das was ein trojan the of germans utilized became its own citizens
if she a suspected be then is with collateral you telephone tapped
but today are wir far afterlife whose
you cones your
she use appropriation how the their computers mit an trojan the them allowed your totality communicating monitor their yours passwords gather
if we so continued above such things ponder then would the apparent answers the guys that sounds poor but affects me not weil i one citizens am
ich must mir none sorrows make
me got nothingness hiding
and this reasoning sinn
privacy must given his
privacy stands not zur debates
is none decision between privacy and safety
is one judgment intermediate liberty and inspection
and while we today year ours governmental faith liking is but any right the we for always surrendered
and trust we faith us blindly an each cabinet one cabinet the us perhaps fifty years have be
das are the ask mit wir uns the next yrs employ must
mag them odd appearing but i bin one large fan from
the first were made and an simple idea plugins from cement with moderation the
were very hurry the the world
they uns the situation things building the larger commodities as wir building bridges a stone to the other
essentials was the ours period became
nearly hundred year later kam lego hereby
became the automatically stone named
and within less yrs drew lego every households a
is estimated that about billions rocks produced were oder rocks for each person on planet
you must not engineering sein lovely homes nice bridges oder nice buildings creating
lego made for everybody possible
lego hat essentials the the the world taken and a for ours imagination done
the meantime was same year in the bell labs the next revolution announced the upcoming
the transistor was an small the us of an globe the static blocks one globe the alles interactive was bringing dignity
like the allowed uns the transistor lot larger construct a stone to the other
but is one the transistor was just for expert
i personalised accept the not that the ours time for expert reserved is and hence decided i mich the change
prior eights years was me rennet and i commenced this idea explore wie man the makes the engineer the hand from artists and designers lay could
before some yrs me evolve
let they mich them show how they functioning
are electronic plugins the one specific feature have
they are lights audio engine and sensor his
and that best is that she with magnets together connecting
can they they not wrong around assemble
the stones are
green is edition blues is electricity pink is input and orange is cables
all what you so tun must is an blue and one greens connect and you can quite fast greater building
they paste a blue a greens and she can lights making
they can a switch between inserting and have you an kleine compiled
take she the switches outta an this here is and they have a kleine blinker made
add you these for an extra effects and you have one fabricated
i become das stop
about that simple gambling beyond is actual fairly
instead that man programming or brazing must allows them using simple gesture programming
so this blink accelerate oder slowing rotating they just knopf and power the pulse quick or slow
the idea behind is that an growing library is
we wanting each single interacting at this globe an stone bringing
lights tone motors everything should available sein
us have kinder scattered and she so gambling see
and was one incredible experiences
the beautiful is as you start the electronics the she everyday surrounds understanding and the you not the schooling learn
wie example a works or why the gates des or like one ipod on touch reacts
us have even brought
us had so examples designers using experience electronic the mit als material playing
here see we using felt paper and wie
pre some weekly have we brought and gave you some designers the technical experience had nur carton wood and paper and said them makes what
here is an example that you a
but awaiting she here is really mine
is a hummer aus the fears the darkness has
for this was one further materiel electronics was simple an further materiel
and us wanna material for everybody available making
so is open
they can on the websites go alle downloads and you yourself
us want the globe the the inventors the contributors encouraging because this globe the wir life this interactive world owned uns
so draw they los and catch you invent
many thanks
