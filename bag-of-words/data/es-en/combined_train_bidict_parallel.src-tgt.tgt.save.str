my eyes went onto type ii .
we asked them , &quot; &quot; can you send guerrillas a message ? &quot; &quot; we collected over 6,000 messages .
bear in mind there are two things about this .
and again , it forms the same straight line . you have a little bit of thickening in the line because people do have disagreements , what the key points are , there &apos;s differences of opinion when agriculture started , or how long the cambrian explosion took .
in our daily life we are continuously disturbed by aggressive sounds .
low-income people spend a lot more than a thousand on lotteries .
we &apos;d catch cat-naps at 40 below on our sled , incidentally .
of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular .
so she did things to us , which now she &apos;d be arrested for , such as pushing us out of the car , and telling us to find our own way to granny &apos;s , about five miles before we actually got there .
but i &apos;ve talked about education and employment .
but perhaps the most exciting thing about it is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere .
they could be quite mild .
it &apos;s capitalism as it was ultimately meant to be , meeting important needs , not incrementally competing for trivial differences in product attributes and market share .
but i claim that b is incomparably worse .
so if i were emperor of the internet , i guess i &apos;d still be mortal , huh ?
and it completely changed how i do movies .
and he &apos;s seriously one of the funniest — i call him yoda , because you talk to the guy , you get an email from him , and you &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m not worthy . this guy &apos;s so amazing . &quot; &quot; the other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world — literally every corner of the world — into our house .
don &apos;t start telling me why you didn &apos;t do something .
as i looked down at her in the bed , i thought to myself , if you just tried caring even a little bit , you wouldn &apos;t be in this situation at this moment with some doctor you &apos;ve never met about to amputate your foot .
he said , &quot; &quot; how did target figure out that this high school girl was pregnant before she told her parents ? &quot; &quot; it turns out that they have the purchase history for hundreds of thousands of customers and they compute what they call a pregnancy score , which is not just whether or not a woman &apos;s pregnant , but what her due date is .
and let &apos;s say it &apos;s a foundation . they will provide the funds .
jp : oh , hi darling , how are you ?
they &apos;re also able to reason at high levels .
derek paravicini : i taught myself to play .
and what can you do to challenge ?
and when people tell me , &quot; &quot; who &apos;s going to teach the teachers to teach the kids ? &quot; &quot; i say to myself , &quot; &quot; what planet do you come from ? &quot; &quot; okay , there &apos;s not a person in this room — i don &apos;t care how techie you are — there &apos;s not a person in this room that doesn &apos;t give their laptop or cell phone to a kid to help them debug it . ok ?
so this building actually celebrates the water as it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed so that it can be filtered for the final time .
i took this video last week . here &apos;s a paraplegic patient actually walking by strapping on these exoskeletons .
so he was using social media in private .
not to say , &quot; &quot; oh my god , what is it ? &quot; &quot; but to be challenged by it — to say , &quot; &quot; wow , this is beautiful , &quot; &quot; on one level , but on the other level , &quot; &quot; this is scary . i shouldn &apos;t be enjoying it . &quot; &quot; like a forbidden pleasure . and it &apos;s that forbidden pleasure that i think is what resonates out there , and it gets people to look at these things , and it gets people to enter it . and it also , in a way , defines kind of what i feel , too — that i &apos;m drawn to have a good life .
we have a moral obligation to invent technology so that every person on the globe has the potential to realize their true difference .
is there a way to produce algae inexpensively ?
and thank you very much .
if a company was going to donate a block of a decision scientist &apos;s time , it would actually make more sense to spread out that block of time over a long period , say for example five years .
you can see the different seasons there .
of course , this was the holy grail of our industry , and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn &apos;t help either , because i &apos;m sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store , you know — we see his face constantly .
and scientists that have studied this have said they &apos;ve never seen an accident .
( laughter ) but you get the picture . and then it goes to the inauguration .
there are , of course , the therapeutic results of this , but then there are the un-therapeutic ones and they seem to be the ones gaining traction , particularly in the media .
in a 12-month period when i was at the orphanage , only one child had been adopted .
and so now all the birds come in . and i have hawks .
do you know how hard that is to avoid when you actually work at facebook ?
so ...
you know , i like to call it &quot; &quot; the national automobile slum . &quot; &quot; you can call it suburban sprawl .
so the cambrian explosion , when all the body plans of the animals were evolved , took only 10 million years . it was 200 times faster .
and as for outsiders , white , black or brown , tar and feather them , and whip them out of town .
we kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics and that selects for resistant mutants .
we &apos;re really good at small numbers .
and then i thought i would share with you what that method is , or one of them .
now what we &apos;re seeing lots of examples of , obviously , is the opening up of government data , not enough examples of this yet , but we &apos;re starting to see this practice of people creating and generating innovative applications on top of government data .
but when you shake it , you get pakistan &apos;s perspective .
and he had to close his eyes , it &apos;s so disgusting , and the smell and everything .
&quot; use a condom , don &apos;t get aids . &quot;
but first i want to say that the intensity and persistence with which we experience these emotional components of regret is obviously going to vary depending on the specific thing that we &apos;re feeling regretful about .
in particular , i &apos;m interested in the relationship to the future financial self .
an image is worth more than a thousand words , so i &apos;m going to start my talk by stop talking and show you a few images that i recently captured .
i am passionate about the american landscape and how the physical form of the land , from the great central valley of california to the bedrock of manhattan , has really shaped our history and our character .
my mother in accra , my twin sister in boston , my best friends in new york : these relationships are home for me .
okay ? so i want you to think about that problem as we go on , and count how many symmetries there are .
so dystonia is a disorder affecting children .
were invented by dr. yoram palti , professor emeritus at the technion in israel .
we knew conservation would fail if it doesn &apos;t work to improve the lives of the local communities .
it has taken many years , but it has been very rewarding .
you needn &apos;t bring the gun into the uk anymore .
i &apos;m showing you two works , one on the right by leon golub , one on the left by robert colescott .
and i &apos;ve been studying it for a couple years .
he died 25 years ago this year , and was born 75 years ago this year .
in countless accidents , the driver says , &quot; i didn &apos;t see it coming . &quot;
it &apos;s too much energy on a planet .
( laughter ) paper .
so let me tell you about the u-report , which i &apos;m really excited about . it &apos;s 150,000 millennials all across uganda , young people armed with 2g phones , an sms social network exposing government corruption and demanding to know what &apos;s in the budget and how their money is being spent .
it &apos;s become the de facto battle for gay equality , and it seems like daily , laws prohibiting it are being challenged in the courts , even in places like texas and utah , which no one saw coming .
most of our countries don &apos;t even have any opinion research .
i &apos;ve discovered these people , who , in v-day world , we call vagina warriors .
trend-following would have been great in the &apos; 60s , and it was sort of ok in the &apos; 70s .
and you could tell very easily when your experiment was working and wasn &apos;t , and where it was in the phase .
i don &apos;t think it will transport 200 people in the next years .
mb : so i love the effervescence , bubbling up .
they don &apos;t own those facilities .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever felt so happy in my entire life .
i was privileged to have that kind of good start .
so , this is a six-shot sequence .
and what they &apos;re finding is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants can be highly toxic to phytoplankton , which is very bad news , because so much life depends on it .
i &apos;ll leave it at that , thank you very much .
fast forward to 2002 .
and the rules and the belief systems were wildly disparate .
three years later , we have the perimeter institute for theoretical physics in waterloo , ontario . it ’ s the most exciting job i ’ ve ever had .
and that &apos;s the kind of polishing that these mirrors have endured .
i really believe that you have to have a passion for it .
now we do daydreaming in 11 : 30 with 55 seconds left .
and that was the end of the shrinking of vacuum tubes , but it was not the end of the exponential growth of computing .
and this is the first theater project i worked on .
what you see there on the screen is a human hair superimposed on the needle that &apos;s made of silk — just to give you a sense of size .
now looking at a few cases , here &apos;s one of the first cases that we had .
so does a site like this have rules ?
this happens because typically tumors are areas where the immune system has no access , and so bacteria find these tumors and use them as a safe haven to grow and thrive .
and she said to them , &quot; &quot; vusi &apos;s here , and you &apos;re not going to take him tonight .
now , the himba live in northern namibia on the border of angola , and i &apos;d been there a few times before , and i &apos;d gone back to present this book i &apos;d made , to show them the pictures , to get into a discussion with them , to say , &quot; &quot; this is how i saw you . this is how i love you .
if they stick with the process , if they stick with it , they end up doing amazing things and they surprise themselves just how innovative they and their teams really are .
now , given both the common sense and scientific data calling the doctrine of the blank slate into question , why should it have been such an appealing notion ?
i looked it up , and he was right .
♫ not to discuss this at length , ♫ ♫ but my body image was never my strength . ♫ ♫ so frankly , i wish that you all would get dressed , ♫ ♫ i mean , you &apos;re not even really naked . ♫ ♫ and i &apos;m the one with the problem . ♫ ♫ and you tell me , don &apos;t worry so much , you &apos;ll be great . ♫ ♫ but i &apos;m the one living with me ♫ ♫ and i know how i get . ♫ ♫ your advice is gentle but late . ♫ ♫ if not just a bit patronizing . ♫ ♫ and that sarcastic tone doesn &apos;t help me when i sing . ♫
several western companies are now adopting frugal innovation to create affordable products for western consumers .
this region responds when you think about what another person is thinking .
the result : most of the deaths have been in people under 30 years of age , robustly healthy young adults .
and it &apos;s part of what tedwomen does .
and that is the same reef ; that &apos;s the same reef 15 years ago ; that &apos;s the same reef today .
he took women with metastatic breast cancer , randomly divided them into two groups .
as a matter of fact , 1964 was the year with the highest birth rate ever in germany : more than 1.3 million .
my desire to create a sensor-based technology perhaps stemmed from my lifelong love for sensors and technology .
and it &apos;s this convergence that gives us this incredible pace .
but the only way we &apos;re going to be able to write it is if we do it together .
and here , you can see one such example , where we label the fibers coming from the brain in red .
just to give you a few examples : &quot; ending a pregnancy &quot; versus &quot; killing a fetus ; &quot; &quot; a ball of cells &quot; versus &quot; an unborn child ; &quot; &quot; invading iraq &quot; versus &quot; liberating iraq ; &quot; &quot; redistributing wealth &quot; versus &quot; confiscating earnings . &quot;
and those beautiful wispy clouds are , in fact , fires , human-made fires .
it &apos;s a gambler &apos;s game even today .
you see the heart coming out there . it takes about 40 minutes to print , and about four to six hours later you see the muscle cells contract .
i photographed him at the scene of arrest in chicago .
you &apos;d stay until , at some point , the jail would be booked to capacity , and they &apos;d want to book someone new in .
but how can i tell an eight-year-old boy that his father is a politician ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) now , as a politician myself , standing in front of you , or indeed , meeting any stranger anywhere in the world , when i eventually reveal the nature of my profession , they look at me as though i &apos;m somewhere between a snake , a monkey and an iguana , and through all of this , i feel , strongly , that something is going wrong .
even the pencil .
now just don &apos;t untie me no matter what . &quot; &quot; he throws the first mate to the ground .
but we have to use its power wisely .
thank you .
and there , we sat down , and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on mt . everest .
that gets your adrenaline going .
right ? it &apos;s beans ; right ? it &apos;s coffee beans .
well , if we &apos;re going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of millennium development goals that we &apos;re set as a world , we need to learn from the innovators , and those innovators come from every single sector .
( laughter ) it &apos;s pretty scary . ( laughter )
truth be told , i have never found a role model i could truly identify with .
but of course , that was in austria at the height of romantic lyricism , not here in the suburbs of cleveland . ( laughter )
and this excites me , because this means that the energy it takes to accommodate someone with a disability can be leveraged , molded and played with as a force for creativity and innovation .
it &apos;s got two people inside it on stilts , which give them the height , and somebody in the front who &apos;s using a kind of steering wheel to move that head .
and when you label something as objective and rational , automatically , the other side , the subjective and emotional , become labeled as non-science or anti-science or threatening to science , and we just don &apos;t talk about it .
no bill ever disappeared .
there &apos;s sustaining innovation , which will sustain an existing institution or an organization , and disruptive innovation that will break it apart , create some different way of doing it .
we know we &apos;ll use electricity in 20 or 30 years &apos; time .
they give 20 minutes — that &apos;s a time warning .
but in order to find out the real secrets of these creatures &#91; it was necessary &#93; for us to actually insert a small radio transmitter inside &#91; each &#93; snake .
in this strange moment where , like , these things kind of appeared .
so this is a — i used to kind of be an actor .
so again , the really important question is what happens when we change the statistical data ever so slightly .
doctors have a saying that , in fact , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re not dead until you &apos;re warm and dead . &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s true . it &apos;s true .
it &apos;s an insult to the basic laws of nature and of biology .
so there are many reasons , and for all of these reasons , this is time and this is why we must talk .
ss : well , on your way to the olympics , a couple of memorable events happened at georgetown .
i &apos;d like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward .
this object should be ice over a silicate core .
that story perfectly captures for me the final lesson that i learned : happiness is not something we find , it &apos;s something we make .
now we &apos;ve had 50 years of warnings .
and then magd came .
for a minute , i felt like my existence as a person had been noticed , and i was worth saving .
that &apos;s why when , in california , we try to deal with all the solar we &apos;ve brought online — we now get about 10 percent of electricity from solar — when the sun goes down , and people come home from work and turn on their air conditioners and their tv sets , and every other appliance in the house , we need a lot of natural gas backup .
one of those most remarkable parts about all of this is it gives us an entirely new way to understand new information , stuff that we haven &apos;t seen before .
we branch off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
i had a scholarship .
well , one of the problems , of course , turns out to be testing .
well , you feel some chest pain or indigestion .
if you don &apos;t tell us how you did it , we won &apos;t trust you .
the moorish artists were denied the possibility to draw things with souls .
i end with — the koreans did this .
and that was because every hydrostatic skeleton that we had found in nature up to that point had the same basic elements .
actually , you could say i grew up in the capital of dominican republic , otherwise known as washington heights in new york city .
either a conscious agent is carrying out the computation , or he &apos;s got a piece of machinery that admits of a computational interpretation .
if the group doesn &apos;t take action , the other 33 groups have to decide what is going to happen to the group that doesn &apos;t comply with those great deals that we are offering them .
so what you &apos;re seeing here are a couple of machines — a pattern of locomotion .
chris anderson : so i guess what we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re going to talk about your life , and using some pictures that you shared with me .
this is one of the things they ought to be thinking more about .
and users , for all of us — we can demand technology that works this way .
buy african products .
as we think about intersecting technologies — everybody has a cell phone with a camera — we could use this everywhere , whether it be health care , patient care , engineering , law , conferencing , translating videos .
( audience : jack of spades . ) lg : jack of spades . jack of spades .
in this case , they were using a real stunt man . it was a very dangerous stunt .
( music ) another solo now . see what you can pick up from this . ( music )
and we &apos;re starting to be much more careful about how we save and how we invest .
the good-news stories in medicine are early detection , early intervention .
it basically directed the sounds onto a diaphragm that vibrated a needle that essentially engraved the sound on tinfoil that was wrapped around the cylinder .
it &apos;s one way of describing what happened with deregulation of the financial services in the u.s. and the u.k.
and this is interesting from an artistic point of view .
an ideograph is like a brush painting , a japanese brush painting .
they seem fantastic to me . they cost very little to develop .
the best way to spiral into a cycle of poverty is to kill the parents .
and it has been named okapi faunal reserve because of this beautiful creature .
i said , &quot; &quot; yes , your holiness .
so , without this technology you can &apos;t see the stars .
hopefully everybody ? more than 10 ?
this approach is called integrated water management , or holistic or closed-loop .
but here is what &apos;s really great .
we have the power to do that .
beyond these sorts of things , a medical doctor didn &apos;t have a lot that they could do .
go to the open house and express your options .
i mean , it seems like you &apos;re still a little bit in the growth phases , you &apos;re still doing these incredible new plans .
they even applaud it .
and as i pause for a few seconds , have a look at the screen .
and i &apos;m just going to read one of them to you .
would you like kim jong-il , who &apos;s killed about two million people , would you like him gone ?
essentially , here you have all the bling-bling of the world &apos;s museums organized for you .
and no tv , no radio , no newspaper , no one to talk to .
you get health insurance ? dental ?
imagine you are in a maternity ward in mali , and have a newborn in need of urgent medication .
they needed fewer hospitalizations .
and nature builds large skeletons out of it .
so we can actually use biomaterials now .
( music ) and just like that , the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality .
spect imaging is a brain-scanning technology that uses a radioactive tracer to track blood flow in the brain .
however , still , as you can see , it has a cord , umbilical cord . so , we &apos;re still using an external power source and external computation .
there &apos;s not one that we know of . &quot; &quot; so they &apos;re doing that , and we &apos;re going to launch it later this year , and it &apos;s all an experiment , and it &apos;s all voluntary .
so this is very conscious knowledge .
what force is driving all galaxies to rush away from every other at an ever-quickening speed ?
and the truth is i don &apos;t really understand a lot of what they &apos;re talking about .
where &apos;s art ? i got productivity . i got sports .
when i reach the summit of a steep mountain in the middle of nowhere , i feel young , invincible , eternal .
all of these thousands of loosely connected little pieces are coming together , and it &apos;s about time we ask the question , how do we want to evolve human beings over the next century or two ?
mt : which means magic is theater and every trick is a story .
i tried to think , &quot; &quot; how do i respond to that hopelessness ?
four years ago , i showed you this picture .
we need to be able to measure progression objectively , and ultimately , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure .
you can &apos;t do that with head-tail-tail .
why has it accelerated lately ?
we need lots more .
until quite recently , we simply didn &apos;t know how many brazilians were killed by guns .
my wife started to fine me one dollar for every irrelevant fact i inserted into conversation .
this is a challenge that we share with thousands of other researchers around the world .
it was , like , this is my time for shine .
if you ask men why they did a good job , they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m awesome .
it takes what we know , and it twists it .
my foot goes down its throat . it spits me out .
we live on a planet .
the lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles — a car approaching from the front , the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads , any obstacles around the vehicle .
also the visual separation .
a remarkable idea , and yet evidence is growing almost weekly , with new papers coming out , confirming that this does indeed take place .
and even though the color was pretty hideous , i did love the car , and it really cemented my love affair with cars that &apos;s continued on to this day .
parents pool their money to hire some local teachers to a private , tiny , unofficial school .
and shipping is the greenest method of transport .
one billion dollars of our taxpayers &apos; money has been located in offshore bank accounts .
it &apos;s the single largest emitter of greenhouse gases of any human activity in the world .
look , there is like 50-plus years of good cancer research that discovered major , major things that taught us about cancer .
and this is a song that &apos;s about — it &apos;s the kind of song that everyone has their version of .
ca : can we see that ? em : yeah .
muzetta &apos;s family give the lie to this .
we &apos;ve driven well over 100,000 miles now totally automated .
now this is not a problem of resources ; this is a problem of incentives .
so when i virtually touch data , it will generate forces in the pen , so i get a feedback .
( applause )
let &apos;s start with the hobbies . when you get dementia , it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself .
and into that ferment came the microprocessor .
i mean i &apos;ve rarely seen lines so flat .
this is a chicken with teeth .
&quot; that misses the point . &quot;
we evolved essentially from an african stock .
right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year that i &apos;ll talk a little bit about .
and i think that can be some really good news .
it &apos;s my response , my attitude , to oppression that i &apos;ve got control over , and that i can do something about .
well , the kids loved the food .
staying is the new shame .
what we see is a unique , personal , virtual reality that is masterfully constructed by our brain .
if the rules for the universe are simple , it &apos;s kind of inevitable that they have to be very abstract and very low level ; operating , for example , far below the level of space or time , which makes it hard to represent things .
ok , so the question is : do we see this in the sky ?
somebody told me today there was this thing called folders , but i don &apos;t know what they are .
but unless we start testing those intuitions , we &apos;re not going to do better .
that &apos;s getting closer .
i couldn &apos;t make it , &quot; &quot; everyone held her breath , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; everyone held his breath , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; everyone held his or her breath . &quot; &quot; whatever i suggested had to blend in .
in fact , i went to nashville .
as a result , déclassé consumption is in .
how can such a thing exist as part of the real world ? &quot; &quot; and this , if you &apos;ve ever had a philosophy course , this is known as the famous mind-body problem .
i haven &apos;t been shot at in six years , and i was woken up very abruptly this morning by a nightmare that i was being strafed by aircraft , six years later .
and in fact , even in that very first event , ligo found things that we didn &apos;t expect .
i mean , most of us know that pitch is a fundamental building block of music .
and you just saw motts the research engineer , there , going into the mri system , and he was wearing goggles .
several years ago , we started thinking about it .
it becomes kite-shaped .
people began to buy their own postcards and make their own postcards .
their treatment is a reflection of the values held beyond prison walls .
she &apos;s being filmed with a hidden camera .
that &apos;s why we all live in developer houses .
this is a very small grain of sand , this whole thing .
it &apos;s great stuff .
he asked the pga , the professional golfers &apos; association , for permission to use a golf cart in the pga tournaments .
so when nicolaus copernicus said , actually the earth is not the center of the universe , the sun is the center of the solar system , the earth moves around the sun .
he quoted the words of all kinds of people who &apos;d had a variety of these experiences .
but really , it wasn ’ t the drugs that were important ; it was this idea that what the drugs did would help shock people out of their normal way of thinking , and getting them to forget the adult behaviors that were getting in the way of their ideas .
what you &apos;re seeing here is , we &apos;ve selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient .
and this is great because , you know , for a quarter , you can play this for a long time . ( laughter )
you can hold it like a liver , but it has no cells ; it &apos;s just a skeleton of the liver .
for every one single neuron , you can actually have from 10,000 to 100,000 different connections or dendrites or whatever you want to call it , and every time you learn something , or you have an experience , that bush grows , you know , that bush of information .
so by the time i &apos;m finished talking here , there &apos;ll be 864 more hours of video on youtube than there were when i started , and two and a half million more photos on facebook and instagram than when i started .
using acoustic emission , you know , this little noise that you hear a structure emit , sing to you when they are stressed , and reveal the damage going on , there &apos;s a collective phenomenon of positive feedback , the more damage gives the more damage , so you can actually predict , within , of course , a probability band , when the rupture will occur .
so let &apos;s move to chapter two : the oil era .
now , you need a laptop .
so we did .
in our fears , the characters are us .
the 20th century , the last hundred years , is riddled with disastrous examples of times that one school or the other tried to explain the past or predict the future and just did an awful , awful job , so the economics profession has acquired some degree of modesty .
if i &apos;m going to use the word &quot; &quot; wednesday &quot; &quot; in a sentence , and i &apos;m coming up to the word , and i can feel that i &apos;m going to stutter or something , i can change the word to &quot; &quot; tomorrow , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; the day after tuesday , &quot; &quot; or something else .
the first is electric autonomous flying vehicles .
when will it catch up ? i have to go back to very conventional graph .
so this is what russian looks like in a visual abstraction .
so thank goodness , they can &apos;t be used to engineer viruses or bacteria .
we can &apos;t afford the fanciest places to stay at night , so we tend to sleep a lot outdoors .
the schizophrenic mind is not split , but shattered .
sexual reproduction enters the picture .
15 years later , 14 or 15 years later , follow-up study .
and what we found was very , very interesting .
i had to practice it as a kid , and i &apos;m really sick of it . so — ( laughter ) i would , so what i might like to try to do is to change it , to transform it in some ways , to personalize it , so i might take the opening , like this idea — ( music ) and then i might substitute — ( music ) and then i might improvise on that melody that goes forward from there — ( music ) ( music ) so that might be the kind of thing — why thank you .
so now what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to vary the order in which these decisions appear .
poignant .
and also , again , it can — also , it &apos;s something that you — it is not something that is radiating outside .
together , we looked at a variety of biological systems , ranging from natural tropical rainforests through to managed forests and fisheries .
simply documenting these soon-to-be-demolished structures wasn &apos;t enough for me .
while browsing facebook , i saw a photo , a terrifying photo , of a tortured , dead body of a young egyptian guy .
and some people get rich enough , and if they have their ideals — in a sort of domestic sense , they get to acquire their perfect world .
if you look at some of these other items — concussions .
we need to build a log cabin , if you will , at the bottom of the sea .
you might enjoy the awkwardly tight , cut-off pajama bottoms with balloons .
we actually have a very interesting payload on there .
thank you .
and , in a way , i wanted the human figure in the picture to become a part of that nature .
thank you .
no , i &apos;m not even from jamaica . that &apos;s how they market me .
and he managed to track down , whitehead did , many of the cases of people who had drunk water from the pump , or who hadn &apos;t drunk water from the pump .
down the coast here in california , the redwood forest grows to 40 stories tall .
this is a figure from a textbook on underwater sound .
because if you happen to find this one inside your body , you &apos;re in big trouble , because that &apos;s the source code for ebola .
and this isn &apos;t just found in packaging .
now looking at these images , it &apos;s difficult to grasp the scale of this operation , which can already be seen from space and could grow to an area the size of england .
some of you might already know him .
so we really had to think about new , creative ways to flavor , new ways to cook and to change texture — and that was the main issue with this challenge .
even though this wasn &apos;t the direction we went because the crank — it really is stupid to have it on board , by the way .
and that &apos;s to take all the co2 , after you &apos;ve burned it , going out the flue , pressurize it , create a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it stays there .
people want to customize their lives .
so , what technology brought , through the very simple tools like these stone tools here — even something as small as this — the early bands of humans were actually able to eliminate to extinction about 250 megafauna animals in north america when they first arrived 10,000 years ago .
here &apos;s one possibility : basically , countries represent power .
i was a young man who believed that jihad is to be understood in the language of force and violence .
she bought a bright red karmann ghia with the money she made working at burger king .
hope you &apos;re doing well . i &apos;m fine here . everything &apos;s good .
so that is to show that the solar cell acts as a receiver .
( video ) abe davis : three , two , one , go .
i &apos;m supposed to scare you , because it &apos;s about fear , right ?
we &apos;ve taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit so that we &apos;ve made antagonists of the interspecies communication system .
it was 25 minutes of absolute terror that thousands of people across the u.s. felt .
but you know , there is progress being made in places like cambodia and thailand .
and we try to do this for as long as possible .
and it was the same — learning by rote — from primary school through graduate school .
i was so determined to survive that i used my scarf to tie tourniquets around the tops of my legs , and i just shut everything and everyone out , to focus , to listen to myself , to be guided by instinct alone .
but what i &apos;ve learned through speaking with people and writing about these ideas on my website , is that there are some tremendous strengths to being this way .
suddenly , the two common threats that had pushed them closer together throughout decades , more or less evaporated .
is it like gravity , which is the same everywhere in the universe , or there would be all kinds of different biochemistries wherever we find them ?
that &apos;s nice .
and let me give you two examples .
his idea of jihad was a global war of terror , primarily targeted at the far enemy , at the crusaders from the west , against america .
and so what happened — and i think there will probably be some people in the audience that will identify with this — i went to my first meeting , first at the u.n. , and that &apos;s when this all started , because that is a very male organization .
( applause ) bg : thank you . mg : thank you very much .
such hidden biases and black-box algorithms that researchers uncover sometimes but sometimes we don &apos;t know , can have life-altering consequences .
&quot; &quot; let her go , let her go , god bless her wherever she may be she can search this whole wide world all over but she &apos;ll never find another man like me she can search this whole wide world all over and she &apos;ll never find another man like me when i die , please god , bury me in my ten-dollar stetson hat put a twenty-dollar gold piece on my watch chain so my friends know i died standing pat get six gamblers to carry my coffin and six choir girls to sing me a song stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon to raise hell as i go along
it &apos;s small and large . this is an ashtray , a water glass .
there &apos;s two spheres and they &apos;re separated in distance .
this is in the mandara mountains , near the nigerian border in cameroon , mokoulek .
imagine that you &apos;ve been raped and you &apos;re bringing up a boy child .
a third interview was conducted with someone about the north pole .
that &apos;s not going to be changed at all .
thank you very much .
i couldn &apos;t go out and play basketball at recess without feeling like i was going to pass out when i got back inside .
so even though when the powder was poison , the friend drank the coffee and died , people say grace deserves less blame in that case , when she innocently thought it was sugar , than in the other case , where she thought it was poison and no harm occurred .
so netra and i really wanted to use our 200-year plan to curate this digital legacy , and not only digital legacy but we believe in curating the legacy of my past and future .
but i think there &apos;s something really poetic about using nuclear power to propel us to the stars , because the stars are giant fusion reactors .
this is what is killing productivity , what makes people suffer at work .
i challenge each and every one of you to mentor someone different .
now , we &apos;ve gotten to a point where today , the machine understands complex events like down screens and wide pins .
it looks like a car wash . you come into your car wash .
if they &apos;re real boxes , there &apos;s not much we can do , but in a game we can just say , &quot; &quot; right , well .
in infrastructure , let &apos;s just take one example .
it doesn &apos;t need light .
that is all aid can be .
i made a hole in the boundary wall of the slum next to my office , and stuck a computer inside it just to see what would happen if i gave a computer to children who never would have one , didn &apos;t know any english , didn &apos;t know what the internet was .
you need also state ownership , especially of land assets , in order to build and roll out infrastructures very quickly .
that change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift , not only in the fortunes of monterey bay , but other places around the world .
and every single part of this mechanism is actually plausible in biology .
and so you too can type in any word or phrase that you &apos;re interested in and see its n-gram immediately — also browse examples of all the various books in which your n-gram appears .
and seeing what happens , it was ok to generalize , and say , i &apos;m sure that this will happen anytime we make one of these things .
as well as triggering severe loss of memory and mental abilities , the damage to the brain caused by alzheimer &apos;s significantly reduces life expectancy and is always fatal .
there is an invisible beauty all around us , each grain with a story to tell ...
thank you very much .
the rain and the wind will take them off anyway .
( applause )
and it hasn &apos;t been published , so it &apos;s totally privy information just for ted .
a neuron under the microscope is very elegant with little things sticking out and little things over here , but when you start to put them together in a complex system , and you start to see that it becomes a brain , and that brain can create intelligence , what we &apos;re talking about in the body , and cancer is starting to model it like a complex system .
he &apos;s thinking about what he &apos;s got to do to save himself .
( applause ) trans people and trans issues , they &apos;ve been getting a lot of mainstream media attention lately .
here &apos;s sort of the end of that 10 years of work .
thank you . ( applause ) thanks very much . ( applause )
it &apos;s not a matter of teaching it ; in fact , most of the schools tend to discount intuition as an ingredient of your working process because they can &apos;t quantify it : it &apos;s very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design , but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card or a newsletter .
post-white house , he opened an investment firm called generation , where he baked environmental sustainability and other things right into the core investment process .
but anyway , off to the world of ice .
i knew that i might get hacked for giving this talk , so let me save you the effort .
well , somebody had a great idea .
and all the eastern religions except japan had the same level .
guess how much it costs to call rwanda , ghana , nigeria ?
these are going at a relative speed of two meters per second , and this illustrates the basic principle .
the car begins to slide out , dramatic maneuver to correct it , and no change whatsoever in the mental workload .
is our government that generous ? and maybe they are .
now science may dismiss this methodology , but polynesian navigators use it today because it provides them an accurate determination of the angle and direction of their vessel .
but before we get there , we &apos;re engaged in a struggle between good and evil , the good of socialism against the evil of capitalism , and the good shall triumph .
what you &apos;re looking at over here is actually the first unit that i know of of non-human currency .
the best available answer is that they were literally the earliest known works of art , practical tools transformed into captivating aesthetic objects , contemplated both for their elegant shape and their virtuoso craftsmanship .
china also believes that it is being contained by u.s. allies and by those with strategic partnerships with the u.s.
&quot; &quot; because you don &apos;t love us , norman , clearly you &apos;ve chosen your path . &quot; &quot; twenty-four hours later , my social worker , this strange man who used to visit me every couple of months , he &apos;s waiting for me in the car as i say goodbye to my parents .
and just like that , you &apos;ve been seduced into a different way of looking at something because the endorphins have brought down your defenses .
the poor puppy jumps up , you open the dog book , what does it say ?
and actually , they &apos;re very quickly becoming a reality .
anyone who saves a life , saves the life of all humanity .
but they probably don &apos;t think of these opinions as expertise .
no , the fact is , america really is crazy when it comes to drugs .
this may not seem to impress , but technological evolution is progressive , so another 10 , 20,000 years , and armaments technology takes you here .
and we have a school . this is our bright — we opened &#91; in the &#93; last two years &#91; an &#93; elementary school where we have 850 children , and the majority are women and girls .
( laughter ) thank you very much .
and i was always secretly hoping in some part of me that what was being said to me and about me wasn &apos;t ...
every individual starts pushing in one direction and this is what happens .
the connection i have with engineering is the same as any other engineer , in that i love to solve problems .
for example , how a nightlight works , or why an elevator door stays open , or how an ipod responds to touch .
and a good example of this is the rio tinto , which is in portugal .
and the reason this picture &apos;s in here is i did this slide show a couple years ago at a big economics summit , and there was a fellow in the audience who came up to me .
since the age of five , i started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence .
punishment and examinations are seen as threats .
we are so used to doing monologues .
they took pictures of me spread on the police car , and they laughed .
i said , &quot; &quot; and second of all , bad things happen to children every day , and if you didn &apos;t want these retinas , they would probably be buried in the ground right now .
and it &apos;ll be another six billion before that happens , and any remaining life on earth is vaporized .
though , i do know what this means — i think you do too .
so here &apos;s the question : can we grow axons and neurons down these channels ?
basically what it told me was — ( laughter ) ( applause ) — the kinds of countries we prefer are good countries .
the comparisons we make when we are appraising value , where we &apos;re trying to estimate how much we &apos;ll like things , are not the same comparisons we &apos;ll be making when we consume them .
did you know that 68 percent of americans now carry a library card ?
he was making , on average a week , $ 150,000 — tax free of course .
so we got some shows off the ground . we started touring them internationally .
( applause )
thank you .
we can weave them , knit them , or we can make them like you see here .
the first thing that i learned is when you &apos;re holding your breath , you should never move at all ; that wastes energy .
they know , as someone once said , &quot; character &apos;s who you are in the dark . &quot;
and when the land-based ice of the arctic melts , it raises sea level .
because when you go higher , the atmosphere is getting thinner , it &apos;s getting more unstable , the temperature is getting cooler , and you have a lot more u.v. radiation .
and he is one amazing example of what i have experienced all over africa .
so what is a story ?
and in experimental feedings to rodents and ferrets , we found that the animals exhibit symptoms never seen with flu : seizures , central nervous system disorders , partial paralysis .
and , you know , if you think about this with the tsunami , what you have is essentially a kind of an army of local journalists , who are producing enormous amounts of material for no reason other than to tell their stories .
this was really the bastion of the french enlightenment , and this gorgeous illustration was featured as a table of contents for the encyclopedia .
i &apos;m optimistic , because the new machine age is digital , exponential and combinatorial .
but it &apos;s a famous picture , not because of the beauty and majesty of saturn &apos;s rings , but actually because of a tiny , faint blob just hanging underneath one of the rings .
i was ready to tell him , &quot; &quot; listen , if someone such-and-such comes tomorrow , please tell him that it was a mistake .
something i truly believe .
( applause ) and why only computers ? we can just play with papers .
but 60 years of research has demonstrated that separating children from their families and placing them in large institutions seriously harms their health and development , and this is particularly true for young babies .
and i &apos;ve been very supportive until this picture shows up on my facebook page . ( laughter ) and i actually untagged myself first , then i picked up the phone . i said , &quot; &quot; mom , you will never put a picture of me in a bikini ever again . &quot; &quot; and she said , &quot; &quot; why ? you look so cute , darling . &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; you just don &apos;t understand . &quot;
are there any monkeys here ?
he believed that the crystal was the model for all kinds of representation .
he proclaimed his innocence , his family screamed at the jury , his fiancée collapsed on the floor sobbing , and titus is taken away to jail .
but something interesting happened .
most of that money is parked in bank deposits that give you zero percent interest rate .
so , one of these examples would of course be the historic city of venice .
they &apos;re connecting partly , and perhaps even mainly , because they all belong to one body and one brain .
they give rise to the trees , they create the debris fields that feed the mycelium .
you want people to use clean needles — and junkies want to use clean needles .
the teacher &apos;s role is entirely obsolete .
now we have sprawling residential suburbias that are well distinct from production areas and commercial areas .
dad talked a lot about bad design when we were growing up , you know , &quot; &quot; bad design is just people not thinking , john , &quot; &quot; he would say whenever a kid would be injured by a rotary lawn mower or , say , a typewriter ribbon would get tangled or an eggbeater would get jammed in the kitchen .
and if you just go back to the previous image , and you look at this area of volatility and hostility , that a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture could have the affect of bringing all those warring factions together in a united cause , in terms of something that would be genuinely green and productive in the widest sense .
the brain will do more of whatever got that reward .
because ed , like vineet , understands that our role as leaders is to set the stage , not perform on it .
what do we have to get to to achieve the global goals ?
so , these gloves are a little bit small on me , but here it is .
the first is that social connections are really good for us , and that loneliness kills .
astrolabes have an incredible history .
it &apos;s a special kind of material that , when you add water , it will swell up enormously , maybe a thousand times in volume .
learning to play piano for the first time and playing four hands with a friend , or performing a ridiculous skit with friends looking like idiots — things like that .
and so in that sense , i &apos;m much more optimistic about what humans can do .
how is that going to make you feel and what decision might you make next time ?
look at the nuclei . the nuclei in the cell on the left is in the animal , the one on the right is in a dish .
and so the researchers asked themselves , &quot; &quot; i wonder how many times very secure , important , sensitive conversations are happening on these two-way radios where they forget to encrypt and they don &apos;t notice that they didn &apos;t encrypt ? &quot; &quot; so they bought a scanner . these are perfectly legal and they run at the frequency of the p25 , and what they did is they hopped around frequencies and they wrote software to listen in .
so as a result , i decided to open up a private practice , and i became the first foreigner to litigate in afghan courts .
if you want to give some of your own money to punish people who aren &apos;t contributing , you can do that . &quot; &quot; and as soon as people heard about the punishment issue going on , cooperation shoots up .
it also changed our lives in many unexpected ways , and those unexpected ways we later reflected on , that eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us , and a year later , we launched babble , a website for parents .
it &apos;s basically a nuclear-heated torpedo .
one of my mentors in life was norman borlaug , my hero .
this person has never been born .
and the way in which you could think about us as a species and us as a planet had just changed so much , and it was incredibly exciting .
&quot; &quot; what does it matter ? &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; a bullet doesn &apos;t distinguish between a muslim and a christian . &quot; &quot; this small group of women , determined to bring an end to the war , and they chose to use their traditions to make a point : liberian women usually wear lots of jewelry and colorful clothing .
because although she lived across the street they came from different worlds .
you were appointed a social worker .
so we tried to come up with a program — how we could remake this structure to better accommodate ted .
this was a group of eminent economists apologizing to the queen of england when she asked the question , &quot; &quot; why did no one tell us that the crisis was coming ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) i &apos;ll never get my knighthood . i &apos;ll never get my knighthood . ( laughter ) that &apos;s not the important point . the thing you have to remember is , these are eminent economists , some of the smartest people on the planet . do you see the challenge ? ( laughter ) it &apos;s scary . my friend and mentor , tim brown of ideo , he explains that design must get big , and he &apos;s right .
so if you really care about strengthening families , you might want to talk to some liberal groups who are working on promoting educational equality , who are working on raising the minimum wage , who are working on finding ways to stop so many men from being sucked into the criminal justice system and taken out of the marriage market for their whole lives .
it &apos;s really taken off the ground .
( laughter ) sm : i actually did not want to answer this on the ted stage .
so that was the second project .
( applause ) thanks .
really the sahara forest project is a model for how we could create zero-carbon food , abundant renewable energy in some of the most water-stressed parts of the planet as well as reversing desertification in certain areas .
and the second thing , i think , is that the world needs to have people in charge of that .
we have created more wealth in the past decade than ever , but for a majority of americans , their income has fallen .
i grew up diagnosed as phobically shy , and , like at least 20 other people in a room of this size , i was a stutterer .
so basically , metabolism , which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next , has side effects .
i have some news for us creatives .
ss : a year . and why don &apos;t you tell them what happened right before you go run your race ?
it &apos;s easy to not see the forest through the trees .
with this simple tweak , the dance moves from being a dictation to a negotiation .
mrs. lois doery , whom i later came to call my surrogate mum , read me many thousands of hours onto tape .
what &apos;s unexpected about this is that it &apos;s soft , but it &apos;s also a strong magnet .
at no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler . no point .
it turns out the stratosphere has winds that are going in quite different speeds and directions in thin strata .
i can feel your noise .
you start to realize that &quot; &quot; hey , i could go to this live music event and have an utterly transforming experience that will cover my entire body with goosebumps , but it &apos;s more likely that i &apos;ll feel claustrophobic and i won &apos;t be able to get a beer .
here &apos;s their jam aisle .
christopher soghoian : so , it would be funny if it wasn &apos;t true , but , in fact , hacking team &apos;s software is being sold to governments around the world .
the chef had overcooked it .
thank you .
i &apos;ve been doing that for about 10 years .
we kind of see ourselves separate , but we &apos;re very much a part of it .
i really don &apos;t want to just say &quot; &quot; i &apos;m great , &quot; &quot; because that kind of sounds narcissistic , and then i won &apos;t have any friends .
he was about age five .
it &apos;s this crazy idea , that what seems like proof of the camel &apos;s quintessential desert nature could actually be proof of its high arctic past .
or if you take an american reference , to the u.s. capitol building and you pack 3,000 capitol buildings into that block , it would be equivalent to how large that block was .
the vast majority of interactions i see — and i see a lot , believe me — are positive , people reaching out to help or to connect or share information with each other .
but innovation isn &apos;t always incremental .
so he uses a lead that focuses on his shoulder girdle and his arm .
paralysis was an opening for him .
and as i mentioned a moment ago , the core of the capitalist system has been defined by private actors .
it was quite popularly attended .
non-mammalian animals couldn &apos;t do any of those things .
and this is the situation you see .
and we all know that &apos;s from eating too much and not exercising enough , right ?
this star is called kepler-186f .
and besides that , there &apos;s the whole problem of getting the system into the cell in the first place .
why is is this important ?
what do i get there ? &quot; &quot; we get a visual pattern of what these nine-year-olds called acceleration .
so people , for instance , just to gross you out for a second , had cesspools of human waste in their basement . like , a foot to two feet deep .
( applause ) thank you . thank you . ( applause ) thank you .
and peggy phelan reminded me that maybe my brains could be more important than my boobs .
so , here &apos;s the shot .
they have often been rejected by their families , have had bad experiences with medical care and they come to you fully prepared for you to join the long list of people who &apos;s about to disappoint them .
what does that translate to in terms of numbers of films , really ?
and what &apos;s taking place is that the beetle has got a home spot , it goes out on a convoluted path looking for food , and then when it finds food , it heads straight home . it knows exactly where its home is .
we push the pendulum back into the other direction .
what i &apos;m saying is that this is simply the best way to mitigate risk in a foraging context .
and you can not react to injustice , only to forget about it the next day , just because the rest of twitter has moved on .
and i had the usual kind that i think a lot of people had , and that is that , you know , i had expectations placed on me .
but even now , 2011 , there &apos;s still certain cells that we just can &apos;t grow from the patient .
now the brain may not look like much from the outside — a couple pounds of pinkish-gray flesh , amorphous — but the last hundred years of neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain , and to see the intricacy of what lies within .
and i could never really understand exactly what it was , or how it was informing me .
the same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves , but induce immunity against other viruses .
we have no uniform policies regarding quarantine across the united states .
i think that this will result in my surgeries with a better outcome and fewer complications . &quot; &quot; what needs to happen now is further development of our technology along with development of the instrumentation that allows us to see this sort of fluorescence in the operating room .
brad pitt : what if i told you that i wasn &apos;t getting older ...
so imagine if cloe had access to this real-time emotion stream , and she could share it with anybody she wanted to .
and here we are .
so , within six months europe became the epicenter of the money-laundering activities of the world .
namely , the extent to which you have one of these biased time perspectives .
we thought that was a good time to announce it .
there is a basic view that real value involves making things , involves labor . it involves engineering .
the reality is that covering britney is cheaper .
so had the graduate heard the right one word , maybe he would have ended up onstage — oh , i don &apos;t know — maybe with these two .
so , the history of east asia in fact , people don &apos;t think about nations and borders .
as we sail into an uncertain future , we need every form of human intelligence on the planet working together to tackle the challenges that we face as a society .
you already saw the work by tony atala on ted , but this ability to start filling things like inkjet cartridges with cells are allowing us to print skin , organs and a whole series of other body parts .
opens it up and there &apos;s a pearl necklace inside .
now , if i had to draw together all these different experiments in task shifting , and there have of course been many other examples , and try and identify what are the key lessons we can learn that makes for a successful task shifting operation , i have coined this particular acronym , sundar .
that &apos;s the inter-monsoon , the time when the monsoon changes .
and astronomers said , if the earth is moving and we look at a prominent star , let &apos;s say , sirius — well i know i &apos;m in manhattan so you guys can &apos;t see the stars , but imagine you &apos;re out in the country , imagine you chose that rural life — and we look at a star in december , we see that star against the backdrop of distant stars .
that &apos;s why i call for the &quot; &quot; chief detail officer . &quot; &quot; every corporation should have one , and every government should have a ministry of detail .
and he tells us to pay , but we don &apos;t speak english .
and that &apos;s the whole piece .
we &apos;ve started the first malaria treatment programs they &apos;ve ever had there .
dl : she saw fish , dolphins , whales , sharks , and even some sea turtles .
we say it becomes more strongly stratified .
the exciting news is that &apos;s starting to happen .
i became one of the working homeless .
and to build a human , you need three billion of them .
and we saw this guy , haibao .
you can keep sitting here with us .
and here &apos;s this incredibly simple molecule , a nitrogen and an oxygen that are stuck together , and yet these are hugely important for &#91; unclear &#93; our low blood pressure , for neurotransmission , for many , many things , but particularly cardiovascular health .
it &apos;s a story about lemonade .
it &apos;s called bot or not , and you can go and play it for yourselves .
so thanks to these amazing devices , we have been able to gather precious information about tapir reproduction and social organization which are very important pieces of the puzzle when you &apos;re trying to develop those conservation strategies .
and i got three voicemails .
sadly , a temporary weight gain can become permanent .
now , these people making these proclamations to me were not bad people .
( laughter ) and ghosn came up and said , &quot; i have the car , mr. peres ; i will build you the cars . &quot;
we &apos;ve worked on small schools , we &apos;ve funded scholarships , we &apos;ve done things in libraries .
kanzi and panbanisha are stimulated by this fun-filled environment , which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities .
e : ooooowww .
but when he died at the age of 94 , the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him .
our ways of approaching agency and authority turn inside out to reflect the reality that no one has the answers to the challenges facing citizens in this century , and everyone has the responsibility for trying and participating in finding them .
though , for a lot of people , the people who step into slavery today don &apos;t usually get kidnapped or knocked over the head .
because there &apos;s a sport , there &apos;s an activity going on that we &apos;re all aware of , that we condone .
you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s no baby in this photo , because that &apos;s not how this works , not for most working mothers .
i was 27 , and i was home from barcelona , and i was visiting my parents for christmas , and i was cooking dinner with my mother , and we were alone in the kitchen .
we are realizing that this is true .
in fact , the secret police of russia was the creator and instructor of the stasi .
that is the original slide from that year , and it has worked in lockstep obedience .
jn : it &apos;s more tangible than world peace , and it &apos;s certainly more immediate .
more broadly , it &apos;s a cryptocurrency .
let &apos;s talk dirty .
they &apos;re very polite and they don &apos;t get so forward so quickly .
and nike knows how to get your pace and distance from just that sensor .
keep to the track , to the beaten track ; memory holds all you need of the truth .
people in the center , like me , started feeling helpless .
the car is so big , the camera is so small , yet the manual for the camera is so much bigger than the car manual .
or you could actually meet my need .
just smart people moving bits . different rules .
so i had absolutely no idea how that could actually work .
so what we did , we went to alaska , which is where the grizzlies rely on really high , almost inaccessible , mountain slopes for their denning .
number two . number two . two .
i see a lot of very blank faces .
we &apos;ve got plenty of these things .
but i &apos;m teaching them to force that savings habit .
so envision what it looks like all wrapped up .
and also , that was true of the reality of trying to educate me .
the piscivorous fish , the cobia , grouper , amberjacks , those big fish , also the tuna and sharks , are going to hit by this .
so clearly there is some effect .
new technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature ; the nature of what &apos;s happening , showing us our impact on the earth .
number three , please all of the people some of the time .
what this picture suggests to us is that we &apos;ve got a radical change in the way information production and exchange is capitalized . not that it &apos;s become less capital intensive — that there &apos;s less money that &apos;s required — but that the ownership of this capital , the way the capitalization happens , is radically distributed . each of us , in these advanced economies , has one of these , or something rather like it — a computer .
the interesting thing about this climb is it &apos;s not that hard .
so we are creating dylan , which is a computational system with an ambitious goal of taking in visual inputs of the same kind that a human child would receive , and autonomously discovering : what are the objects in this visual input ?
i use it every day to measure the weight of an ox , for example .
and they text back .
they said that only 68 percent of the kids come to school on a regular basis , 100 percent of them live in poverty , only one percent of the parents participate , many of the children come from incarceration and single-parent homes , 39 percent of the students have special needs , and the state data revealed that six percent of the students were proficient in algebra , and 10 were proficient in literature .
and nick , he needs to hold vigil for the relationship .

i would do these things where i &apos;d have students become pens : there &apos;s blue pen , red pen , green pen , black pen .
i know an american researcher who travels frequently in central asia and africa , alone .
and we &apos;re pretty lucky because here in the south , we &apos;re still blessed with a relatively blank canvas that we can fill with the most fanciful adventures and incredible experiences .
well , studies show that even when we &apos;re really trying to pay attention to something — like maybe this talk — at some point , about half of us will drift off into a daydream , or have this urge to check our twitter feed .
and i carry this around as a symbol , really , of the challenge and also the hope .

so here what we did with jean-marie cabelguen is model the spinal cord circuits .
the same incredible imaginations that produced &quot; &quot; the origin of species , &quot; &quot; &quot; jane eyre &quot; and &quot; the remembrance of things past , &quot; also generated intense worries that haunted the adult lives of charles darwin , charlotte brontăť and marcel proust .

being the kind of suspicious person i am , i am outraged at that , and i &apos;m going to pause here , i &apos;m going to pause now and again and bring in different things .
bears fed on it too , and their population began to rise as well , partly also because there were more berries growing on the regenerating shrubs , and the bears reinforced the impact of the wolves by killing some of the calves of the deer .

it was designed by niemeyer in the &apos; 50s .
and with a $ 20 billion price tag , we should simply start and get to work with what we have now and what &apos;s in front of us .
am i safe ?
harmony is the suggestion of something that is embracing and universal and of eternity and of the moment .
my personal belief is that , rather than having a small , elite force of highly trained government agents here to protect us all , we &apos;re much better off having average and ordinary citizens approaching this problem as a group and seeing what we can do .
so we don &apos;t even necessarily have to have direct contact with these organisms to have a very real impact on them .
and i think some dispassionate , quantitative reasoning could really bring a great deal to the debate .
bill gates is in china working with engineers , there &apos;s 40 different companies that are working together to try to race to build the first reactor that runs on waste , that can &apos;t melt down and is cheaper than coal .
do we have any ?
i want a life that &apos;s out of the ordinary .
we started in bermuda for our test project , then moved up to halifax , working down the u.s. east coast , the caribbean sea , the panama canal , through to the galapagos , then across the pacific , and we &apos;re in the process now of working our way across the indian ocean .

keep to the track , to the beaten track ; no-one is waiting and nothing is there .
and then remember , not just one , but two .
it &apos;s what the sociologist sherry turkle calls &quot; &quot; being alone together . &quot; &quot; what we need today is an electoral culture that is about being together together , in person , in loud and passionate ways , so that instead of being &quot; &quot; eat your vegetables &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; do you duty , &quot; &quot; voting can feel more like &quot; &quot; join the club &quot; &quot; or , better yet , &quot; &quot; join the party . &quot; &quot; imagine if we had , across the country right now , in local places but nationwide , a concerted effort to revive a face-to-face set of ways to engage and electioneer : outdoor shows in which candidates and their causes are mocked and praised in broad satirical style ;

what happens when the economy recovers ?
and instead of having one school bell that goes off once , have several smaller school bells that go off in different places and different times , distribute the traffic through the corridors . &quot; &quot; it solves the same problem , but instead of spending several million pounds , you spend several hundred pounds .
what if , rather than airbnb being a $ 25 billion corporation , there was a distributed application on a blockchain , we &apos;ll call it b-airbnb , and it was essentially owned by all of the people who have a room to rent .

now there are two features of mosquito biology that really help us in this project , and that is , firstly , males don &apos;t bite .
but what if we tried to be objective about it ?
now in order to do this — and this brings this group — we have to rethink the notion of capital .
and that &apos;s that all the sensations , feelings , decisions and actions are mediated by the computer in your head called the brain .
what are some recent examples of innovations that combine creative design and technological advances in a way so profound that they will be remembered a thousand years from now ?
and it was a physiological response .
that &apos;s right .
jh : so what all of these cases have in common is that the self seems to thin out , or melt away , and it feels good , it feels really good , in a way totally unlike anything we feel in our normal lives .
it tracks your movement through space .
after telling ourselves for so long that our tools and technology can control nature , suddenly we were face-to-face with our weakness , with our lack of control , as the oil burst out of every attempt to contain it — &quot; top hats , &quot; &quot; top kills &quot; and , most memorably , the &quot; &quot; junk shot &quot; &quot; — the bright idea of firing old tires and golf balls down that hole in the world .

winston churchill came to my home of mit in 1949 , and he said , &quot; &quot; if we are to bring the broad masses of the people in every land to the table of abundance , it can only be by the tireless improvement of all of our means of technical production . &quot; &quot; abraham lincoln realized there was one other ingredient .

the problem is , if you buy a $ 40,000 incubator , and you send it off to a mid-sized village in africa , it will work great for a year or two years , and then something will go wrong and it will break , and it will remain broken forever , because you don &apos;t have a whole system of spare parts , and you don &apos;t have the on-the-ground expertise to fix this $ 40,000 piece of equipment .

the rest of the collection remains here , stored in plain brown paper bags until funds can be raised to build a permanent museum and study center .
and the question is : will it make a difference ?
and it explains the vast right-wing conspiracy that &apos;s obviously developed around these licenses , as now more than 350 million digital objects are out there , licensed freely in this way .
i &apos;m alive .
here are two of them .
have sweet dream . &quot; &quot; i didn &apos;t know what to say !
but your health decisions are the same .
so why should you care about that ?
if the higgs field were only a few times more intense , we would see atoms shrinking , neutrons decaying inside atomic nuclei , nuclei disintegrating , and hydrogen would be the only possible chemical element in the universe .
it doesn &apos;t do it with a chemical .
i visited the site many times , and everybody , kind of — you can see this from two kilometers away ; it &apos;s an exact center of the street , and the whole notion is to engage the public , to engage buildings as part of the public tissue of the city .
it was the beginning of a change .
but in my world , it &apos;s called reduced obesity and diabetes .
it can improve health and it can play a part in reducing , if not eliminating , poverty .
each sand grain is about a tenth of a millimeter in size .
so i drove . i posted a video on youtube .
they cannot feed their offspring , their children , their breast milk because of the accumulation of these toxins in their food chain , in their part of the world &apos;s ocean pyramid .
i &apos;m very happy to be here in india .
interestingly enough , other neurologic diseases which affect very different parts of the brain also show tangles of misfolded protein , which suggests that the approach might be a general one , and might be used to cure many neurologic diseases , not just alzheimer ’ s disease .
i &apos;m doing weight-bearing exercise , so that i have the muscle strength so that when i start to wither , i have more time that i can still move around .
there &apos;s a company called apex , a no-name chinese firm , who has , several times in the past year , been the number-one dvd seller in america . their average price , for last year , was 48 dollars .
thank you .

and i think it &apos;s wrong , actually .
later in burma , i came across rohingya fighters , who were barely teenagers , born and brought up in the jungle , carrying machine guns and grenade launchers .
at best , he thought , it had to have been a hallucination — a trick of the eye or the ear , perhaps , or his own mind working against him .
this is my tattoo .
notice that there are only some objects that he can see , whereas there are many more objects that you can see .
most of the globe experiences the state as repressive , as an organization that is concerned about denial of rights , about denial of justice , rather than provision of it .
in the 1960s , before marion was home to the cmu , it was home to the notorious control unit .
and i understood that could also represent the rift between one generation and the next , between people like me and my father &apos;s generation , but there &apos;s no tradition in caribbean life of memoirs or biographies .
thanks to modern technology , the government knows far too much about what happens behind closed doors .
and they also found four species of bats in there .
and look now , the first african countries here are coming in .
( laughter ) but if we rearrange this formula quickly , we can get to acceleration equals force over mass , which means that for a larger particle — a larger mass — it requires more force to change its direction .
for example , pumps , the biggest use of motors , move liquid through pipes .
( laughter ) so , a little tether coming off , it &apos;s just a control for the fur &apos;s mouth and his eyes .
the gut is actually the largest immune system , defending your body .
well the answer is , if i drew it on a normal curve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that i &apos;m trying to graph , the graphs look sort of silly .
and then the clouds came over us , and then , boom ! this massive thunderclap , and sheets of rain .
mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow , and everywhere that mary went , the lamb was sure to go .
when i finished , i went to the ituri forest for my internship .
even in newfoundland where we used to catch cod , we now have a jellyfish fishery .
this is the best you can get in hyderabad in indian education .
this stuff is produced biologically .
they have one of the highest literacy rates in latin america and in the world .
and so if we do nothing to address the digital security divide , if we do nothing to ensure that everyone in our society gets the same benefits of encryption and is equally able to protect themselves from surveillance by the state , not only will the poor and vulnerable be exposed to surveillance , but future civil rights movements may be crushed before they ever reach their full potential .
actually , this isn &apos;t as crazy an idea as it seems , and i &apos;m currently exploring it .
this is how most work today .
it reduces earth &apos;s heat radiation to space , so there &apos;s a temporary energy imbalance .
but what if i could make an instrument that could be adapted to the way i personally behave , to the way my hands work , to what i do very skillfully , perhaps , to what i don &apos;t do so skillfully ?
and together we got through the eye of the financial storm in iceland without taking any direct losses to our equity or to the funds of our clients .
for answers to these questions , it starts with individuals , and i think peer-to-peer security is the answer .
and maybe these healing zones can start growing , and possibly even overlap , and good things can happen .
i guess you won &apos;t be surprised if i tell you that pinocchio is one of my great influences .
and we go to live concerts , and we get that as much as we can .
so you really needed something on your wrist to tell you : what time is it on the earth ? what time is it on mars ?
in that moment , our scholarship can tell you that this is a bacchanal , but if we &apos;re doing our job right , and you &apos;ve checked the jargon at the front door , trust your instinct .
i had really misunderstood the technology .
thank you .
the latest effort to tame malaria started in the late 1990s .
&quot; &quot; i don &apos;t understand . soybeans ?
and if you did , you are forgiven for wondering how a nutt managed to end up in a war zone .
it &apos;s about landscape , it &apos;s about street photography , it &apos;s about color , it &apos;s about architecture , perspective , scale — and , especially , history .
please join us by working together .
now we could compute something related to this , let &apos;s say ... the gdp of spain divided by , i don &apos;t know , the — hmmm ...
you can &apos;t find oiled penguins in argentina .
( laughter ) wonderful news .
it &apos;s a shame we carry .
it &apos;s about design thinking where you have that interesting combination of the scientific method and the artistic process .
it &apos;s just one year of data , but you can see how dynamic the southern ocean is .
and this had to do with the ambitions of the leadership .
she says she first got started with 10 packets of bindis , and then wondered what she could do with 10 thousand .
but each of these three objects has value above and beyond what it can do for you based on its history .
so again , this is 2005 .
not only that , because you have this convection , you have this rising of the air where it &apos;s hot , air is drawn in .
do we want our car to perhaps be a partner , a coach , someone that can use their understanding of the situation to help us reach our potential ?
but we &apos;re going through the haystack no longer with a teaspoon but with a skip loader , because of this increase in speed .
and such skeptics can find comfort in the fourth kind of immortality story , and that is legacy , the idea that you can live on through the echo you leave in the world , like the great greek warrior achilles , who sacrificed his life fighting at troy so that he might win immortal fame .
and this , in essence , is what &apos;s known as the friendship paradox .
and it gets bored , so it will then look away at something else .
a second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream .
so i posed as a teacher and a missionary at an all-male university in pyongyang .
and it was a device that , in fact , is a model of the sky .
okay , good .
it can be music , it can be opera , it can be a theater piece , it can be film , it can be video dance .
( laughter ) so the second story that i &apos;d like to tell is , actually starts in my own house .
unfortunately the other drivers next to us were not paying as much attention .
when someone hands an object to you , you can read intention in their eyes , their face , their body language .
so this is a series i &apos;m hoping to have ready in about two or three years , under the heading of &quot; &quot; the oil party . &quot; &quot; because i think everything that we &apos;re involved in — our clothing , our cars , our roads , and everything — are directly a result .
should we worry . no , we shouldn &apos;t worry .
now , that is sufficiently zany that we would , obviously , jump to the bait , and we did .
( laughter ) but it &apos;s when you put all of these elements together — when you get the viral appeal of a great joke with a powerful punchline that &apos;s crafted from honesty and integrity , it can have a real world impact at changing a conversation .
in the developing countries of the world , this gap is even larger .
faizan peerzada and the rafi peer theatre workshop named for his father have for years promoted the performing arts in pakistan .
and none of this pin stuff would have happened if it hadn &apos;t been for saddam hussein .
( audience : once on purpose ! ) dh : how about if i try first and then decide ?
there was no road map . no one had ever done anything like this before .
and that directly connects to ideas of city-making .
of course , you couldn &apos;t have done that all alone .
( laughter ) now , that might sound pretty good , but ask yourself what would happen under our current economic and political order ?
and even though mount chimborazo isn &apos;t the tallest mountain in the andes , it &apos;s one degree away from the equator , it &apos;s riding that bulge , and so the summit of chimborazo is the farthest point on earth from the center of the earth .
there are other barriers brought about by our laws .
so we think that there is something interesting we can do here .
we can &apos;t travel everywhere .
the big point for me was not being alone and having 10 , maybe 100 people being involved — that was a big point .
and he knows when he comes home , even if it &apos;s to talk about the speech he did or the data or what he &apos;s learned , i &apos;m really interested , and i think we have a really collaborative relationship .
what the nigerian writer chinua achebe calls &quot; &quot; a balance of stories . &quot; &quot; what if my roommate knew about my nigerian publisher , muhtar bakare , a remarkable man who left his job in a bank to follow his dream and start a publishing house ?
and so , to try to persuade you of how totally amazing , excellent and relevant mathematics is , i want to give you my top three mathematically verifiable tips for love .
and then this is a film , on the lower left , that charles and ray made .
&quot; &quot; i wish i &apos;d led a life true to my dreams , and not what others expected of me . &quot; &quot; are games doing this yet ?
best of all , i &apos;m healthier , i know that i &apos;m going to live longer , and i &apos;ve even lost a little weight .
and we &apos;re surrounded by natural light and organic elements .
that &apos;s the stigma , because unfortunately , we live in a world where if you break your arm , everyone runs over to sign your cast , but if you tell people you &apos;re depressed , everyone runs the other way .
community meeting houses are places where there &apos;s very specific relationships between people , like this one in mali , where the elders gather .
it is a statement made by the current front-runner for the republican nomination for us president , donald trump .
so about 10 years of internal evaluation , testing , to get this to a state where we think it &apos;s actually ready .
of course they have to look through a bloody camera in a museum . right ? that &apos;s how museums are working today .
instead of having vaclav smil &apos;s &quot; &quot; massively fatal discontinuity &quot; &quot; of life , we can ensure the continuity of life .
and in the next couple of weeks , she &apos;s going to be among the first 200 families to move into this development .
and what &apos;s interesting is that the salamander has kept a very primitive circuit , which is very similar to the one we find in the lamprey , this primitive eel-like fish , and it looks like during evolution , new neural oscillators have been added to control the limbs , to do the leg locomotion .
and we looked in the literature , and nothing was known about this shark &apos;s vision .
ca : because everyone could see that .
so they get tired , has come dark and rain ; they get weary and tired .
but the other motivating factor is the insular nature of our country .
the wild thing about that trial also , was that it reduced new primaries , so new cancers , by 30 percent also .
i really am worried . wow , there &apos;s so much anxiety . &quot; &quot; and before we know it , right , we &apos;re anxious about feeling anxious .
you have more data .
and that &apos;s something that each and every citizen and voter needs to ask themselves .
they are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters .
make of that what you will .
this assessment , unfortunately , is far too optimistic .
i &apos;m not talking about science that takes baby steps .
and they &apos;re investing in energy .
and is that life still there ?
we &apos;ve got to engage , we &apos;ve got to educate , and we &apos;ve got to have dialogue .
it &apos;s difficult . 2011 , 2013 . freedom tower , the memorial .
if you lose a lot of weight , your brain reacts as if you were starving , and whether you started out fat or thin , your brain &apos;s response is exactly the same .
and then , in the same year , we almost lost everything .
but with this experiment , we &apos;ve confined that same mass to a much smaller volume that &apos;s 10,000 times smaller .
deworming .
i was angry , i was bitter , and all i wanted was revenge .
he &apos;s working the leg .
the rice in the cereal that many of us fed our babies was developed using this approach .
we call it omega , which is an acronym for offshore membrane enclosures for growing algae .
and that costs on average under 18 dollars a barrel .
as i had no reference point for my body , i began to ask other women about their bodies — in particular , their vaginas , because i thought vaginas were kind of important .
so we were pretty reassured by this .
it used to be very time-consuming , but now it &apos;s nothing .
cities are doing this , but not just one by one .
you guys , according to the rules , are legendary grandmasters , so congratulations .
so that means that we can have some form of self-replication .
here &apos;s one more secret for you : shaking someone &apos;s hand for six seconds dramatically raises the level of oxytocin in your bloodstream , now that &apos;s the trust hormone .
what we decided to do is first look for those ingredients for life .
every year , 60,000 people are newly diagnosed with parkinson &apos;s , and this number is only rising .
and there &apos;s a generation out there that &apos;s grown up on the internet , and they know that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to architect the systems the right way .
the typical post-conflict government is so short of money that it needs our money just to be on a life-support system .
you &apos;re going to have a busy lunchtime rush .
and very quickly , some letters started coming back .
however , although it &apos;s very , very sad this news , it &apos;s also thanks to their personal stories that we have raised awareness of how lethal this disease can be .
but what housman understood , and you hear it in the symphonies of nielsen too , was that the long , hot , silvan summers of stability of the 19th century were coming to a close , and that we were about to move into one of those terrifying periods of history when power changes .
what we &apos;re talking here is not about a sexual revolution , but a sexual evolution , learning from other parts of the world , adapting to local conditions , forging our own path , not following one blazed by another .
infection in india .
just over 30 years ago , the nations of the world assembled at alma-ata and made this iconic declaration .
now let &apos;s imagine that you were an economist in 1929 , trying to forecast future growth for the united states , not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff , not knowing that we were about to enter the greatest economic disaster certainly in the 20th century .
one of my senior colleagues told me , when i was a youngster in this profession , rather proudly , that statisticians were people who liked figures but didn &apos;t have the personality skills to become accountants . ( laughter )
and a fifth symmetry , i can rotate it by five sixths of a turn .
after all , it seems to be dull and abstract , just numbers and computations and rules to apply .
and i expected them to put a ruler next to the wall , size it up with a finger , and make an estimate of the height .
i am a hazara , and the homeland of my people is afghanistan .
what i want you all to do right now is to think of this mammal that i &apos;m going to describe to you .
after that , it had to be kneaded . it had to then go in , kind of , a mangle .
now , i found the answer very quickly .
bg : i am sure that many people here are wondering about your experience as the finance minister of greece earlier this year .
it is about our own commitment to human rights .
let &apos;s look at the next year , and you can see that that trend is continuing .
we will celebrate 218 representatives in the house and 60 senators in the united states senate who have committed to this idea of fundamental reform .
and hold it there , both of you .
what might possibly happen ?
and they &apos;d been working on furniture before .
and as that happens , the heating that we find from the sun is going to become very intense .
so if we think about an extreme weather event that might happen in some part of the world , and if that happens in a part of the world where there is good infrastructure , where there are people that are well-insured and so on , then that impact can be disruptive .
this dynamic data allows farmers to optimize use of water energy while improving quality of the products and the yields , which is a great solution for california , which faces major water shortage .
indeed , this is kind of like the sesame street game of &quot; &quot; which thing doesn &apos;t belong ? &quot; &quot; and you &apos;re right to say it &apos;s the swimming pool that doesn &apos;t belong , because the swimming pool is the only thing on this slide that &apos;s actually very dangerous .
the temperature at the surface is some 350 degrees below zero fahrenheit .
so it kind of was sending a message that only girls are supposed to cook ; boys aren &apos;t .
you were separated from your family by the state .
&quot; &quot; what is life ? &quot; &quot; is something that i think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels .
it &apos;s a natural anti-inflammatory .
we have , actually , a pretty good working definition of complexity .
that &apos;s one of the most profound insights to come out of the historical study of complex institutions like civilizations .
hey , we live in a very noxious world .
so the first question is , why do we need to even worry about a pandemic threat ?
a wise person knows when to improvise .
all those years , all those books , he never got tired of it .
if you put an anti-malarial gene drive in just 1 percent of anopheles mosquitoes , the species that transmits malaria , researchers estimate that it would spread to the entire population in a year .
now , visual thinking was a tremendous asset in my work designing cattle-handling facilities .
they would put 50 pounds of weight on their backs , and board the helicopter for an operation , and they would come back and watch a movie called &quot; &quot; bridesmaids . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) they even wore a thing called spanx , because , as they found very quickly , the uniforms made for men were big where they should be small , and small where they should be big .
this is one piece of good news .
and what we find when we do that is always the same .
now there &apos;s a project that i &apos;m initiating at the moment that i &apos;m very excited about and wanted to share with you , because it is all about changing perceptions , and , indeed , building a new level of trust .
i had frostbite in my left big toe .
my right knee was swollen up , and you could hear that ominous crunch of bone against bone .
to me the real , real solution to quality growth is figuring out the balance between two activities : exploration and exploitation .
there could be all sorts of medical interventions .
let me tell you , it has been a fantastic month for deception .
he was in the hospital for a week , shaking with chills , dehydrated and delirious , sinking into a coma as his organs failed .
but the small animals that eat insects are being eaten by larger animals , still larger animals .
human time , industrial time , tested against the time of the tides , in which these memories of a particular body , that could be any body , multiplied as in the time of mechanical reproduction , many times , placed over three square miles , a mile out to sea , disappearing , in different conditions of day and night .
just remember that single acne spot that crippled you for several days .
this is marie saylee , nine months old .
and every now and then , we do something like a , you know , an automated hair wrap machine , you know , that tangles your hair and pulls your scalp out , and — and we &apos;d make some money on that , you know . and we &apos;d give it out .
this year , i got , what i really have to say is a rather brilliant idea , to laser cut my valentines out of used christmas cards .
paul debevec : so , if we break that down into layers , here &apos;s that diffuse component we saw in the first slide .
and how many previous times do you think they &apos;ve been in prison ?
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s truly possible to express in words what it &apos;s like not to be able to communicate .
that &apos;s 3.2 billion people .
this is something i did for sony in 1996 .
it &apos;s much easier and more lucrative to market a technological fix for these gaps in health than to deal with the structural inequities that produce them .
and we try to test whether actually assisting your imagination by looking at the face of your future self can change you investment behavior .
and the good side of that is that we can be a part of the solution .
so we need to find smarter , more systems-based , innovative solutions to these problems , if we &apos;re going to start to live sustainably within this world .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether or not it means not doing all the work i assign and not getting a good grade in my courses .
people on the east coast in 1849 , when they first started to get the news , they thought , &quot; &quot; ah , this isn &apos;t real . &quot; &quot; but they keep hearing about people getting rich , and then in 1850 they still hear that . and they think it &apos;s not real .
why ? because as your attention shifts to your cell phone , you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly to the car braking in front of you , and so you &apos;re much more likely to get engaged into a car accident .
but the materiality matters too , because in every society that anthropologists have looked at , material stuff operates as a kind of language — a language of goods , a symbolic language that we use to tell each other stories — stories , for example , about how important we are .
( applause ) they also stay in their jobs 15 percent longer , by the way .
if you open any cell of the matrix , you find another 20-dimensional matrix .
there are nine billion humans coming our way .
for example , this &quot; &quot; citizens united &quot; &quot; ruling is a disaster , because it means there &apos;s like a money gun aimed at your head , and if you step out of line , if you try to reach across the aisle , there &apos;s a ton of money waiting to be given to your opponent to make everybody think that you are a terrible person through negative advertising .
but anyway , for some reason , i promised myself that i wasn &apos;t going to move , that i was going to do this thing that mummy wanted me to do .
it looks like a beautiful photograph .
( laughter ) and just as he &apos;s writing , you know , bacteria that will be smaller , he &apos;s writing genomes that will work , we could write smaller programs that would do what microsoft word does .
or , you know , vib-ribbon was not distributed here in the united states .
so then i said , &quot; &quot; nets , what do i do ? &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; why don &apos;t you send me your paintings ?
the best collaboration , of course , is with children .
my colleagues at johns hopkins were among the best .
this temporarily effectively banned autonomous weapons in the u.s. military , but that directive needs to be made permanent .
you get damaged wiring .
perhaps you &apos;ve been at home for a week on your own .
odysseus would have said , &quot; &quot; okay , let &apos;s do a dry run .
we turn on the faucet , the water comes out , we assume it &apos;s safe , and we assume that we are masters of our environment , rather than being part of it .
now , usually , when international audiences hear about that part of the world , they often just want that conflict to go away .
you can get another angle on danny &apos;s porch by going around to the south and looking north at the whole formation there .
the last component is the operating system that manages the whole network .
who i am really doesn &apos;t matter at all .
and it &apos;s been an incredible experience .
and after six months , the nerves grew in well , and you could see strong contractions .
we were the best that they could do .
decades later and dozens of countries from all around the world have launched thousands of more satellites into orbit , and the frequency of launches is only going to increase in the future , especially if you consider things like the possibility of 900-plus satellite constellations being launched .
he tried the marketing solution , which is he declared the potato as a royal vegetable , and none but the royal family could consume it .
if you google regret and tattoo , you will get 11.5 million hits .
the second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers-on .
yes , for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today , but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage , prostitution , forced labor — they have children that they don &apos;t want or they cannot feed .
it flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins , gets lift , powers its movements with a lunate tail .
and then the third part is , what are the potential problems , or the dark side of blogs as we know them ?
in a world with no systems , with chaos , everything becomes a guerilla struggle , and this predictability is not there .
it &apos;s this hair that &apos;s above the eyes , and below it , it &apos;s longer .
tr : right , so this is less than a $ 1,000 solution .
there are great things being done there , treating now autism , dementia and other conditions .
and we contrast that to the other way , an invention that happened after the second world war , suburban sprawl , clearly not compact , clearly not diverse , and it &apos;s not walkable , because so few of the streets connect , that those streets that do connect become overburdened , and you wouldn &apos;t let your kid out on them .
and for the first time , i started to think about how we made decisions .
time for some thermodynamics .
the answer is what i call &quot; &quot; ancient food miles . &quot; &quot; basically , rome had access to the sea , which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away .
so i want to talk to you about two things tonight .
and what we gain with a new technology , of course , is precision and accuracy .
the hit delivered by — david camarillo : sorry , three times is probably a little excessive there .
if you raise questions about that formulation , you really are considered a bit of an antique .
we &apos;re not even slowing down .
perhaps we are not at a stage in africa where many actors and small enterprises leads to growth through competition .
delivering the power and the bandwidth into the ocean will dramatically accelerate adaptation .
it &apos;s not something you want to put on your facebook page , right ?
so for example , we would put models under an artificial sky .
and then he had to clarify that he wasn &apos;t talking about them .
they &apos;re watching their own brain activation , and they &apos;re controlling the pathway that produces their pain .
that ended the discussion .
you know what ? six of those seven voted yes in favor of the bill , so it passed , and it passed by a vote of 47 to 32 .
especially if you breathe air , it &apos;s very hard to get from planet a to planet b , because there &apos;s no air in between . but if you breathe air — ( laughter ) — you &apos;re dead — ( laughter ) — as soon as you &apos;re off the planet , unless you have a spaceship .
and our translation of that , using a lot of the thinking built up over the 40 years , is to say , what if that , instead of being just a pipe , what if it is a lifeline ?
and when we met him he was very resistant .
it was like leaving our mark on society , to say , &quot; &quot; i was here , &quot; &quot; on the top of a building .
we believe in thinking differently .
we wanted to go tackle this problem in a very different direction .
but barbecue &apos;s interesting , because it &apos;s one of these cult foods like chili , or bouillabaisse .
because i can &apos;t explain otherwise , when i look at the figures , what &apos;s going on .
fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us .
and so we had our first meeting , after three months , in tiburon , which is just up the road from here — you know tiburon ?
so , that &apos;s how it walks . but when you look at us human being , bipedal walking , what you &apos;re doing is you &apos;re not really using a muscle to lift your leg and walk like a robot . right ?
well , the argument in &quot; &quot; the blank slate &quot; &quot; was that elite art and criticism in the 20th century , although not the arts in general , have disdained beauty , pleasure , clarity , insight and style .
designing .
and he tried to get their opinions on his patients .
europe had to be dragged into economic development .
and i figured , this has to stop .
so one of them was fairly straightforward .
not that there &apos;s a lot of competition , right ?
and we split these bridges .
in other words , the beer-maker knows also how to evoke flavor from the grains by using sprouting and malting and roasting .
let me give you an example of what i mean by harmless but taboo sexual practice . we gave them scenarios .
and the most immediate thought when i came out of that water was the following : i &apos;m never , ever going to do another cold water swim in my life again .
but no .
i was actually crying during his presentation .
&#91; &quot; &quot; yellow &quot; &quot; &#93; db : red . audience : yellow .
and here &apos;s the resulting data that comes from that , the model that comes from that .
the episode of &quot; &quot; star trek &quot; &quot; for me was james daly played methuselah — remember this one ?
and we started to realize that it could never be and never should have been us versus them .
you can take them out of the vertebrate skeleton , you can culture them in petri dishes in the laboratory , and they are dying to form cartilage .
and he admitted to me that he was perplexed by their success .
( applause )
and also , make it socially acceptable that we change our minds , or probably even reward that ?

we can inject these dyes into the bloodstream , so that when we do a new vessel and we bypass a blockage on the heart , we can see if we actually made the connection , before we close that patient back up again — something that we haven &apos;t been able to do without radiation before .
this one &apos;s mine , and i think you would really like her .
perhaps it &apos;s never been more important at any time in our lifetimes .
135 million-plus people . think about that .
ca : a lot of people look at the hedge fund industry now and are sort of ... shocked by it , by how much wealth is created there , and how much talent is going into it .
the disease was so terrifying that the president of the united states launched an extraordinary national effort to find a way to stop it .
it was the government that made law function finally .

and after a couple very liberating weekends , my wife and i , utilizing some cutting-edge erectile technology that is certainly worthy of a tedtalk someday but i won &apos;t get into it now , we noticed some familiar , if unexpected , symptoms .
what &apos;s really at stake perhaps here is not the medicine itself but a metaphor .
and then , we don &apos;t have a stuffed spinoza , but we do have a stuffed pavlov &apos;s dog , and i visited him in the museum of hygiene in st. petersburg , in russia .

almost two years ago , i was driving in my car in germany , and i turned on the radio .
it wasn &apos;t really what people needed .

it &apos;s the power of focus .
because of the earth tilting on its axis and those catastrophic climate shifts , we had to figure out how to find better food , and we had to learn — there &apos;s lucy ; that &apos;s how we all began — we had to learn how to crack open animal bones , use tools to do that , to feed on the marrow , to grow our brains more .
but watch its front legs . can you see what they are doing ?
that &apos;s what people thought .

some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin , and it went around sort of creating its little dna information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because bacteria communicate .

the climate news , i &apos;m sorry to say , is going to keep getting worse than we think , faster than we think .

but it doesn &apos;t sound so much , it &apos;s not relatively enough , it won &apos;t make a difference if you &apos;ve already committed 100,000 soldiers previously .
so what we need is something that doesn &apos;t necessarily have to have the performance of the internet , but the police department has to be able to call up the fire department even without the internet , or the hospitals have to order fuel oil .
we &apos;ve learned over time that stars have individual histories ; that is , they have birth , they have middle ages and some of them even have dramatic deaths .
it &apos;s a story about this woman , natalia rybczynski .
that never changes .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are triumphs of the scientific method .
here is steve jobs introducing multi-touch and making a rather foreboding joke .
and so even though mars has an atmosphere , we can see it &apos;s much thinner than the earth &apos;s .
i was thinking that i shouldn &apos;t go because somebody said , if i did , it would show that i approved of the military regime there .
so one example of this that has big resonance in the policy realm is how this plays out on our very real war of ideas that we &apos;re fighting against radical groups .
( laughter ) so ...
so a lot of what we see in the mesh , and a lot of what we have in the platform that we built allows us to define , refine and scale .
we &apos;re trying to design new scenarios for space that have fully reconfigurable and self-assembly structures that can go from highly functional systems from one to another .

well , if you remember before world war ii , japan had a vision for a greater japanese co-prosperity sphere .
and every kid , you know , as a teenager , has got his bedroom he retreats to — but i wanted my door , i thought it would be cool if my door went up rather than opened , like on star trek .
it is a user-appropriate technology that has been used for humanitarian good to great effect .
and this shows that engineers , medical people , scientific people , have an obsession with solving the problems of reality , when actually most problems , once you reach a basic level of wealth in society , most problems are actually problems of perception .
orient your loop this way .
i guess people don &apos;t talk to their uber drivers .
he touches his food , it turns into gold .
people aren &apos;t close or distant .
i &apos;m connected to 80,000 people around the world , and that &apos;s four madison square gardens full of cousins .

and we can create those positive peer-to-peer relationships on and offline , we can support and educate the next generation of hackers , like myself , instead of saying , &quot; &quot; you can either be a criminal or join the nsa . &quot; &quot; that matters today .
however , we were sneaky , and we proposed more : to convert riverbanks into pedestrian pathways , and then to connect these pathways back to the city fabric , and finally to convert the urban voids along the riverbanks into public spaces that are lacking in the medina of fez .
so we have to do something that &apos;s a little bit more intelligent than doing this .
so here we can see the white represents low altitudes , and the blue are higher altitudes .
it became the media .
and what you can see here is the beginning of an industry in a test tube , a mining industry that is in harmony with nature .
we &apos;ve lots of blood vessels in there .

so returning to the droplet , again , thinking about the universe in a new way .
have a go : poem 1 : little fly / thy summer &apos;s play , / my thoughtless hand / has brush &apos;d away .
so she said to us , &quot; &quot; look , i &apos;ve been heading this department for the last two years .
so , that &apos;s just one use . incredible , there is probably 350 , 400 uses .

the plaque reads , &quot; &quot; albert einstein lived here . &quot; &quot; and i &apos;d like to end with a vignette , as it were , inspired by this image .
they find me up on the top terrace .
sp : if you let fear get to you , then you &apos;re not going to be doing your job .
( laughter ) now , if you think about that story for a moment , i think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in .
and , of course , they &apos;re basically extinct now .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about today is a device that we &apos;ve been working on that i think has the potential to make a difference , to be much more effective , and what i wanted to do is show you how it works . okay , so let me back up a little bit and show you how a normal retina works first so you can see the problem that we were trying to solve .
our goal for robotics is to unlock everyone &apos;s mental power by making the world more physically accessible to people such as myself and others like me around the globe .
now , a specific thing for this particular version of the project is that i &apos;m very interested to see how we can connect with the local population , the native population .
now , you don &apos;t find any kund ; they are all submerged .
and i think what this leads to is a very simple recognition , that there &apos;s one question in politics at the moment above all other , and it &apos;s this one : how do we make things better without spending more money ?
would the good microbes do battle with the bad microbes and help to restore their health ?
and most of all , he would teach it .
i &apos;m going to focus on scientists and engineers because i have some data on that , and i &apos;m a data person .
how can the bible be so barbaric in some places , and yet so incredibly wise in others ?
( laughter ) hello ! ( laughter )
my lady , it is my husband &apos;s child .
what they do now is : they can grow crops in the rainy season but they can &apos;t grow them in the off-season .
we cherish the opportunity to have our say , to help decide the future of the country .
but consider a same-sex couple like my friends sarah and emily .
as a result , we &apos;re tuned in to the subtlest things that could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering , in order to believe whether these things are realistic .
it &apos;s commonly reported in ukraine that children , when leaving the orphanage are targeted for human trafficking , child pornography and prostitution .
i will take enough of these . mm .
i was the kind of religious where i heard parents tell children when they &apos;re leaving on a two-year proselytizing mission that they would rather have them die than return home without honor , having sinned .
and i want you to see , this is fuku , a young female , and she is quietly playing with water .
but you get these resources together .
we are running late .
because it &apos;s only when you do that , that you can talk about — ( laughter ) — it &apos;s only when you do that , &#91; that &#93; you can talk about how we looked like and how we behaved at different times , and how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time .
before they went through the social stress test , they were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful .
as : what this scene is doing , and it did in the book , is it &apos;s fundamentally making a promise .
( laughter ) we &apos;re hardwired to become leaders of the pack .
we need , especially in technology , we need revolutionary change , not incremental change .
ss : so , then aimee makes it to the 1996 paralympics , and she &apos;s all excited . her family &apos;s coming down — it &apos;s a big deal .
and it &apos;s sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to california in the hope of getting happier .
he types &quot; &quot; opossum &quot; &quot; into this official knowledge base .
my passions are music , technology and making things .
lp : how on earth did we do that ?
we spend so much time talking past each other and not enough time talking through our disagreements , and if we can start to find compassion for one another , then we have a shot at building common ground .
people were expecting me to talk about my beloved sydney swans football team .
if estimates are correct that about one to two percent of all suicides involves the murder of another person , when suicide rates rise , as they are rising for some populations , the murder-suicide rates will rise as well .

hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery .
so we &apos;re able to do the simulation , but this is two days on a desktop .
in our fuel cells , we do it with platinum ; life does it with a very , very common iron .
another thing you can try , is switching from active communication and collaboration , which is like face-to-face stuff — tapping people on the shoulder , saying hi to them , having meetings , and replace that with more passive models of communication , using things like email and instant messaging , or collaboration products , things like that .
and that happened because this one person had a documentary instinct , which was to post a status update , which is what we all do now , so if something happens , we put our status update , or we post a photo , we post a video , and it all goes up into the cloud in a constant stream .
so we talked for a few minutes , and he said , &quot; why don &apos;t you tell them what you believe ? &quot;
fission .
eighty percent of the people in the world have no food safety net .
it extracts regions with dark contrast , which will show up on the video as red .
so that got our attention , and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with stuxnet and checked this thing out .
the moral of this story is all these narratives about rise and fall and decline tell us a lot more about psychology than they do about reality .
we cannot afford to be color blind .
( music ) on memorial day , we released &quot; &quot; the national mall , &quot; &quot; a location-aware album released exclusively as a mobile app that uses the device &apos;s built-in gps functionality to sonically map the entire park in our hometown of washington , d.c.
they bring it back and feed it to the larvae .
and we &apos;re getting this mass-manufactured .
the u.n. broadband commission has recently set targets to help broadband access in 50 percent of the developing world , compared to 20 percent today .

a nice visual composition of symmetry .
everybody likes the aquatic theory .
there &apos;s an experiment i think daniel pink refers to where you put two dogs in a box and the box has an electric floor .
but why is it so low ?
man &apos;s best friend in the fight against malaria .
since the dawn of human history , we &apos;ve tried to rectify this imbalance by making art , writing poems , singing songs , scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper , gossiping with friends . this is nothing new .
and she was like , &quot; &quot; oh , that &apos;s interesting . &quot; &quot; the guy across the street , he was a black guy .

we don &apos;t live beneath the sky . we live within it .
so the procession is moving at a stately pace down my street , and as it approaches my house , i start to wave my flag vigorously , and there is the queen mother .
and it &apos;s easy for me as well to train someone who has already passed through the experience of disability .
how do we tap into this ?
so everybody here has a lot of experience with chairs and apples and dogs , and based on this , you could see unfamiliar examples and you could guess , you could sit on the chair , you could eat the apple , the dog will bark .
it just so happens that stewart &apos;s brand of funny doesn &apos;t work unless the facts are true .
( applause )
js : again .
and you hear a rustle in the grass .
otherwise , we &apos;re going to keep pouring oil all over our mental engines and suffering the consequences .
you can feel the dynamism of this living , breathing community .
you know , a lot of medicine is very high risk .
furthermore , if we &apos;re going to really take seriously the need to ensure people share in the economic benefits , our businesses and corporations need a model of globalization that recognizes that they , too , have to take people with them .
and i wanted to let you know , a lot of the things you &apos;ve heard about australians are true .
now , to close the gap , germany has to significantly increase migration , get many more women in the workforce , increase retirement age — by the way , we just lowered it this year — and all these measures at once .
and we put them into one of these experiments , as you &apos;ve seen earlier , and then we watch lively movement that comes out .
let &apos;s have a look at this nice code that is coming from a renaissance book .
( video ) &#91; in spanish &#93; loudspeaker : what kind of city do you want ?
and so through this piano keyboard , we have the means to take a musical process and study it .
if you want to put a colored disk , well all these seven colors coalesce .
and i &apos;d like to take you there , to that morning , for just a quick video .
let me show it to you .
well , obviously not . it would be absurd if we were to engage again in the kind of operations we were engaged in , in iraq and afghanistan if we were to suddenly find ourselves in a situation in which we were imposing anything other than a democratic system .
i &apos;m going to ask that we play it at the speed i read it .
and here you see a brain scan of two children — one who had adequate nutrition , another , neglected and who was deeply malnourished .
the soil is very soft — so soft , that roots can penetrate into it easily , rapidly .
ka : i just want to thank you on behalf of new yorkers for making this happen and getting this done .
and for this one , i want to tell you a quick story .
but in fact he was the person who was most susceptible to the oxygen .
♫ marries me ♫ ♫ well , if no one marries me ♫ ♫ marries me ♫ ♫ well , if no one marries me ♫ thank you .
well , not the one we tagged !
so when wren was on the way , i realized i needed to find a space of my own .
and in that space station we have the genetic material , the chromosomes , within a nucleus .
and i didn &apos;t look like a soldier , that &apos;s for sure .
so , the new festival , it asks the audience to play an essential role in shaping the performance .
we have cells there , typically from the patient .
they &apos;re similar to things that i &apos;ve seen on volcanoes all over the world and even super-volcanoes like yellowstone .
you probably think that the force that i led was all steely-eyed commandos with big knuckle fists carrying exotic weapons .
so don &apos;t fear , this is not going to be a cooking demonstration .
so maybe , you know , there &apos;s no such thing as crazy , and being diagnosed with a mental illness doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re crazy .
we drank a lot of rice wine . we were both so drunk , i couldn &apos;t believe it .
just like a human standing upright without falling over , here we see entropica automatically balancing a pole using a cart .
should you eat organic meats or should you be eating tofu ?
ok . i think if somebody really was drowning , she &apos;d save them .
i thought in getting up to my ted wish i would try to begin by putting in perspective what i try to do and how it fits with what they try to do .
but — and this , of course , is where it becomes complicated — the facts were true , hurrah for archeology , but the interpretation was rather more complicated .
it &apos;s a complicated project .
bp : i was born old .
the key is that civil gps signals are completely open .
it makes no sense for you to fear what is outside of those covers , whether before your birth or after your death .
thank you .
they carried bayonets on their rifles .
( laughter ) and one of the thoughts that i had dealing with these two separate emergences of a book and a baby , and having this event happen so close — that my first thought , when i was still kind of in the apartment looking out at it all or walking out on the street and looking out on it just in front of our building , was that i &apos;d made a terrible miscalculation in the book that i &apos;d just written .
tourism in bilbao increased 2,500 percent after this building was completed .
we are effectively grading someone &apos;s worth to our community .
the most popular news sites don &apos;t do much better .
you &apos;re looking for something that comes and hits you .
campthree is at the base of lhotse , which is the fourth highest mountain in the world , but it &apos;s dwarfed by everest .
in the extreme ice survey , we &apos;re dedicated to bringing those two parts of human understanding together , to merging the art and science to the end of helping us understand nature and humanity &apos;s relationship with nature better .
and it &apos;s kind of the zeitgeist view at this level of the world &apos;s current mythology over the last couple of months .
he said , &quot; &quot; he was not a very careful person as a mathematician .
alice walker has said , &quot; &quot; look closely at the present you are constructing .
my wife and i adore our children .
i &apos;m saying , just do an inventory , expand your social and professional circles .
and have done experiments with about 50,000 students thus far — built , i &apos;d say , about a half dozen schools , my readers , at this point .
... i &apos;ve just ...
( laughter ) thank you .
as you see , everything starts to fade to black , and you see people going to sleep .
be a part of something .
and it felt like technology should enable magic , not kill it .
let &apos;s do something really simple .
but before i do that , let me tell you a couple of things that made this possible .
i discovered that , if i worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials , my hand really wouldn &apos;t hurt , and after having gone from a single approach to art , i ended up having an approach to creativity that completely changed my artistic horizons .
but basically , we have programs now from preschool right through university , with more and more adults starting their own roots and shoots groups .
in kenya , in august , i went to visit one of the v-day safe houses for girls , a house we opened seven years ago with an amazing woman named agnes pareyio .
in this kind of reactor , you can &apos;t do that .
you move on .
our access to digital money and our ability to freely transact is being held captive by these gatekeepers .
but the story is not about these chapters .
i mean , after all , we &apos;re not trees , and most of us are not lobsters .
and i wanted to let my imagination run wild .
what about africa &apos;s capacity to do something about these problems ?
they absolutely encouraged me to take risks , to go , to try , to try . i had an opportunity , an access to a local dance studio , and i had an enlightened teacher who allowed me to make up my own and invent my own dances , so what she did was let me make up my own ballroom and latin american dances to teach to my peers .
i &apos;m not asking people to share nicely in the sandpit .
well , that &apos;s a whole other lecture .
so , i want to see how these things have moved .
and if your employees can &apos;t tell them apart , neither can your consumers . &quot; &quot; now before we started our session this afternoon , i had a chat with gary .
( laughter ) to reiterate the point , let &apos;s go closer into iluvatar .
a foxo is a protein that we found in these little , round worms to affect lifespan , and here it affects lifespan in people .
but i &apos;m actually not here to talk about fiction .
dr : well , it &apos;s a funny thing .
i said , &quot; &quot; excuse me , if i can &apos;t do the stunts , neither can the character . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) ( applause ) this was a part that i was literally born to play they gave it to a non-palsy actress .
either it doesn &apos;t exist at all , or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or some damn fool thing , but in any case it &apos;s not part of science .
and we even went as far as asking ex-commanders of the guerrilla to fly on helicopters with microphones telling the people that used to fight with them , &quot; there is a better life out there , &quot; &quot; &quot; i &apos;m doing good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not worth it , &quot; &quot; etc .
i wanted a better education .
i &apos;ve never seen a representation of a kind of radio interference patterns , which are so ubiquitous and such an important part of our lives .
and this is the only bicyclist that i met in pasadena , so ...
i had no idea how it was possible .
my mom applied for refugee status .
these organisms , how are they insulating against their own electric charge ?
they become rarer because we fish them .
so we have an opportunity to really open up education .
cheryl was the nutrition director at high school in the community in connecticut .
what defines a story are changes , significant moments and endings .
( laughter ) is this how stupid people die ?
and over the course of the next half-year , he slowly learned to approximate the proper adult form , &quot; &quot; water . &quot; &quot; so we &apos;re going to cruise through half a year in about 40 seconds .
though it &apos;s actually true , you know , the reason i &apos;m talking to you right now is because i was born in brazil .
there &apos;s also a mission proposed for space , which hopefully will launch in the next ten years , called lisa .
what have i lost in the last decades ?
we came from two different worlds .
so we &apos;re going to have to go all-out thermonuclear response , stimulate the total cytokine cascade .
but we had to make it fairly robust , much more robust than the robots we build in our labs .
well , what then happened over the last 50 or 60 years , is that goods have become commoditized .
bia started a campaign , and we even watched her school 24 / 7 through webcam monitoring , and many months afterwards , the government changed their minds .
but the day after the apology , what happened ?
and medication didn &apos;t help him anymore .
thank you .
that was a real experience for one of my patients , and when he created his mask , he was able to let go of that haunting image .
don &apos;t put it all in the brain , but put some of the control in tuned feet , legs and even body .
shouldn &apos;t the reputation that he &apos;s personally invested on building on airbnb mean that it should travel with him from one community to another ?
by the time he was 20 , he was an options trader .
i had a sick body ; that was all .
he would know where things would fit in the sky .
that is the notion of investment .
at that time , i noticed that corruption , that grand corruption , that systematic corruption , was undermining everything we were trying to do .
a conductive pen from the lewis lab at uiuc .
you can see this work . it &apos;s on the mouth of the mersey , just outside liverpool .
we &apos;ve allowed judaism to be claimed by violently messianic west bank settlers , christianity by homophobic hypocrites and misogynistic bigots , islam by suicide bombers .
they are culturally invisible . we do not make movies about these .
so , where do we look for inspiration ? we &apos;ve still got bill clinton .
other people are going to say , &quot; &quot; this is great .
we need to get the math ; we need to get the statistics out to the american people .
my seeing her , it wasn &apos;t her , at the mailbox .
you know the words i mean ?
so , it should have happened about 480,000 years ago .
thank you very much .
and gratefully , it didn &apos;t .
and we &apos;re going to look at their saving behavior .
after i came back home , i was wandering through the grocery store , and i froze in the produce department .
ok , now let &apos;s look at these three portraits .
i might , after all , know that she wasn &apos;t a good driver .
and in some ways we had hooked ourselves back onto this idea : cells , organisms , environments , because we were now thinking about bone stem cells , we were thinking about arthritis in terms of a cellular disease .
from alternatives to battle disease so we don &apos;t need antibiotics and chemicals anymore , to automated feeders that feel when the fish are hungry , so we can save on feed and create less pollution .
that day i ended up spending nearly 60 .
he was building a machine to do mathematics , and lovelace said , &quot; &quot; you could do more than mathematics on this machine . &quot; &quot; and just as you do , everyone in this room already &apos;s got a computer on them right now , because they &apos;ve got a phone .
when we produce materials , we need to extract them from the environment , and we need a whole bunch of environmental impacts .
if i &apos;m the worst person in the world , you can hate me and move on .
first night in the nursing home unit where she had been in the same assisted living facility , moved her from one bed to another , kind of threw her , rebroke her pelvis , sent her back to the hospital that she had just come from , no one read the chart , put her on tylenol , which she is allergic to , broke out , got bedsores , basically , had heart problems , and died from the fall and the complications and the errors that were there .
that &apos;s because of the language of guns .
is matter evolvable ?
i go down into the subway — i take the subway a lot — and this piece of paper is taped to a girder .
( music ) ( video ) ( children &apos;s voices ) child &apos;s voice : there are more kids in zaatari than adults right now .
of course they must be more energy-efficient .
but the key one really is the encoder alone , because we can team up the encoder with the different transducer .
so they go down one side of the mountain , they go down another .
she took my clothes off , and then she pinned me down on the floor .
everybody says that .
a great deal of them .
the idea there behind these two pictures is that the chinese government can act above rule of law .
and perhaps more interesting , and more importantly , the question is , can you apply this model more globally outside medicine ?
because our home is the universe , and we are the universe , essentially .
if you look at the statistics , the odds are not very favorable to us .
how much worse is b than a ?
she listens , because that &apos;s what people who tell stories do first .
we could look across time at the same people — people , for example , who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia — and ask what the contribution of mothering , of genetics are , and we could isolate third variables by doing experiments on the mental illnesses .
he studied law and philosophy with guidance from mentors , but he also realized that being a lawyer involved persuading other people , so he also studied great speeches and acting .
but anyway , take a look at its pollen .
it &apos;s a plot of intensity of light over time .
ca : and that &apos;s the same with universal flu vaccine , the same kind of thing ?
and they will start to use as much as the old west are doing already .
and with that shift in thinking , we can now start to imagine new questions , new possibilities for robots that we might not have thought about otherwise .
you could apply that to the human brain in explaining some of the behaviors and the functions of the human brain as emergent phenomena : how we walk , how we talk , how we play chess , all these questions about behavior .
doctor healy then subsequently became the first female director of our national institutes of health .
thank you very much .
she &apos;s the one he &apos;s looking at , and &#91; she &apos;s &#93; the one he &apos;s coming for . can you see that ?
man 8 : okay , a12 , right there !
and so i consider myself one of these people , along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists , who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas .
and finally , we &apos;re going to put the marriott hotel and the portola plaza on the top .
what about what we want ?
and i said , &quot; &quot; you know , this is a little deep .
double click on an icon , that &apos;s a cause .
so i &apos;d help her up and take both her hands and help her walk to the kitchen .
and there are people who think that the existence of my family somehow undermines or weakens or damages their family .
famine mostly is a rural event now .
if i do it kind of right , it might move kind of like the real thing .
the scientists must insure that the ice is not contaminated .
it doesn &apos;t recognize an ironic smile , or a happy smile , or a frustrated smile .
if you see the red line , you are seeing the trail of the pigeon ; if you don &apos;t see the red line , you are the pigeon .
so whenever they &apos;d launch a big ship , they would invite some dignitary up from london on the train to make a speech , break a bottle of champagne over the bows , launch it down the slipway into the river and out to sea .
and they see what &apos;s going on .
don &apos;t medicate kids for attention deficit disorder unless it is really , really freaking bad .
but i decided no , it &apos;s a power to prevent , because that &apos;s what i learned when i was growing up .
when you take a picture with your smartphone or digital camera , there &apos;s a lot of additional information saved along in that image .
is change possible in our emotions , in our traits , in our moods ?
it &apos;s trying to get a grasp on you , on the firmware inside the human skull , so that it can recommend what movie you might want to watch next — which is a very , very difficult problem .
so it &apos;s a selfless act intended to benefit only the other .
the lancet , one of the two greatest medical journals in the world , last summer labeled this a medical emergency now .
reviews , ratings , checkmarks : these are the attestations about our identities that we cobble together today and use to lower uncertainty about who we &apos;re dealing with .
so , von neumann was already off in a theoretical cloud , doing abstract sorts of studies of how you could build reliable machines out of unreliable components .
the computer in your cellphone today is a million times cheaper , a million times smaller , a thousand times more powerful .
and now , under the spell of a technological illusion , we could ignore our fears and truly interact .
in my tradition , there is a gift that we have made to other traditions — to everybody around the world who knows the story of the &quot; &quot; good samaritan . &quot; &quot; many people think of it primarily in terms of charity , random acts of kindness .
i &apos;ve described to you the opposite of a success story .
well , what i can do now with my colleagues in computer science is we can create computer algorithms that can analyze the linguistic traces of deception .
and hofstadter wrote a book called &quot; &quot; i am a strange loop . &quot; &quot; in the course of that book , he describes a moment — just months after carol has died — he comes across her picture on the mantel , or on a bureau in his bedroom .
in these rooms , the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well , and when charlie saw this , he got really excited .
so my dream is something like this .
the dog doesn &apos;t speak english , or american , or spanish , or french .
it was essentially india being itself .
and in a place like kruger , the soaring elephant densities are a real problem .
my point is that you don &apos;t have to be neutral to talk .
and i still kept — so , in the last year i &apos;ve been spending time with heads of state and generals and tribal chiefs who all want this , and i keep saying , but this isn &apos;t the real thing .
there are applications you can get on smartphones for just a few dollars that do the same thing .
( applause ) ted is all about patterns in the clouds .
every single time , he &apos;s going to take one of these away and give the monkeys just two .
so just like personalized medicine , while you might imagine wanting to treat every patient individually , what we &apos;d like to do is build models of individual plants and then tell the farmer what kind of inputs every plant needs — the inputs in this case being water , fertilizer and pesticide .
that &apos;s one of the reasons so much of what we &apos;ve come to think of as western science and mathematics and engineering was really worked out in the first few centuries of the common era by the persians and the arabs and the turks .
oftentimes , we think that we have to relate new knowledge to prior knowledge .
no , the boy said to me — the boy said to me , &quot; it would destroy me . &quot;
if you agree with the factual analysis , but you don &apos;t feel the sense of urgency , where does that leave you ?
i don &apos;t want the poetry of the calligraphy to be broken , as it &apos;s art and you can appreciate it without knowing the meaning , as you can enjoy any music from other countries .
so how could the secret of everlasting youth actually lie within the bat genome ? does anybody want to hazard a guess over how long this bat could live for ?
that &apos;s a boeing 707 .
otherwise , go bother somebody else today .
now let me tell you , if you want to experience the visceral feeling of trusting strangers — ( laughter ) i recommend this , especially if those strangers are drunk german people . ( laughter )
they left my chest open for two weeks .
and the second is that it could be responsible for the problem of the cold chain that i &apos;ll tell you about as well .
it shows without ambiguity that there is structural change and functional change in the brain when you train the altruistic love .
so it was pretty interesting stuff .
then they had strangers , many strangers , judge the person &apos;s personality just from facebook , and what they found was those judgments of the personality were pretty much identical , highly correlated , meaning that facebook profiles really do reflect our actual personality .
these robots we &apos;re shipping every day .
and i throw this slide in — this is me , actually , two months ago — and i throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal , chambered nautilus .
they said , we &apos;ve been looking at the oceans for a long time now , and we want to tell you they &apos;re not in trouble , they &apos;re near collapse .
and the results of that are kids getting sick .
i mean , that would be a bit like asking chris columbus in 1491 , &quot; &quot; hey chris , you know , what happens if it turns out that there &apos;s a continent between here and japan , where you &apos;re sailing to , what will be the consequences for humanity if that turns out to be the case ? &quot; &quot; and i think chris would probably offer you some answer that you might not have understood , but it probably wouldn &apos;t have been right , and i think that to predict what finding e.t. &apos; s going to mean , we can &apos;t predict that either .
and after he would leave , women and girls would stay behind .
well , because we can &apos;t transport books across borders , there had to be separate versions read in all the different english-speaking countries : britain , united states , canada , australia , and new zealand all had to have separate readings of harry potter .
so what i &apos;m asking today , the question i want to explore with you today is , what kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality ?
and the pain is not the problem : it ’ s the symptom .
in between , we want to talk to people about it .
and when the book came out , i was heralded as africa &apos;s answer to frederick forsyth , which is a dubious honor at best .
why can &apos;t we wait for them to die ?
so i want to leave that as a thought with you .
i wondered how we might interface with these animals .
i know it &apos;s not an easy thing , so i admire that you can do this .
thank you .
in the second world war , too , the existence of solar radiation was demonstrated by studies of interference that was detected by the radar stations of great britain .
now if you think about it , in the age before gps and radar , that was obviously a really difficult problem .
( laughter ) and in those days , i developed an ear to identify birds just by the sound of the bangs they made against the glass .
maybe we can collect some good password data and actually advance the state of the art here .
he can &apos;t focus , but he loves walking around and getting people energized . &quot; &quot; no one said , &quot; &quot; get him a coach in speaking . &quot; &quot; they said , get me a tutor in what i suck at .
for about the five years after graduating from an upstanding liberal arts university , this was my day job .
that makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research .
by doing that , we &apos;ve been able to make a superfiber which is about 380 percent tougher , and 300 percent more elastic .
ab : no , we need to be polite about differences .
one trend that we notice in all those things is that the amount of energy per gram per second that flows through this , is actually increasing .
anybody who sees this project plan needs to immediately say , &quot; i want to do this — and there &apos;s my spot ! &quot;
and off we go .
most of them are pretty basic .
as i moved through , i achieved a very reasonable facsimile of the maltese falcon .
and this is one of the ways you can study play — is to get a 256-lead electroencephalogram .
remember , our evolutionary-conserved sequences we &apos;re using on this array allow us to detect even novel or uncharacterized viruses , because we pick what is conserved throughout evolution .
years go by , of course , and the writing , it doesn &apos;t happen instantly , as i &apos;m trying to convey it to you here at ted .
nobel prize nominee hernando de soto recognized that the key to economic liftoff for most developing countries is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land .
i &apos;m trying to say we have to combine all the systems , and with one condition : never — if you have a subway , if you have surface systems , if you have any kind of system — never compete in the same space .
recently , i flew over a crowd of thousands of people in brazil playing music by george frideric handel .
every time i sort of pushed one down , another one would pop back up again .
and then you see a date .
the sciences , to me , are manifestations of our attempt to express or share our understanding , our experience , to influence the universe external to ourselves .
so there &apos;s a certain performance level that the computer would need to get to .
they are bird-blending machines .
( applause )
gloria stuart : that was the last time titanic ever saw daylight .
but chances are the postcard image you have in your brain is one of these , the dromedary , quintessential desert creature — hangs out in sandy , hot places like the middle east and the sahara , has a big old hump on its back for storing water for those long desert treks , has big , broad feet to help it tromp over sand dunes .
we &apos;ll look at ocean warming .
now this is what you do , is you bend both these legs into a triangle , and you just wrap some tape around .
but why ?
but how would that machine then interact with reality ?
i was doing a pathetically slow speed of about 1.3 knots , and they were doing only marginally less pathetic speed of about 1.4 : it was like two snails in a mating dance .
so , let me show them to you . that &apos;s one , two three , four , five .
yeah .
it &apos;s brilliant , right ?
my solution : forget micro-entrepreneurs .
i actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier for creative experimentation , if you will , that we &apos;ve explored and begun to settle this wild land of the internet and are now just getting ready to start to build structures on it , and those structures are the new formats of storytelling that the internet will allow us to create .
bats are also threatened in the u.s.
by which this might happen .
there are other parasites that do this — which render the host sterile .
that &apos;s the smashing part of the heel on both these images , and it gets worn away . in fact , i &apos;ve seen them wear away their heel all the way to the flesh .
but at the same time , you see this video coming up here .
global citizens , innovators , business leaders , individuals , we need you .
and i held out my hand , reaching for something to believe in .
i think i was afraid that we would become inadvertent icons for the process of falling in love , a position i did not at all feel qualified for .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re changing the perception of insects .
it &apos;s a place where people have the longest disability-free life expectancy in the world .
wk : yeah . the windmill .
( applause ) number four : giant solar flares .
it &apos;s the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all .
and here &apos;s one example that &apos;s really exciting .
but i managed to do it .
well , it &apos;s not so surprising that they &apos;ve gone extinct . ( laughter ) but in fact that &apos;s not why they went extinct .
but grind it , roast it , package it , put it on a grocery store shelf , and now it &apos;ll cost five , 10 , 15 cents , when you treat it as a good .
anna deavere smith famously said that there &apos;s a literature inside of each of us , and three generations later , i was part of a project called storycorps , which set out to capture the stories of ordinary americans by setting up a soundproof booth in public spaces .
something between 20 and 25 percent of all life forms on the planet , including plants , are beetles .
why is this ? i used medical college girls .
metallic objects — albeit very small ones , a few tons at most — escaped into orbit around the earth .
( music ) in the year of my birth the nintendo entertainment system also went into development .
but i have now a message to the ladies .
here , all this food comes off this farm , and at the end of the season there is actually more soil , more fertility and more biodiversity .
but torvalds said , &quot; &quot; no , i &apos;m not going to do that . &quot; &quot; his point of view on this was very clear .
and basically , we started this because we were tired of complaining about our politicians .
as you can see , sometimes a subspecies branches off .
the same countries , the same measure of inequality , one problem after another .
one two years earlier had killed more than a million people .
an anti-sandinista guerrilla was mortally wounded as commander zero attacked a town in southern nicaragua .
so i &apos;m going to talk a little about each of them .
visitors are transient . we want people who live here , people who have ownership . &quot; &quot; and so what we &apos;re doing is making a broad array of different ways for people to actually engage with the material inside of these galleries , so you can still have a traditional gallery experience , but if you &apos;re interested , you can actually engage with any individual artwork and see the original context from where it &apos;s from , or manipulate the work itself .
they &apos;re going to work on the genomes of the passenger pigeon and the band-tailed pigeon .
i did comic book arbitrage .
and that source is design for generosity .
or is this just right for this place ?
see , some have decided a priori what kinds of changes they want to see , and only such changes can be called political reform .
einstein said this : &quot; &quot; if you can &apos;t write about a subject , in a simple way , it &apos;s because , in fact , you don &apos;t understand it . &quot; &quot; so , if you ... ( applause ) to einstein ... ( applause ) to einstein ... ( applause ) so — ah , ah , i don &apos;t have time ! — so , if you do know what you want to say — don &apos;t you ? — you are aware of what you want to say , you just have to do one thing : believe that it is possible to write in a simple way .
we know from ice core research that the transition from these cold conditions to warm conditions wasn &apos;t smooth , as you might predict from the slow increase in solar radiation .
so i think women in our society are becoming leaders , because they realize that for their future generations , it &apos;s very important to maintain our cultural identities .
and there &apos;s two things i do : when i go into a gallery , first of all , i go quite fast , and i look at everything , and i pinpoint the ones that make me slow down for some reason or other .
it &apos;s just love .
( applause ) thank you .
and i think these words really nail it : &quot; &quot; it means a society based upon the opinion of civilians .
the green ocean has the same clean air , but forms a lot of rain .
but in fact , what we &apos;ve seen is none of those were true .
( laughter ) and then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these — look like jellyfish legs , also polyurethane .
it &apos;s the number one killer of women in the united states today .
a year ago in kenya we had post-election violence .
but this phenomenal project &apos;s been happening .
thank you .
and what that means is , you are going to walk around with your own personal genome on a smart card . it will be here .
so when google was about to introduce gmail and youtube , they knew that their data storage system wasn &apos;t adequate .
and that &apos;s it , so you can just control it , wherever you want , and it &apos;s just hours of fun . and these are no longer in production , so you have real collector &apos;s items .
the age of the ocean , the tectonic plates , gives rise to a totally new phenomenon that we have heard about in this conference .
meetup is the platform , but the value here is in social infrastructure .
one is tempted to say that today &apos;s pantheon is the internet , but i actually think that &apos;s quite wrong , or at least it &apos;s only part of the story .
so , steven spielberg , eat your heart out .
so when people have started to speculate about what might have been wrong with goliath , they &apos;ve said , &quot; &quot; wait a minute , he looks and sounds an awful lot like someone who has acromegaly . &quot; &quot; and that would also explain so much of what was strange about his behavior that day .
i think it &apos;s important to promote in a more positive way on how we see ourselves .
because we need an international legal framework for robotic weapons .
design is not just for designers anymore . it &apos;s a process . it &apos;s not style .
and by sharing resources , we were able to dig deep — much deeper and longer than most media organizations allow these days , because of financial concerns .
it was developed within a two-year period and used on actual exploratory projects .
from the ease with which you swept away obstacles that no one knew could even be budged .
and i want to mention that these seals were used for stamping clay tags that were attached to bundles of goods , so it &apos;s quite likely that these tags , at least some of them , contain names of merchants .
so , natural selection will favor organisms that are more likely to cause damage .
it became the winning architecture to generate exciting new results in object recognition .
plugged me into the wires , put me to sleep , gave me the muscle relaxant .
so , by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history , selam unites us all and gives us a unique account on what makes us human .
among them there was my right-hand man , najmuddin .
the main unit will then go inside the brain .
there are four things that are critical to stopping ebola .
over the next two decades , we &apos;ll see the demand for energy rise by 40 percent , and the growth in the economy and in the population is putting increasing pressure on our land , on our water and on our forests .
and then he happened to stumble across a post about taskrabbit .
i won &apos;t go into the details of why we think the universe is like this , but it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know .
and you &apos;re not going to get comfortable before you get uncomfortable .
and you can have a hundred million of these homes , and it &apos;s great because they suck carbon .
give it a try .
we need a beautiful diversity of flowers that blooms over the entire growing season , from spring to fall .
we , all of us , are what happens when a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium evolves for so long that it begins to ask where it came from .
is it ?
so whenever you talk about africa , you have to put up this picture of the world from space , and people go , &quot; &quot; look , it &apos;s the dark continent . &quot; &quot; actually , it isn &apos;t .
they &apos;re more likely to feel intrigued when they encounter something that contradicts their expectations .
she said , &quot; &quot; who is this charles bonnet ? &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; did he have them himself ? &quot; &quot; and she said , &quot; &quot; tell all the nurses that i have charles bonnet syndrome . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) &quot; i &apos;m not crazy . i &apos;m not demented . i have charles bonnet syndrome . &quot;
it &apos;s crazy .
by last count , there were 48 different online markets that i know of .
i started thinking about this and the caviar vending machine and the art-o-mat all together , and some reason , i was one night drawing a vending machine , thinking about doing paintings of a vending machine , and the little vial of my dna was sitting there , and i saw this kind of beautiful collaboration between the strands of dna and the coils of a vending machine .
i mean , they complain about it all the time .
this is kareem &apos;s dark eyes and that &apos;s the white background that you see here .
and maybe these healing zones can sprinkle a map , little dots on a map .
in fact , this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important that i began to think about what happens with old technology .
the idea was to have — the same principal , a divided country — take cartoonists from all sides and let them do something together .
but before i go too much further into that , let me tell you a little bit about how we got started with this idea .
the waste water that leaks out is water that already now goes into that coastal environment , and the algae that leak out are biodegradable , and because they &apos;re living in waste water , they &apos;re fresh water algae , which means they can &apos;t live in salt water , so they die .
and there , in the town , he &apos;s approached by a dog who comes like this — one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries , even in america , i think , in some areas — and he &apos;s looking just terrible .
more specifically , i want you to feel like you &apos;re capable of becoming an excellent long-distance swimmer , a world-class language learner , and a tango champion .
there is a glut of film , the quality has to be raised , they need to go to the next level , but i ’ m optimistic .
people are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy .
and of course , the third motivator , one near and dear to my heart as an entrepreneur , is wealth .
( laughter ) in any case , i didn &apos;t readily claim the feminist label , even though it was all around me , because i associated it with my mom &apos;s women &apos;s groups , her swishy skirts and her shoulder pads — none of which had much cachet in the hallways of palmer high school where i was trying to be cool at the time .
don &apos;t we deserve to be saved ? don &apos;t i ?
i stopped doing surgery about six years ago and became a full-time writer , as many people know .
but it &apos;s the rideshare board , and it &apos;s basically the same thing .
and my position is that men need the very things that women have identified that they need to live the lives they say they want to live in order to live the lives that we say we want to live .
and here &apos;s another image of diarrhea .
one of my colleagues in bulgaria , nevena markova , spent about 20 years studying these profiles .
and it really is reconstructing , quite accurately , teleconferencing .
right there !
what do you have to get in order to be happy ?
in doing this , what we &apos;ve discovered is that humans are literal canaries in social exchanges .
i want you to know that there are farms out there — like bill keener in sequatchie cove farm in tennessee — whose cows do eat grass and whose pigs do roll in the mud , just like i thought .
we now know that there are many planets at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars .
in fact there is little evidence that there is any cognitive ability in a very young infant .
through haiti rewired , through build change , architecture for humanity , aidg , there is the possibility to reach out to 30,000 — 40,000 masons across the country and create a movement of proper building .
this is one of the reasons why mohammed doesn &apos;t really regret dropping out of school right after his injury .
research by catalyst and others has shown conclusively that the more gender-equal companies are , the better it is for workers , the happier their labor force is .
i just want you to name the color of the object .
they want to go in and out of all the places they are because the thing that matters most to them is control over where they put their attention .
it &apos;s the application of massive-scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture .
we will soon be using grid computing to do pretty much everything , like adjust the data and everything that goes with the data .
it &apos;s a little hard to understand that , because you can go to a costco in the united states and buy cheap fish .
so it &apos;s a really nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues , where we &apos;re asking people to make a sacrifice and they themselves don &apos;t really benefit from their own sacrifice .
we &apos;ve all trained ourselves to perform these utterly miraculous feats of memory using a set of ancient techniques , techniques invented 2,500 years ago in greece , the same techniques that cicero had used to memorize his speeches , that medieval scholars had used to memorize entire books . &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; whoa . how come i never heard of this before ? &quot; &quot; and we were standing outside the competition hall , and ed , who is a wonderful , brilliant , but somewhat eccentric english guy , says to me , &quot; &quot; josh , you &apos;re an american journalist .
21 : 00 hours , and it &apos;s just our squad going through today &apos;s events in our heads , whether we want to or not .
that &apos;s the natural cadence of a trip .
a bigger one for you to look at .
so in the last 10 years and the hope for the future , we &apos;ve seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology , a science of what makes life worth living .
if you &apos;ve had any design courses , they would teach you you can &apos;t read this .
once he stepped onto the floor and out of the bed , the pressure sensor would detect an increase in pressure caused by body weight and then wirelessly send an audible alert to the caregiver &apos;s smartphone .
on that view , consciousness doesn &apos;t dangle outside the physical world as some kind of extra .
but the good news is that we don &apos;t have to figure it out as we go along ; we have models , we have examples , like benki and sanghamitra and jianchuan .
you &apos;ve got a coil .
conscious but dazed by the blasts , you lay on your side and attempt to process what has just happened .
i totally want to go to that wedding .
it did not correlate with the poverty levels . it did not correlate .
and they are what give the word &quot; &quot; moonshot &quot; &quot; its meaning .
this idea of fireflies in a jar , for some reason , was always really exciting to me .
if i made the leap into these new technologies , then how did we — what happened before that ?
and an inorganic material would normally be really brittle , and you wouldn &apos;t be able to have that sort of strength and toughness in it .
ss : ok , ok , ok , two things .
no powerpoint is used in two days .
he didn &apos;t recommend me , by the way .
how about the people who can &apos;t do that because they have no access — the people in the midwest for example ?
and here is what we wanted to do : we wanted to make it so that sound from the world gets converted in some way so that a deaf person can understand what is being said .
in mll , it &apos;s the middle set of genes , and in aml , it &apos;s the bottom set of genes .
we just — we go like that , and we imagine that that &apos;s what deafness is about .
this is happening by itself .
( applause )
three of the original eight entities were suing each other .
and here are the results of this wonderful project that is the system in venezuela .
today , i &apos;m here to share the experience of what it &apos;s like to be the mother of someone who kills and hurts .
we consider first that life has a body .
we obtained an influenza vaccine , we applied it to our nanopatches and we applied the nanopatches to the skin , and we waited — and this is in the live animal .
but she does remember one moment .
we forgot about the entire chain around us .
people were generally aware of this , but most of them felt powerless to do anything about it — until one group of citizens , just 12 regular people , put out a call on facebook to their friends to meet in the central plaza , holding signs with a message : &quot; &quot; renuncia ya &quot; &quot; — resign already .
it &apos;s current pleasure in exchange for future pain .
and he &apos;d tell me how he &apos;s leaving his wife , and i believed him , until i got pregnant .
so i think reason is not just some neutral tool to help you get whatever you want .
now , when you &apos;re faced with a problem , you fall back on what you know , and all we really knew was design .
and so if you &apos;re looking for growth industries to get into , that &apos;s not a good one — protecting natural creatures . human population is going up ; it &apos;s going to continue for quite a while .
these are actually cells that we obtained .
we &apos;re adding life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
and then i started rubbing , very very gently , till some of the edges were quite square . and then i constructed it .
how can we know what &apos;s causing the observed warming ?
a race of advanced extraterrestrials watching our solar system from afar could confidently predict earth &apos;s final doom in another six billion years .
it &apos;s too slow .
and i succeeded .
many of them are too young to run for president , but by putting the issues out there , they are influencing the presidential race .
now , we can speculate and philosophize this , but we don &apos;t actually have to for the next hundred years .
ha : yes , i was working in a tough situation , very dangerous .
we flew into a town that had a static , outdated website and a frenetic facebook feed , trying to structure the response , and we launched our platform .
that would be very sad .
( laughter ) so you can &apos;t actually see them , but it was breathtaking , believe me . ( laughter )
we mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy .
so in my opinion , the research evidence is compelling and the logic of this is compelling .
so , all in all , in an age when the visual image of any kind was rare , tapestries were an incredibly potent form of propaganda .
sadly , it &apos;s come true . malaria , as we all know , kills approximately one million people a year .
there are 168 hours in a week .
and the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty .
this image is totally incorrect , totally incorrect .
i did that . me !
that &apos;s where all these problems come from .
everyone wants an aims center in their country .
i said , &quot; &quot; probation ? i &apos;m already on probation , that don &apos;t matter ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) it was academic probation , not criminal probation .
children dress with very colorful , colorful clothes , and it is incredible to see the power that this has in the hands of kids , in a computer . and i have to tell you that it &apos;s so easy to appreciate the impact that access to technology and connectivity can have in the lives and education of these kids .
more participation , more peer coordination , sometimes distorts outcomes and there are some things , like things , for example , in the medical profession that we want new power to get nowhere near .
we just need a time machine .
the harvard men never ask that question .
she thought my side beat up on her side way more often , that we called them brainless , gun-toting racists , and we both marveled at the labels that fit none of the people we actually know .
and i got really good at predicting how many body bags you would need for the people who were going to die in these camps .
it &apos;s a feature .
they have to try and attract pollinators to do their bidding .
it &apos;s happening .
and the reason is simple : because wind builds up the sand , gravity makes it fall .
and so it was then that i realized there was an opportunity for me to collaborate with these scientists , and so i jumped at that opportunity .
people seem to do a limited amount of strategic thinking using theory of mind .
and we &apos;ve got , as is the case around the world , about 95 percent of all loans returned .
if we ended recruitment fees for migrant workers ?
the girls are brought up to be mothers .
when i was nine years old , my mom asked me what i would want my house to look like , and i drew this fairy mushroom .
and we spent that time designing interactive prototypes for computer software and testing them with little girls .
but i knew that epidemics emerge along the fissures of our society , reflecting not only biology , but more importantly patterns of marginalization , exclusion , discrimination related to race , gender , sexuality , class and more .
in the hospital , they have to speak english .
i remember , for some reason , that they were exactly the same height .
the whole surface of it is covered with 60 million diodes , red , blue , and green , that allow you to have a high-resolution picture , visible in daylight .
the second challenge i have is that i must ask for understanding and even compassion when i talk about my son &apos;s death as a suicide .
now , we were lucky with our hand-cleaning .
like all stories , fears have characters .
through history , people have gone back into their own pasts , sometimes to a precious time in their life , to their childhood , and often , the mind gravitates in the past to a moment of shame , some sin committed , some act of selfishness , an act of omission , of shallowness , the sin of anger , the sin of self-pity , trying to be a people-pleaser , a lack of courage .
this is done entirely using , kind of , the tools that are built into second life , so the innate concept of becoming pregnant and having a baby , of course — second life is , at the platform level , at the level of the company — at linden lab — second life has no game properties to it whatsoever .
what we need to think about perhaps for mission blue is increasing the biologging capacity .
the old-fashioned lightbulbs , the incandescent bulbs — i &apos;m not going to ask for a show of hands of how many of you still have them in your homes , wasting energy every time you switch them on — change them after this — or whether we have them on the stage here at ted or not — but those old incandescent light bulbs really should have been sold as heaters .
that &apos;s what we want to see . that &apos;s why it &apos;s hard .
we can study the way that one person interacts with another person , turn the numbers up , and start to gain new insights into the boundaries of normal cognition , but more importantly , we can put people with classically defined mental illnesses , or brain damage , into these social interactions , and use these as probes of that .
i mean , really , same example : if you don &apos;t like politicians calling each other names , stop clicking on the stories about what one guy in one party called the other guy in the other party .
the next was to add mobility — so , have the screen on a mobile base .
when we think about human capital we think about the things we can measure easily — things like grades , sat &apos;s , degrees , the number of years in schooling .
that if you live in the best climate , in san diego in the united states , or in the shittiest climate , in buffalo , new york , you are going to be just as happy in either place .
and against the odds , we found a match for her , who turned out to be me .
we &apos;re kind of stuck in a loop , perhaps , and this sense of possibility from computing is something i &apos;ve been questioning for the last 10 or so years , and have looked to design , as we understand most things , and to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine .
well , you know , we should expect to see that .
but there was a pretty big problem with this .
i know , i think we should keep them as a surprise .
but what we don &apos;t have is a really good model of human psychology .
people say , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s wrong with having a conversation .
as you might know , proteins are large biological molecules that perform different functions within our body , like catalyzing metabolic reactions or responding to stimuli or replicating dna , but before a protein is expressed or produced , relevant parts of its genetic code present in the dna are copied into the messenger rna , so this messenger rna has instructions on how to build a specific protein , and potentially it can build hundreds of proteins , but the one that tells them when to build them and how many to build are micrornas .
here that same line of text wraps around a fountain in an illustration that can be turned upside down and read both ways .
so finally , i would like to say , so let &apos;s help africa walk upright and forward , then we all can be proud of our future legacy as a species .
then there &apos;s the point of embarkation , that is , the point of transition from ordinary life to being a pilgrim on a quest .
so , when the visitors come , mars walks up to the computer , starts typing &quot; &quot; hello , my name is mars . &quot; &quot; welcome to romela , the robotics mechanisms laboratory at virginia tech .
and we &apos;ve just over the last few years found out that the microbes in different parts of the body are amazingly different from one another .
i have a bunch of other inventions .
but today , the international drug control regime is starting to crumble .
is &quot; &quot; better off &quot; &quot; finding a secure job that you can count on for the rest of your life ?
and there are others who are extremely high .
because that &apos;s when implanted devices inside of people started to have networking capabilities .
you won &apos;t do that by accident ; you will do that because you are guided to do that .
you might recognize him from the previous demos .
we know that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the united states .
and it &apos;s really important you understand that for civilization to make progress , each generation has to do better than the last one .
so instead of starting little websites like the kids in palo alto do , the kids in shenzhen make new cell phones .
leading with beauty means rising above what is merely necessary .
i worked in tourism for one year in mexico , one year in egypt .
what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and creepy — obviously in an effort to drive maintenance engineers crazy , that they would not be able to figure this out quickly .
so you get to experience that in real time , right ?
i found a problem , a specific problem that actually found an error with that .
i swear to god . i mean , when you look at the box , and you sort of see how it works .
and the bubbles keep moving up there , and this is what the world looks like today .
and we have had some significant successes .
think about it : if you were sitting there in 1750 trying to figure out the big changes coming to society in the 19th , the 20th centuries , automated machines , computers , artificial intelligence , a programmable flute entertaining the parisian elite would have been as powerful a clue as anything else at the time .
then you see his left leg .
another is , you can make ngos accountable .
and so the present self can trounce all over its dreams .
if we add water , what will happen is , this swellable material is going to absorb the water , the polymer chains will move apart from each other , and the entire material is going to become bigger .
if you take the camera above , you start thinking about these numbers again .
this gives a tremendous advantage to the attacker , because the defender doesn &apos;t know who to fight back against .
how do you have safer sex , how do you use a condom regularly if there hasn &apos;t been disclosure ?
and software companies make 35 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades .
now , i don &apos;t want to create the misimpression that china &apos;s hunky-dory , on the way to some kind of superpowerdom .
i &apos;m really worried that , especially kids today , they &apos;re not going to be dealing with this down-time , that they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture , and that everything comes to them , and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it .
more than half .
and that , of course , had been a question i wanted to know .
and i know i &apos;ve performed for some of your companies or some of you have seen me elsewhere , but this is honestly one of the best audiences i &apos;ve ever experienced .
we have like 40 kids , ex-child soldiers mixed with anybody that we feel like we want to support .
and so it is not just what &apos;s happening to these people — whether they &apos;re losing weight or gaining weight , or becoming rich or becoming poor , or becoming happy or not becoming happy — that affects us ; it &apos;s also the actual architecture of the ties around us .
so now you have an evolutionary excuse .
she feels different .
india is coming on line .
and i certainly didn &apos;t do myself any favors .
it &apos;s part of our survival package , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s become so important for us , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re always listening at that level .
but also , these cultures , these indigenous cultures , are disappearing much faster than the forests themselves .
so i &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; mr. huf isn &apos;t going to be very happy when i told him his house has gone to another , into the atmosphere somewhere . &quot; &quot; so to cut the story short , i decided that i had to go back and do it .
as a frenchman , i must say that there are a lot of french intellectuals that think happiness is not at all interesting .
i asked people to anonymously share an artful secret they &apos;d never told anyone before .
again , the research shows that we prefer voices which are rich , smooth , warm , like hot chocolate .
that &apos;s what fear and anxiety does ; it causes you to be — what &apos;s called depth-first processing — to focus , not be distracted .
it goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle , then the junior non-manual , going up high to the professional occupations — doctors , lawyers , directors of larger companies .
choose to see through them .
well , that is what the us government has determined that the cost of owning a car is per mile .
but in a way , you know , it &apos;s the same if i look at you and i see a nice bright young lady with a pink top on .
the answer is : long-lived molecules , because if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage , but then the molecule is destroyed — like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis — then the damage is gone , too .
it would be easier for other people to wear the helmet and record their eyes .
and this is von neumann and morgenstern , who wrote the &quot; &quot; theory of games . &quot; &quot; all these forces came together there , in princeton .
and the next steps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years .
something was missing , you know . i mean , these are — it &apos;s kind of weird to think that someone had to do an experiment to show that , but that was what was going on at the time .
there were like 20 people there .
i actually shared that with some legislators here in the u.s.
they engage in mental time travel . they remember what happened yesterday .
so that &apos;s the good news .
please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike , or breath , is being pulled . just experience the whole journey of that sound in the same way that i wished i &apos;d experienced the whole journey of this particular conference , rather than just arriving last night .
well , in the mid- &apos; 70s , there were not great opportunities for a bioengineer like me , especially in italy , and so i decided , with some researchers from the united states and the university of florence , to start probing the murals decorated by vasari on the long walls of the hall of the 500 searching for the lost leonardo .
so if you take a deeper look at the brain , one of the things , if you look at it in cross-section , what you can see is that you can &apos;t really see a whole lot of structure there .
and so in this trailer i took it upon myself to think about travel , and escape , in an idiosyncratic sense .
i have a wonderful husband , a wonderful husband who supports me despite all the criticism he gets from the society .
you can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem , even if the problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism .
can you see here what japan did ?
in ethiopia , for example , the variation in maize prices from year to year is as much as 50 percent annually .
( applause ) so , very briefly , i &apos;ll just explain to you how this is done , because that &apos;s the more interesting part .
this is a woman who is now working at the orphanage , whose son had been adopted .
does anyone know what this is ?
and you can think of it in terms of a game-theoretic payoff matrix .
since you have to pay for the nurse anyway , the cost per immunization ends up being cheaper if you give incentives than if you don &apos;t .
i made a stacking board .
i plug in again the power to it .
( music ) ( applause )
and what &apos;s amazing is , even though we flew very high above this forest , later on in analysis , we can go in and actually experience the treetrops , leaf by leaf , branch by branch , just as the other species that live in this forest experience it along with the trees themselves .
if we can actually have a broader theory of value creation and allow us to actually admit what the state has been doing and reap something back , it might just be that in the next round , and i hope that we all hope that the next big revolution will in fact be green , that that period of growth will not only be smart , innovation-led , not only green , but also more inclusive , so that the public schools in places like silicon valley can actually also benefit from that growth , because they have not .
and with this detailed information about the real quality of life in this part of the country , imazon and other partners from government , business and civil society can work together to construct a development plan that will help really improve people &apos;s lives , while protecting that precious global asset that is the amazon rainforest .
at the end of this day i could have filled a book just with stories about law from this one teacher .
and i &apos;m convinced that those who see their world as movable nodes and links really have an edge .
she earns around 12,000 rupees .
three . five . three . five . five . ok .
this is really , in fact , a television broadcasting a show 24 / 7 called &quot; &quot; we &apos;re normal . &quot; &quot; we &apos;re normal , we &apos;re normal , we &apos;re normal , we &apos;re normal , we &apos;re normal .
and that &apos;s why you don &apos;t need to model the glass .
and that was actually an excellent business , because we provided jobs for women all around our neighborhood .
are you restricted by , say , racism , from feeling fully at home where you live ?
and there you see the tail of that great beast wrapping around me .
but i &apos;m not going to the east , because i don &apos;t know swahili .
&quot; i will be swimming around in you for the rest of your life , &quot; i told my slightly horrified sister .
we won &apos;t talk about that anymore . it &apos;s too depressing .
the 300 people below deck were doomed .
if you want to go beyond a tinkering , if you want to go beyond a hobby of robotics and really tackle the grand challenges of robotics through rigorous research we need more than that . this is where school comes in .
so here &apos;s the pitch : i think it &apos;s important that we don &apos;t just get on this freeway to icu without thinking hard about whether or not that &apos;s where we all want to end up , particularly as we become older and increasingly frail and icu has less and less and less to offer us .
and i said , well , in the same way that they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization — and then they all sort of leaned in — they let go of a protein that stops the crystallization .
here , every single student has to engage with the material .
ca : traditional wisdom is that it &apos;s pretty hard for married couples to work together .
and i think it would be important for audiences to demand more buttons on their favorite websites , buttons for example that say , &quot; &quot; if you liked this story , click here to support a cause your storyteller believes in . &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; click here to contribute to your storyteller &apos;s next big idea . &quot; &quot; often , we are committed to the platforms , but not necessarily to the storytellers themselves .
all the human intelligence put in organization design — urban structures , processing systems — what is the real goal ?
and you don &apos;t leave them where they are . you nudge them forward .
i &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re buying one military and you &apos;re operating another , and eventually it &apos;s going to hurt . it &apos;s wrong .
and this is bishop , one of our robots .
now that includes the cost of military and the cost of the fuel both .
my partner , m , who &apos;s a tech guru , hacked wordpress .
she &apos;s got a big smile . she &apos;s got a big personality .
you type in what you want , and it gives you the translation .
the courts have said over and over again , &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need any more intellectual property protection . &quot; &quot; when you look at copies like this , you wonder : how do the luxury high-end brands remain in business ?
there was no inflation .
the point is that the news media preferentially feeds us negative stories because that &apos;s what our minds pay attention to .
the perverse at heart will seek out the ambiguities , trying to create discord by pinning down meanings of their own .
i &apos;ll follow the rats . &quot; &quot; then i started going into the tunnels , which made me realize that there &apos;s a whole new dimension to the city that i never saw before and most people don &apos;t get to see .
when i talk to my students about global issues , and i listen to them in the coffee break , they always talk about &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; them . &quot; &quot; and when they come back into the lecture room i ask them , &quot; &quot; what do you mean with &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; them &quot; &quot; ?
so what should we be doing with that guy &apos;s data ?
visceral is subconscious , you &apos;re unaware of it .
i want you guys to imagine that you &apos;re a soldier running through the battlefield .
and the reason it has a fountain in the courtyard is i wanted one and i had the checkbook , so i bought one and put it there .
now , that &apos;s really tough to do with a hall that has 1,100 seats .
child : our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write .
they enter the queue , they just zip right out .
i &apos;m going to make an argument today that may seem a little bit crazy : social media and the end of gender .
i kind of woke up to this bit in the late &apos; 90s when i met this guy .
and meditation or self-inspection is one of the ways — again it &apos;s not the only one — it &apos;s one of the ways of gaining this kind of inner power .
there &apos;s an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there , experiencing the sun &apos;s demise , but any life and intelligence that exists then will be as different from us as we are from bacteria .
he would send me a fax and show me something .
the next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of jam .
everything else on there is a labor of love .
so let &apos;s take an example that we all face : chat — text messaging .
if you had told me that this smart , funny , sensitive man who adored me would one day dictate whether or not i wore makeup , how short my skirts were , where i lived , what jobs i took , who my friends were and where i spent christmas , i would have laughed at you , because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in conor at the beginning .
so go away from your comfort into a bigger , brighter thing , because that is how we will stop another ferguson from happening .
what about africa &apos;s population ? the population isn &apos;t out of proportion to its area , but africa leads the world in deaths from often preventable causes : malnutrition , simple infections and birth complications .

secondly , drug companies are not going to develop really sophisticated psychoactive drugs . we know that most mental illnesses have a biological component that can be dealt with .
and i can get really despairing . i &apos;ve spent a lot of the last few years really depressed about this , until this year , i learned something that i felt really excited about . i feel like it &apos;s really good news , and it &apos;s so shocking , i don &apos;t like saying it , because i think people won &apos;t believe me .

and i worked in the healthcare industry .
so we &apos;re starting to build a phrase .
and as you noticed , it almost looks around , &quot; &quot; where am i ? &quot; &quot; — and then walks straight to that hole and escapes .
you would agree with me that light doesn &apos;t penetrate through walls .
if i have to ask you who i am , if i have to tell you who i am , if i describe myself in terms of shows and hours of television and how globally badass my brain is , i have forgotten what the real hum is .
he said they were wrong .
and a new generation of engineers and scientists , mostly out of universities , began launching these very small , breadbox-sized satellites called cubesats .
interestingly enough , they also do this with uranium and chromium , and various other toxic metals .
it &apos;s the only spanish innovation , technologically , of the 20th century , by the way .
my parents definitely didn &apos;t think so when i told them at 19 i was quitting my job to pursue this dream career : blue skies , warm tropical beaches , and a tan that lasts all year long .
and these spines don &apos;t always drive you to make the best choices .
and meanwhile , i &apos;m burying myself in the internet looking for specialists .
she claims i have turned myself into a mausoleum , that i am a walking casket , news headlines have turned my identity into a spectacle , bruce jenner on everyone &apos;s lips while the brutality of living in this body becomes an asterisk at the bottom of equality pages .
it &apos;s easiest to see how the technology revolution and globalization are creating this sort of superstar effect in highly visible fields , like sports and entertainment .
if i project that , that would make me think that i would live until 120 if i don &apos;t crash on my motorbike .
i wanted to show you the ways , innocuous as they seem , in which we &apos;re incorporating what we &apos;ve learned about girls — their desires to experience greater emotional flexibility , and to play around with the social complexity of their lives .
we need to find ways of making it happen .
this is the ares team ; we have about 150 scientists , engineers ; where we &apos;re working with jet propulsion laboratory , goddard space flight center , ames research center and half a dozen major universities and corporations in developing this .
and so she ultimately turned to prostitution .
so i started that , and worked in his lab for a year , and found the results that i guess you &apos;d expect to find when you feed fruit flies heavy metals — that it really , really impaired the nervous system .

but today , we need to bring people and their communities back into the heart of the way we design new systems and new services , in an approach that i call &quot; &quot; relational welfare . &quot; &quot; we need to leave behind these old , transactional , unsuitable , outdated models , and we need to adopt instead the shared collective relational responses that can support a family like ella &apos;s , that can address an issue like loneliness , that can support people into work and up the skills curve in a modern labor market , that can also address challenges of education , of health care systems , and so many more of those problems that are pressing on our societies .

he &apos;s doing tricks here , dance tricks , that probably no six-year-old in history ever managed before .
so , up to this point we tried to fix it by using what i call shit-against-the-wall pharmacology , which means , well , let &apos;s just throw chemicals at it , and maybe it &apos;s going to make it work .

so wilkins said he thought it was the helix .
now the interesting thing is , reputation is the socioeconomic lubricant that makes collaborative consumption work and scale , but the sources it will be generated from , and its applications , are far bigger than this space alone .

he was on coumadin .
so , in a short period of time , we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of &quot; &quot; what is life ? &quot; &quot; we truly , you know , have modest goals of replacing the whole petrol-chemical industry — ( laughter ) ( applause ) yeah . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where can you ? — ( laughter ) become a major source of energy ...

we &apos;ve been revealing this information through technical workshops .
so i think it &apos;s actually very empowering for homeowners and businesses .
it &apos;s in the eye of the beholder .
this , no doubt , is the reason why a million people a week are gathering in cities .
the vocabulary used in those books and the style of writing .
the water then seeps over the tea .

we were chatting and it was lovely and nice , and i decided to check twitter .
it caused immense celebration in the control room .
and you see me worried and trying to protect my child , because you don &apos;t leave anyone with this kind of child , even a minister .
people were tracking their food via twitter , their kids &apos; diapers on their iphone .
and so we try to ask : what kind of school would have the teenagers fighting to get in , not fighting to stay out ?

as faizan said at the time , if we bow down to the islamists , we &apos;ll just be sitting in a dark corner .
well , this problem , this challenge , is a thing that we must now confront , and i believe that when you have this kind of disengagement , this willful ignorance , it becomes both a cause and a consequence of this concentration of opportunity of wealth and clout that i was describing a moment ago , this profound civic inequality .
and so i sold out way too young .
and when i started out , i thought that architecture was a service business and that you had to please the clients and stuff .
the central truss would expand , with the petals snapping into place .
you should be asking me the question , &quot; &quot; how in the world are we going to test this crazy , science fiction idea , stuck as we are in three dimensions ? &quot; &quot; the way we always do , by slamming together two protons — ( laughter ) hard enough that the collision reverberates into any extra-spatial dimensions that might be there , momentarily creating this hyperdimensional graviton that then snaps back into the three dimensions of the lhc and spits off two photons , two particles of light .
history may be cyclical , but we are singular .
so , i wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is , as if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole .

well , let &apos;s not get carried away .
even when we try to get rid of a technology , it &apos;s actually very hard .
so to show you what i mean , i &apos;m going to do an experiment here with you .
i have been to the mountain top , and i have seen the promised land . &quot; &quot; now , he was a preacher , but i believe the environmental movement and , in fact , the business community , government , needs to go to the top of the mountain top , and it needs to look out , and it needs to see the promised land , or the land of promise , and it needs to have a vision of a world that we all want .
still life on a rooftop , dead trees in barrels , a bench broken , dogs , excrement , sky .
the dining room looked like this .
he called it staying beginners , and wanted to make sure that we focused on those tiny little details to make them faster , easier and seamless for the new customers .
it took us only seven hours to do the first 470 kilometers of the 500 , but took four , solid hours to do the last only 30 kilometers .
it &apos;s something very personal .
and a few rise to the surface .
( applause ) so we know for our 17,000 managers across ikea that 47 percent are women today , but it &apos;s not enough , and we want to close the gap and follow it all the way through to senior management .
for bonobos and humans alike , life is not just red in tooth and claw .
we &apos;re human , that &apos;s what we do . it &apos;s one of our features .
and you can see from the arrow here indicating &quot; &quot; you are here , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m trying to sort of blend and meld these two very divergent fields of urbanism and ecology , and sort of bring them together in an exciting new way .
each morning , i ride the mini-bus number 11 .
what we rely on is not an incomplete system .
it was modern , high-tech , impressive , a huge 142-foot clear span which , not coincidentally , was exactly its height .

it goes very slowly .
and dane saw the strife that happened as a result of this .
the inside of the nanotubes is so small — the smallest ones are 0.7 nanometers — that it &apos;s basically a quantum world .
thank you .
they just use a different strategy .
and as recently as 15 years ago , there were a lot of scientists who thought these technologies wouldn &apos;t work .
that data is logged . we &apos;re logging about 500 different parameters within the data systems , about 13,000 health parameters and events to say when things are not working the way they should do , and we &apos;re sending that data back to the garage using telemetry at a rate of two to four megabits per second .
maybe because she &apos;s younger , she &apos;s like 25 , she &apos;s able to do this a little bit more easily , but the fact is that maryland voters did pass that marriage equality amendment , and in fact it was the first time that marriage equality was directly voted on and passed by the voters .
think about the kids today in the arab spring , and you see something like this that &apos;s underway .
and so , asks the economist : &quot; the first artificial organism and its consequences . &quot;
if anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades , it &apos;s most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war .
it might have been at the moment of some great , creative inspiration you might have had when you just entered this flow stage .
right now in liberia , what do you see as the main issue that troubles you ?
how come that even people who are poor very much still identify with the idea of choice , the kind of rational idea of choice which we embrace ?
growth was maybe 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 percent , but very slow growth of population and output per capita , whereas the rate of return on capital of course was not zero percent .
the problem is that — let &apos;s say she got pregnant that day , that day — nine months of pregnancy , three months of maternity leave , six months to catch your breath — fast-forward two years , more often — and as i &apos;ve seen it — women start thinking about this way earlier — when they get engaged , or married , when they start thinking about having a child , which can take a long time .
thanks .
and i want to speak a little bit , take us back about 30 years .
kbs : so , the charter of compassion starts right here . street plays , auctions , petitions . i mean , they were changing lives . it was incredible . so , how can we still stay immune ? how can we stay immune to that passion , that energy , that excitement ? i know it &apos;s obvious ,
we have approximately 10 great threads that go from 2 to 17 .
no matter how powerful , data is just a tool , and to keep that in mind , i find this device here quite useful .
a value for things with a personal touch — an autographed book , a soul-searching letter .
so this is great . it simplifies things .
and to this day , i am ambivalent , but when you have instead games like flow , there &apos;s no doubt .
that in order for people to understand the differences between the choices , they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice , and that the consequences need to be felt in a vivid sort of way , in a very concrete way .
the strongman and the human cannonballs reunited , showing off old scars , and new ones .
and aristotle ’ s law of motion was that everything goes to its natural place , which was of course , the rule of the society that aristotle lived in , and more importantly , the medieval society that , through christianity , embraced aristotle and blessed it .
there &apos;s not too much we can see .
and with all sincerity , i can say , i am glad i lived those two years of my life that way , because my goal to not suffer regrets anymore , i got there with that goal .
many of you will know the story .
how much ?
responsibility and desire just butt heads .
being solemn is easy .
the landscape is incredible .
anybody who ever gave anything to africa got a lot more back .
it &apos;s being safe in the world .
( music ) okay , and so , i think from the experience of building a lot of instruments for the laptop orchestra , and i think from the curiosity of wondering , what if we took these hopefully expressive instruments and we brought it to a lot of people , plus then a healthy bout of insanity — put those three things together — led to me actually co-founding a startup company in 2008 called smule .
no movement in the wage gap for women in the united states .
people wiggle a lot and getting these variations identified with very high accuracy , both in precision and recall , is tough because that &apos;s what it takes to get a professional coach to believe in you .
and as you can see from the visuals , the service was responding and rescuing victims from the incident locations even before the police could cordon off the incident locations and formally confirm it as a terror strike .
and conservatives tend to endorse values like loyalty , patriotism , respect for authority and moral purity more than liberals do .
so i said , extracellular matrix , which is this stuff called ecm , signals and actually tells the cells what to do .
thanks , gentlemen . ( applause ) so what have we done here ?
and that really has to do to many different challenges .
i can &apos;t actually sit with my foreign minister or my prime minister again with a smile on my face and do what i used to do gladly for them .
so the guy kind of reluctantly let us in and we sat down on the floor .
after 30 days of sleepless nights , she finally capitulated and raised the grade .
em : sure . so , in order to accelerate the advent of electric transport , and i should say that i think , actually , all modes of transport will become fully electric with the ironic exception of rockets .
so it &apos;s early days , to be upfront , but we &apos;re excited about it .
learning to be creative within the confines of our limitations is the best hope we have to transform ourselves and , collectively , transform our world .
it is in the real-world performance of the street .
it might free up some parking spots , but it will not end terrorism .
but the amazing thing about cities is they &apos;re worth so much more than it costs to build them .
nelson mandela — i take a little piece of limestone from robben island prison , where he labored for 27 years , and came out with so little bitterness , he could lead his people from the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath .
this is what you look like . this is one of your chromosomes .
in fact , it is a business that has grown threefold over the past 15 years .
and schrodinger said the essence was information present in our chromosomes , and it had to be present on a molecule . i &apos;d never really thought of molecules before .
and you were supposed to think , well , the state legislature was rural-controlled , and they hated the big city , so rather than putting the capital in a big city , they put it in a county seat .
he said , &quot; &quot; everything i &apos;ve been telling you for the last 20 years , forget about it . it was wrong .
in fact , i loved the movie , how they duplicated all my projects .
it &apos;s comprised of ideas and narratives and symbols and leaders .
on dry days , some colonies forage less , so colonies are different in how they manage this trade-off between spending water to search for seeds and getting water back in the form of seeds .
one of my closest friends , okoloma , died in a plane crash because our fire trucks did not have water .
we have major challenges , you can imagine , to finish this job , but as you &apos;ve also seen , it &apos;s doable , it has great secondary benefits , and polio eradication is a great buy .
and he pointed to the busloads of tourists that would show up everyday , with cameras ready usually .
so why don &apos;t you give them a little history — just a tickle — a bit of history of where it comes from .
for my part , what i wanted us to do was just to look at terrorism as though it was a global brand , say , coca-cola .
you have to think about things like pause points .
wk : in fact , a design of the windmill that was in the book , it has got four — ah — three blades , and mine has got four blades .
thank you very much .
the most severe headaches responded better after we did it several times , and the unexpected finding indicates that even established headaches , not only those with aura , get treated and get diminished .
so there &apos;s a place for math and physics and all that there .
and she said , &quot; &quot; well , you don &apos;t have to do that again . &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; and then she said , &quot; &quot; but how does it happen when a man and woman are together ?
i mean , my all-time classic is another &quot; &quot; come here &quot; &quot; one .
they &apos;ve said it &apos;s just metadata , it &apos;s just metadata , and they &apos;re talking about a specific legal authority called section 215 of the patriot act .
in weather , the feelings assume the physical characteristics of the weather that they represent , so that the ones collected on a sunny day swirl around as if they &apos;re part of the sun .
what did you like best about being in congress ?
and what they found is that they think that we know of about nine percent of the species in the ocean .
is it going to land where it &apos;s supposed to ?
the second is , do blogs genuinely have the possibility of accessing a kind of collective intelligence that has previously remained , for the most part , untapped ?
if you can plan it like a project , you can plan what resources you need and you can execute it , exactly like a project .
not every asylum seeker is lucky like me .
but everybody agreed to play a game where the worst sketch artist bought the next round of drinks .

ak : so in 1981 , i persuaded basil and some friends of mine to form a puppet company .
that personal experience with the use of race in genetic testing got me thinking : where else in medicine is race used to make false biological predictions ?
regret doesn &apos;t remind us that we did badly .
the overall time that we have for our narrative , our lifespan , has been increasing , but the smallest measure , the moment , has shrunk .
( laughter ) there &apos;s very few times you &apos;d be happy to find this on your car , but it did seem to indicate that we were coming back .
he said that he was in agony and wanted to get a gun so he could end his life .
imagine , for example , you &apos;re the captain of a cruise ship trying to make your way through a thick fog and some passenger in the back turns on a wave bubble .
and maybe i even want to interview him first , because there are more people who refer to him .
it will stop because of the growing demand of us on all the resources , all the capacity , all the systems of the earth , which is now having economic damage .
here every gesture needs intention , is alive with consciousness .
the most venomous animal that lives in the ocean is the box jellyfish .
we have to look over generations to understand it .
what if the bombs are just simply wake-up calls for us ?
he was actually living in the kibera slums when his father called him and told him about artemisia and the value-add potential .
or we &apos;re , &quot; &quot; oh , yeah , this party , let me take a picture . &quot; &quot; but we rarely do that when we &apos;re having a bad day , and something horrible is happening .
dh : we will juggle seven .
you look at that lane on the right .
we have to find a way to meet our needs , while making of this place an eden .
now , instead of crude tools made of sticks and stones , israel now had iron plows , and sickles , and hoes and military weapons .
people who are good are at the top , bad at the bottom .
but when that food is there , it &apos;s transformative .
( laughter ) so when that happens — this works in keynote , powerpoint , it works in every program — all you do is hit the letter b key , b for blackout , to black out the slide , make everybody look at you , and then when you &apos;re ready to go on , you hit b again , and if you &apos;re really on a roll , you can hit the w key for &quot; &quot; whiteout , &quot; &quot; and you white out the slide , and then you can hit w again to un-blank it .
our pact with our patients , the hippocratic oath and its variants , is about the sanctity of the patient-doctor relationship .
the actors were right there in front of us , right there among the commuters , and we could hear them , but we might not have otherwise seen them .
some of them are about the animals , the number .
every man deserves the opportunity to grow a little bit of luxury .
film , it &apos;s an incredible medium , but essentially , it &apos;s the same now as it was then .
and this was something that was really brought home to me a year ago when i found out i was pregnant and the first scan revealed that my baby had a birth defect associated with exposure to estrogenic chemicals in the womb and the second scan revealed no heartbeat .
second one : can you light a little torch-bulb with a battery bulb and one piece of wire ?
i can remember speaking to a 12-year-old boy , a football player , and i asked him , i said , &quot; &quot; how would you feel if , in front of all the players , your coach told you you were playing like a girl ? &quot; &quot; now i expected him to say something like , i &apos;d be sad ; i &apos;d be mad ; i &apos;d be angry , or something like that .
but if compassion was fun , everybody &apos;s going to do it .
but help was on the way , and shortly afterwards a car arrived from the swiss embassy .
what do you fear ?
two hundred years ago , the united states was less than a few percent urbanized .
and finally , in the shade under the mirrors , it &apos;s possible to grow all sorts of crops that would not grow in direct sunlight .
putting all the data together , what we found is that , contrary to popular opinion , looting did not start to get worse in egypt in 2011 after the arab spring , but in 2009 , after the global recession .
and we came up with econol .
and as we like to say — and i know there are a lot of americans in the audience here — if americans want to live the american dream , they should go to denmark .
could we get the balloon to talk directly to handsets , so that we didn &apos;t need the antenna as an intermediary receiver ?
and then we had this one event that stays in my heart forever where a basketball coach was talking to a room filled with male athletes and men from all walks of life .
it &apos;s really difficult . so we &apos;re still having to rely on illegitimate ways of getting information , through leaks .
serena , a 32-year-old accountant , says that it &apos;s important to her for her doctor to share her values when it comes to reproductive choice and women &apos;s rights .
it took many millions of years before these bright lights evolved into a smart communication tool that could be used not just to ward off potential predators but to bring in potential mates .
now when this works , it &apos;s because there are large institutions underwriting every 1 or 0 that changes on a computer .
on the left-hand panel , again , we have the s-shaped curve of adoption .
we must ban the deployment and development of killer robots .
durga , resplendent , bedecked , beautiful , her 18 arms ready for warfare , as she rode astride her lion into the battlefield to destroy mahishasur .
bc : edl is this immense , technically challenging problem .
put your book beneath it and you can read .
we &apos;re going to talk — my — a new lecture , just for ted — and i &apos;m going show you some illusions that we &apos;ve created for ted , and i &apos;m going to try to relate this to happiness . what i was thinking about with happiness is , what gives happiness — or happiness , which i equate with joy in my particular area , and i think there &apos;s something very fundamental . and i was thinking about this . and it &apos;s in terms of both illusions and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows is that there &apos;s something about these things where our expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing
the first is cloning .
the current king of the romantics , who approaches his work in a very different fashion .
a part of me had become alienated from myself .
so , i &apos;m swimming along , and it takes off my leg .
so thousands and thousands of people have taken this test online , so we have results .
it &apos;s not as if i had any idea what it would look like , but there was a sense that we would have to do something with new categories of workers and something having to do with behavior change and something having to do with public education .
but if i ask them , is the ted website going to go down ?
what picasso did , for example , was take the concept &quot; &quot; western art &quot; &quot; and the concept &quot; &quot; african masks &quot; &quot; and blend them together — not only the geometry , but the moral systems entailed in them .
so now , what i &apos;ve been working on for the last four years is to develop smart biomaterials , which are actually materials that will work with the body , helping it to heal and helping it to allow the wounds to heal normally .
and six months later , we sat down at kennedy space center .
and when we talked to her , she said that when she was undergoing chemotherapy , she had to go to the hospital every month for her infusions .
so , now we have , immediately , a real-time map showing where there are refugee camps — rapidly became the best map to use if you &apos;re doing relief work in port-au-prince .
here , let me give you an analogy .
so , the electromagnetic force , the force that holds us together , gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures .
thank you .
now , we have lots of people who are doing this already , and we &apos;ve talked a little bit about the educational side .
they said , &quot; &quot; every day we have patients that come into the clinic — child has an ear infection , i prescribe antibiotics .
so the question becomes , what drives men &apos;s support for women &apos;s rights ?
most of the kids i was seeing had experienced such severe trauma that it felt like something else was going on .
trickster is a change agent .
men were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women , that &apos;s essentially what it is .
so we have had tremendous success , and we kind of got caught up in our own success quite a bit , and we started using expressions like &quot; &quot; lifesaving . &quot; &quot; i really apologize to everybody for doing that , because obviously , we don &apos;t .
studies show that antioxidants are known to decrease these heterocyclic amines .
now lol , we generally think of as meaning &quot; &quot; laughing out loud . &quot; &quot; and of course , theoretically , it does , and if you look at older texts , then people used it to actually indicate laughing out loud .
but the mother lode of discoveries on enceladus was found at the south pole — and we &apos;re looking at the south pole here — where we found this system of fractures .
so i started cold-calling , and eventually got through to sue savage-rumbaugh , and she invited me down .
now the viability threshold is reached , and the frequency distribution has dramatically changed and , in fact , stabilizes .
anyway — sorry .
&quot; look closely at the most embarrassing details . amplify them . &quot;
this is mass general in boston .
the real way that i became a model is i won a genetic lottery , and i am the recipient of a legacy , and maybe you &apos;re wondering what is a legacy .
so it &apos;s not all bad news . i mean , there definitely is progress on the line , but i think what we find is that the closer that we get right into the heart of power , the more opaque , closed it becomes .
if i know when i was young , that &#91; by &#93; killing an elephant , i &apos;m destroying biodiversity , i would not have done it .
and i will go you one further .
i had to do something .
and that &apos;s felony murder — 25 to life , parole at 50 if you &apos;re lucky , and tony &apos;s not feeling very lucky .
and &#91; with &#93; that you will get two extra , but that won &apos;t change the energy use very much .
and one of the ways that you can think about repairing your fracture is this procedure here , called an iliac crest harvest .

jh : give me a story of a tool you created at the beginning in second life that you were pretty sure people would want to use in the creation of their avatars or in communicating that people actually in practice said , no , i &apos;m not interested in that at all , and name something that you didn &apos;t come up with that almost immediately people began to demand .
you can say &quot; &quot; weather , &quot; &quot; and the name of the city you &apos;re going to travel to .
but i &apos;ll ask you guys to stand up so we celebrate the life of a british aid worker called emma mccune that made it possible for me to be here .
maybe they are the lucky ones .
green is the sort of cool areas where it &apos;s not turned on .
well , what did we do ? we said , we can make a website , we can make an expert network , a social network , that would connect the network to the institution to allow scientists and technologists to get better information to the patent office to aid in making those decisions .
and then we founded a mission-driven company , and we &apos;re developing kits to make it easier for anyone with a sink and a soldering iron to make these things at home .
i mean , but we don &apos;t have a concept of that .
it &apos;s called batting average .
experimentally , this is what we &apos;ve done in the last year .
and we ask them questions that are actually not really answerable , the types of questions that 9 / 11 itself draws forth for all of us .
in other words , if you put onto the roads , as is currently happening , 1,000 new cars every day — statistically , it &apos;s the biggest booming auto market in the world — and the half a billion bicycles serving one and a third billion people are reducing .
&quot; there is no justice in the world . there is some justice in the world . the world is just . &quot;
( applause )
the first words of whole earth discipline are , &quot; &quot; we are as gods , and have to get good at it . &quot; &quot; thank you .
and the idea was to create some self-moving benches in the main exhibition room .
this is an area today that has very few regulations and even fewer rules .
rng : so , do you think it &apos;s human nature that &apos;s changed ?
now unlike a human-designed computer , where there &apos;s a fairly small number of different parts — we know how they work , because we humans designed them — the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells , maybe tens of thousands .
if nothing else , you realize very quickly as a teenager , it is not a hit with girls to know captain kirk &apos;s middle name .
the passion with which we &apos;ve been singing the national anthem since we were kids .
they just want you to tell us what you &apos;re feeling , what you &apos;re thinking , and get into the solution .
it was beyond the technology of the day to depict a man aging backwards .
when things were so intense , when cnn international was broadcasting live from istanbul , cnn turkey instead was broadcasting a documentary on penguins .
that &apos;s what we do .
something &apos;s gotta be working up there .
we &apos;re near the end , we &apos;re getting close to the world series .
could we start to share our intelligence ?
and i think we &apos;re almost there .
and we &apos;re taking these films , and we &apos;re showing them at the united nations to people that work there and people that are visiting there .
this purchase included mining and hunting rights , ownership of all land on the island , and a castle with no furniture included .
they folded samosas for our entire mosque .
the second component might be the stomach .
so we see again , climate change is large : nairobi , global conference , environmental .
that is a public act of making media .
and these are some of the cells that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy .
it &apos;s 10 by 10 by 30 centimeters , it weighs four kilograms , and we &apos;ve stuffed the latest and greatest electronics and sensor systems into this little package so that even though this is really small , this can take pictures 10 times the resolution of the big satellite here , even though it weighs one thousandth of the mass .
&#91; &quot; &quot; you &apos;re welcome &quot; &quot; &#93; ( laughter ) ( applause )
world war ii changed a lot of things , and one of them was this need to protect people from becoming victims of medical research without informed consent .
instead , they use tools like skype , which they think are immune to interception .
alive .
and this is the idea that science magazine used on their front cover .
this kogi doesn &apos;t exist . it &apos;s a moving truck . right ?
it &apos;s a fantastic example , a simple object .
then the nest maintenance workers work inside the nest , and i wanted to say that the nests look a lot like bill lishman &apos;s house .
it has to be investing in low-carbon technologies and infrastructures .
now why are people using it ?
we made it learn from us , and we set it free in the desert .
there were other people in the room .
they are the most remarkable animals i &apos;ve ever worked with , and the same with polar bears .
glenn greenwald : you know , i think one of the things that happens is that people &apos;s courage in this regard gets contagious , and so although i and the other journalists with whom i was working were certainly aware of the risk — the united states continues to be the most powerful country in the world and doesn &apos;t appreciate it when you disclose thousands of their secrets on the internet at will — seeing somebody who is a 29-year-old ordinary person who grew up in a very ordinary environment exercise the degree of principled courage that edward snowden risked , knowing that he was going to go to prison for the rest of his life
in one case , i flew all the way to malaga with a team because the thing was signed with seals and various very official seals from the city , and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port .
it is the team , and it &apos;s also the community that uses this technology in ways that we could not foresee .
and here you have the types of explanations that they provide for some of their actions .
it works like this : you take a brain , or parts of that brain , and you dissolve it in detergent , which destroys the cell membranes but keeps the cell nuclei intact , so you end up with a suspension of free nuclei that looks like this , like a clear soup .
our poetry is our mutation , our life .
do you have any worries about that industry , and perhaps the financial industry in general ?
( applause ) play video one .
they were amazing — like you can see here .
who would ever have thought you could have your own eeg at your home , tagged to a very nice alarm clock , by the way ?
final story , we also built a computer .
the high speed was 16 kilocycles .
here &apos;s a site which allows you to look at recovery spending in california .
but they asked one question . they said , &quot; &quot; is this repeatable ? &quot; &quot; that was a fair question because my memoir was simply how i found solutions that worked for me .
if you take all the nuclear waste we &apos;ve ever made in the united states , put it on a football field , stacked it up , it would only reach 20 feet high .
now i can tell you , in my own industry , at ariel investments , we actually view our diversity as a competitive advantage , and that advantage can extend way beyond business .
most of what &apos;s extracted from our end-of-life stuff , if it makes it to a recycler , are the metals .
well if you get the kiss now , it &apos;s over and done with .
a year and a half ago , four of the five people who are full time members at ushahidi , which means &quot; &quot; testimony &quot; &quot; in swahili , were ted fellows .
and this really shows that the spinal cord is a very sophisticated locomotion controller .
that is not just an abstract proposition .
and the thing about it is that we have well and truly proven the nanopatch within the laboratory setting .
so here &apos;s an example : one recent study took two groups of agnostics , that is people who are undecided in their religious beliefs .
that it is amazing that connection we can have with what &apos;s there .
we have no written record . well , actually , we do .
so you have to keep on top of the business .
he was caught by dedicated , resourceful , brilliant people in partnerships with various technologies .
you &apos;re helping him discover the garden by just pointing out these snails .
they &apos;re hidden in plain sight .
and i have done this throughout my work .
take 59 away from 60 , and you ’ re left with the one .
why not helen mirren ? she &apos;s a great actor . why not ? &quot; &quot; and this material really did work for a woman equally as well .
when they were interviewed after the study , all the participants said that they firmly believed that the learning and punishment study served a worthy scientific purpose which would have enduring gains for science as opposed to the momentary nonfatal discomfort caused to the participants .
we believe in risk awareness .
now , i showed this to a physicist friend of mine who has a profound distaste for biology , and he says , &quot; &quot; that ’ s easy ! the things are a different color ! &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) we have to go a little beyond that . now let me explain why vibrational theory has some sort of interest in it . these molecules , as you saw in the beginning , the building blocks had springs connecting them to each other .
bj : and of course , through the night , they lay together .
but you know , sort of &quot; &quot; our brains have been manipulated ; we &apos;re all addicts . &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; addiction &quot; &quot; is thrown around .
and we &apos;re now , with satellite dishes , pulling and analyzing a good part of all the tv being watched in the united states .
thank you for joining us .
and yet , how did it start ?
and one of the things we tend to do as adults , again , is we edit things .
as a kid , i was fascinated with all things air and space .
we do have to see this as a deadly battlefield .
and this was an inspiration to me .
open defecation is rampant .
they even called it &quot; &quot; he &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; she , &quot; &quot; whereas people with the calculated brain called it &quot; &quot; it , &quot; &quot; and nobody ever called it &quot; &quot; he &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; she . &quot; &quot; when they talked about it after the task , with the adventurous brain , they said , &quot; &quot; by the end , we were good friends and high-fived mentally . &quot; &quot; whatever that means .
well , steve noticed that and he said , &quot; we &apos;re not going to let that happen to our product . &quot;
since it &apos;s organic , i &apos;m really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals .
but not as the guy on the table ; the guy doing open-heart surgery .
and , perhaps most important , as teachers , we should strive to be the ordinary heroes , the moral exemplars , to the people we mentor .
they said that is the dumbest thing you &apos;ve ever said .
no ? now ?
ordinarily , the pendulum would just swing back into the other direction .
they &apos;re psychiatrists .
that &apos;s what happened to me when i noticed that we are moving from passive consumers to creators , to highly enabled collaborators .
and then the next light bulb was , better than just writing , what about film and tv , to get out to people in a big way ?
by the time the next election comes , i believe every candidate will have to disclose where they stand on the abolition of fossil fuels .
a space that doesn &apos;t always follow us like a dog that has been trained to follow us , but moves ahead into directions of demonstrating other possibilities , other experiences , that have never been part of the vocabulary of architecture .
so this is mr. perry . he &apos;s the assistant superintendent .
there was an article which was run by ap , on the wire .
text messaging : that was originally designed for people who are deaf .
so , that &apos;s very intuitive , and that &apos;s what we want .
if we could do that , this could be extremely powerful .
democracy matters because it reflects an idea of equality and an idea of liberty . it reflects an idea of dignity , the dignity of the individual , the idea that each individual should have an equal vote , an equal say , in the formation of their government .
suppose that two american friends are traveling together in italy .
this is the situation in qatar , for those who don &apos;t know .
( applause ) i was trying to think of the right model to describe this form of random acts of kindness by geeky strangers .
now what about goals ? where are we going toward ?
maria was in a car accident , and she woke up on her 16th birthday to the news that she was a complete quadriplegic , had no movement from the neck down , had damage to her vocal chords , and she couldn &apos;t talk .
all right . so , like all good stories , this starts a long , long time ago when there was basically nothing .
lidia yuknavitch : i &apos;m making a confession : i stole three linen napkins — ( laughter ) from three different restaurants .
it &apos;s called retro-vaccinology , and its implications extend way beyond that of just hiv .
tr : ninety-nine . well , that &apos;s an improvement .
so we tried to come up with a way , as a group , to have a kind of design swat team .
so the best that our little savings accounts or retirement accounts can do is to try to catch some waves in the good cycles and hope that we don &apos;t get inundated in the turbulent ones , but certainly our decisions on how to steer our little retirement accounts don &apos;t affect the tides , don &apos;t change the shape or size or direction of the waves .
so we began with a card table in the clinic waiting room — totally lemonade stand style .
but he &apos;s about to dispel the gloom by using those bright colors right underneath noah : emerald , topaz , scarlet on the prophet zechariah .
your pupils dilate , your muscles contract , your spidey sense tingles , basically your whole body is trigger-happy . ( laughter ) that condition is not conducive to performing folk music . ( laughter )
he said , that &apos;s what flutes are for — to be played well .
now , if we do that , if we put the resources and the focus to it , what does it actually cost to get people out of slavery ?
this , of course , is not true for the students who graduate from the top institutions , but for many others , they do not get the value for their time and their effort .
i met women running essential oils businesses , wineries and even the country &apos;s largest advertising agency .
let &apos;s look at some videos of what happened when we tested these new drugs in worms .
africa has been good to us ; it is time for us to give back to africa .
( english ) omer my brother , i will always love you .
we was so , so stupid . the most stupid bacteria .
but in gay men , you &apos;ve got quite a dramatic rise starting three or four years after treatment became widely available .
but in the last few decades that has totally changed .
except for my son , who said , &quot; &quot; well , he could have two dads . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) ( applause ) that &apos;s an index , an indicator of how things have changed .
somebody get the front legs .
and what do we teach in these schools ?
i study how the brain processes information . that is , how it takes information in from the outside world , and converts it into patterns of electrical activity , and then how it uses those patterns to allow you to do things — to see , hear , to reach for an object .
so it was pretty obvious after this process that , well , we chicken out here and go away because it &apos;s too tense , or we go even further in asking , what else is bothering you ?
they use these to design with and they design for them , which is why we end up sitting in restaurants that look like this — ( loud crowd noise ) — and sound like this , shouting from a foot away to try and be heard by our dinner companion , or why we get on airplanes — ( flight attendant announcements ) — which cost 200 million pounds , with somebody talking through an old-fashioned telephone handset on a cheap stereo system , making us jump out of our skins .
and if it isn &apos;t then it produces a shape which is very phonaesthetically tightly coupled to the sounds you made .
we can &apos;t pick the future , but we can steer the future .
shared memories — that &apos;s where the old bbc building was ; and personal memories — that &apos;s where i gave my first kiss .
in 2001 , this building received an award .
owl , yeah .
doctor , whatever you say , i accept it .
and what was really great is , i &apos;m putting all this work together in the background , and laura sent me a follow-up email because a good month had passed by .
and that is a slide taken from a tv set and it was pre-processed to be very sympathetic to the tv medium , and it absolutely looks beautiful .
we &apos;re doing this at the cedars-sinai heart institute in the women &apos;s heart center .
1.1 million of them .
it &apos;s saturday . it &apos;s the holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot; because i have to exchange your father &apos;s underwear . &quot;
now imagine what these already ingenious communities could create themselves , and how highly particular their solutions would be , if they were given the basic infrastructures that they could tap into .
( laughter ) this science is different , more general , than the mathematics-based science that we &apos;ve had for the past 300 or so years .
and so that gives you an idea of how exquisitely sensitive this is .
the maasais , the boys are brought up to be warriors .
well , i was very sorry to point out that the pure man &apos;s mind has , in fact , seen at long last what had been seen for a long time .
well , &quot; &quot; rare earth &quot; &quot; actually taught me an awful lot about meeting the public .
and that &apos;s good , it gets two plusses .
what they do best is make a synthesis of human needs , current conditions in economy , in materials , in sustainability issues , and then what they do at the end — if they are good — is much more than the sum of its parts .
so this also works for the house , for at home .
we make it ourselves .
the instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification , etc . , etc .
ca : ed , thank you .
now you might ask yourself , how did he do that ?
so the first example i &apos;m going to talk about relates to children with learning impairments .
and obviously he never came down . the statement was never made .
we were living through a time of tectonic shifts in ideologies , in politics , in religion , in populations .
but i &apos;ll try to convince you that spectroscopy is actually something which can change this world .
it &apos;s been a privilege talking to you .
so we took these hundred dollar bills , and we put them on a website called tenthousandscents.com , where you can browse through and see all the individual contributions .
fold .
now , you might think , well , we &apos;re human because of our dna , but it turns out that each of us has about 20,000 human genes , depending on what you count exactly , but as many as two million to 20 million microbial genes .
this fabrication of place could be one of the world &apos;s greatest achievements , because no one belongs here ; everyone does .
let &apos;s say the revenue of microsoft .
some dancers , when they &apos;re watching action , take the overall shape , the arc of the movement , the kinetic sense of the movement , and use that for memory .
now i cannot tell you how incredibly excited the u.s. military was by the news of the norden bombsight .
and , of course , graphics : today 84 dollars and 97 cents at best buy buys you more graphics power than you could have gotten for a million bucks from sgi only a decade ago .
and those are the questions that inspired my new project , which is debuting here today at ted .
( laughter ) just for my workshop .
and the purpose is not to walk in and construct a home and live there .
these structures are called cilia , and they actually move the mucus out of the lung .
so it &apos;s very well known to engineers , not as well known to biologists .
and what &apos;s exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors who are building innovations that recognize that what people want is freedom and choice and opportunity .
and one of the reasons is , in south africa , it costs 100 dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity .
but you &apos;re going to get home and realize how different life is . &quot; &quot; and i got home and something happened .
they carried me around and put me on the table , and put the knife between my legs .
two million years ago humans evolved in africa and then slowly but surely spread out across the entire planet by reaching into the wilderness that was beyond their horizons .
and why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now ?
on 9 / 11 , joel wasn &apos;t in new york . he was out of town , but he raced back to the city , and raced down to the site of the destruction .
they teach us about what happens in the complex organism .
and so for me , a mesh company , the &quot; &quot; classic &quot; &quot; mesh company , brings together these three things : our ability to connect to each other — most of us are walking around with these mobile devices that are gps-enabled and web-enabled — allows us to find each other and find things in time and space .
and again , we can see it in slightly different form there , with the bubble forming and collapsing between those two surfaces .
so we came up with one neighborhood typology — there are several — called a live-make neighborhood , where folks could reappropriate abandoned structures and turn them into entrepreneurial enterprises , with a specific emphasis on looking at the , again , majority 82 percent african-american population .
so that &apos;s , as i said , the little diversion on my main love .
i turn them into two and three-dimensional pieces and sculptures and installations .
it &apos;s as though you made something resonate within them .
or maybe it was 31 and a quarter percent .
let me give you another example of delegation .
particularly if we continue to approach the transformation of organizations the way we always have been .
life in space is really not necessarily about how we do things , but why we do things .
there &apos;s a much deeper connection , which i don &apos;t have time to go into and that is that modern genetics is a really exciting area of science .
here &apos;s the second reason .
they also kiss , hold hands , pat one another on the back .
you need to understand that in those places what really mattered was , firstly , the role of tudman and milosevic in coming to the agreement , and then the fact those men went , that the regional situation improved , that the european union could offer bosnia something extraordinary : the chance to be part of a new thing , a new club , a chance to join something bigger .
now , that &apos;s the good news .
the kids of today , they tap , swipe and pinch their way through the world .
and immediately , a lot of different responsibilities , in terms of my education and so forth , were heaped upon me .
and scientists have a lot of theories about why this is , but almost all of them involve nutrition , namely the increase of dairy and meat .
you look outside : you have all that beauty that you see , all that life that you see around you , and here we have intelligent people like you and i who are having a conversation here .
thank you very much .
if you go on the streets of india and china , you see this kind of stuff .
they also get free land in between the trees , where they can grow their crops .
they did not have any pardas inside their body , hijabs inside themselves ; they &apos;ve crossed the barrier of it .
they sit , they watch the goldfish in the fish tank , they read extremely old copies of good housekeeping magazine .
on the graph paper , you can see how all the lines on the graph paper have been distorted .
since there was nothing there , you might as well not look .
if you wanted to put all of the published works online so that anybody could have it available , well , how big a problem is it ?
( applause ) but something as basic as happiness , which 20 years ago would have been just something for discussion in the church or mosque or synagogue , today it turns out that there &apos;s dozens of ted-like questions that you can ask about it , which are really interesting .
i did it for your own good .
and so they did .
this simulation was run on 1,000 processors for a month in order to make just this simple visible one .
the architecture is telling a story . the architecture is telling a story
that &apos;s the alliance that changes the world .
we set out to do this .
their job is to get things done , and if they don &apos;t , they &apos;re out of a job .
it was a bunch of people who wanted to bring in democracy because they wanted to bring in the idea of universal voting and parliament and constitution and so forth .
and that &apos;s what happens to currencies when you don &apos;t stand behind them .
now , think about where the world would be today if we had the light bulb , but you couldn &apos;t focus light ; if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to .
dude , are you from canada ? ( laughter ) so , like , whatever , with grand theft auto , you &apos;re this kid , like , you &apos;re this guy walking around or whatever , and you can basically , like , the more cops you kill , the more points you get , and stuff like that .
sub-surface water on mars , frozen in the form of ice .
the fundamental issue is that , for me , design is the first signal of human intentions .
that is a bit counterintuitive .
were there things that weren &apos;t being done ?
the thing that was always striking to me was that we as people could have so many really amazing ideas about things we &apos;d like to do , but are so often unable , in the real world , to actually do those things — to actually cobble together the materials and go through the actual execution phase of building something that you imagine from a design perspective .
and i certainly don &apos;t know all the people who might be watching this talk over the internet , somewhere in buenos aires or in new delhi .
the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually scale by strengthening civil society .
( laughter ) we can build a better vine .
columns are architectural archetypes .
so i thought , three words for one concept . this is not good .
we know looting is going on on a global scale and it &apos;s increasing , but presently we don &apos;t have any tools to stop it .
that &apos;s my mom .
and they will need chemistry . that &apos;s the point .
so , it &apos;s a normal-looking syringe .
the damage comes in the form of a double-strand break through the double helix .
and it &apos;s specifically algorithms , which are basically the math that computers use to decide stuff .
each of the 188 members of the imf hold sdr quotas as part of their foreign exchange reserves .
turns out , all he wanted to do was to stack the siftables up .
and my mother bought this book when we were at the grand canyon called &quot; &quot; the hot zone . &quot; &quot; it was all about the outbreak of the ebola virus .
this shift has created what professor nicolaus mills calls a culture of humiliation .
pity , i would have told them it was the ace of spades .
so i went on for the next 20 years or so making a lot of different games .
they need jobs in the public health sector or in nonprofit health centers to put their training and commitment to work .
we collect four gigabits per second of data , if you can imagine that kind of data stream coming down .
at risd , you &apos;re not allowed to draw from an image .
( video ) samantha masters : that &apos;s what &apos;s up , man , this is a righteous man over here .
and this is how we come to care for the common good .
and it &apos;s looking up on the wooded heights of washington heights to jeffrey &apos;s hook , where the george washington bridge goes across today .
and then they talk , and then we pass the baton back and forth between each other .
the support may come in asking people questions , giving them a sheet of paper that has an organizational chart on it or has some guiding images , but we need to support it .
and i couldn &apos;t hear this sound .
and in that time they developed these subtle differences in the genetic architecture behind their blindness .
also , i can imagine many design manufacturers will have to retool their own business plans and maybe invest in this kinko &apos;s store . but it really is a big change .
you know , that &apos;s how you do science .
there was no one to comfort me .
they are hospital ships .
and that &apos;s a good thing to measure in m.s. , because patients with m.s. sadly suffer with problems with vision — loss of vision , unclear vision .
and who would want to tax one &apos;s son ?
( laughter ) this formula works wherever metaphor is present .
but i also am in the fueling business .
and i &apos;ll just do that one more time .
now , in non-tech speak , what that basically means is taking big , multi-year projects and breaking them up into bite-sized chunks , so that way we can reduce the risk and actually start to see results every couple of weeks , instead of waiting in a black box for years .
this jump up in energy in 2015 represented the best chance that we as a species had ever had of discovering new particles — new answers to these long-standing questions , because it was almost twice as much energy as we used when we discovered the higgs boson .
you &apos;d be surprised to know that most of the girls that i have spoken to , who did not know about periods at the time of their first menstruation thought that they have got blood cancer and they &apos;re going to die soon .
what are my options ? what choices are now on the table ?
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
and they can pinch them very tight and stop it , or you can have them wide open .
this is a fundamental question that most of us are asking .
i &apos;d watch those same men walking back home every night .
you know where i &apos;m going with that .
but there is one thing i know how to do : i know how to program a computer .
and just this past february , i won two back-to-back world cup gold medals — ( applause ) — which made me the highest ranked adaptive female snowboarder in the world .
as we know , only half the states have opted in .
so we threw in — we created a primordial soup with lots of pieces of robots — with bars , with motors , with neurons .
and fix it .
reputation will be the currency that says that you can trust me .
no one in my family ever had joined the military at all , and how i first got introduced to the military was when i was 13 years old and i got sent away to military school , because my mother had been threatening me with this idea of military school ever since i was eight years old .
but this complement may be much inferior to what , with other laws and institutions , the nature of its soil , climate , and situation might admit of . &quot; &quot; that is so right and so cool .
once you figure this out , you can really impress people at parties .
a hanger .
even the most data-savvy companies get it wrong .
from a few bones , we infer the existence of dinosuars .
and i have four observations i &apos;d like to share with you today .
♫ i believe the almighty knows each and every one of you ♫ ♫ by your name ♫ ♫ women of hope ♫ ♫ women of change ♫ ♫ women of love , joy , no shame ♫ ♫ you &apos;ve got something this little life ♫ ♫ can never take away ♫ ♫ running through the darkness of night ♫ ♫ with a child by her side ♫ ♫ oh lord , won &apos;t you give them ♫ ♫ a shining armor of light ♫ ♫ oh lord , won &apos;t you give them ♫ ♫ a shining armor of light ♫ ♫ daybreak brings a sign of new life ♫
so the idea here is that the ants are working so hard to hang on to the wall or the floor or whatever you call it that they &apos;re less likely to interact , and so the relationship between how crowded they are and how often they meet would be messed up .
we &apos;ve had good enough , really , very powerful effects with kids around the world , and now people of all ages , using hyperscore .
i &apos;ve met a young man in new york whose illiterate mother in a village in senegal takes a bus once a month to the capital city of dakar , just to watch a bollywood movie .
this is what happens when you route these electrical storms to a loudspeaker and you listen to a hundred brain cells firing , your brain will sound like this — my brain , any brain .
working together is what changes our world .
in 1935 , there were 150,000 cases a year of malaria in the united states , but ddt and a massive public health effort managed to squelch it .
we &apos;ve been able to ensure better futures for the people and the bears .
and then i left .
there &apos;s a flip side as well .
but also , there seems to be a complete sort of gridlock in terms of solving these small solutions .
the only way out of poverty is through business enterprise .
we &apos;ve been more successful in the case of drug policy .
they &apos;re reconstructive .
is it because women don &apos;t look like men , they don &apos;t look like that male-pattern heart disease that we &apos;ve spent the last 50 years understanding and getting really good diagnostics and really good therapeutics , and therefore , they &apos;re not recognized for their heart disease .
but go and look at what is in there .
and one of my favorite robots is leonardo .
kkhh !
we &apos;re 25 , 26 years after the advent of the macintosh , which was an astoundingly seminal event in the history of human-machine interface and in computation in general .
( laughter ) who will start me with $ 1,000 ? anyone ?
unfortunately , such emotion-related facial blood flow changes are too subtle to detect by our naked eye .
( applause ) he refused to be provoked by petty grievances .
ec : right , right .
it calls on us to access that which is most universal and most intimate : a love of our brother and our sister and our neighbor .
does it work ? doesn &apos;t it work ? and so on .
and then i said , carry on . carry on . carry on .
well , you should see some kind of two-legged animal here , and then the mirror image of them there .
the more we saturate our culture with public shaming , the more accepted it is , the more we will see behavior like cyberbullying , trolling , some forms of hacking , and online harassment .
we &apos;ll do some side-by-side comparisons here .
i &apos;m not skiing along drawing maps ; everyone knows where the north pole is .
and i thought to myself : what the hell have i done ?
i know you &apos;ve never heard of him , but just mark this day that someday you will hear of him , because he &apos;s really an amazing man . &quot; &quot; frank gehry : i heard he had some kind of a fling with ingrid bergman . is that true ?
i was just always trying to make things .
and these meetings had this effect while taking under 20 minutes .
thank you .
they targeted to universities .
( laughter ) but i think the biggest conceptual pitfall that cybertopians made is when it comes to digital natives , people who have grown up online .
( applause )
and as we walk in , it is a scene i can only describe you as saying it looked like norway threw up .
( laughter ) so i did the thing .
what is the imagery of god ?
where i couldn &apos;t stop looking .
we repeated the experiment with the same two groups , this time adding a delay between the time we told subjects how we would use their data and the time we actually started answering the questions .
cisgender means the gender i was assigned at birth is still and has always been female .
and it &apos;s fair to say that if we don &apos;t succeed , it &apos;s difficult to see who will .
now that , i would say , is architecture performing .
in 1951 , escher made this drawing . he thought he created an animal fantasy .
if you think 20 percent of genetic information in your nose is a lot of biological dark matter , if we looked at your gut , up to 40 or 50 percent of that information is biological dark matter .
all these choices involve value judgments and social norms , not objective facts .
and i &apos;m your mirror .
it goes into the soil , ending its journey in the lakes , resulting in lakes with extra phosphorus , which leads to the blue algae problem .
so my goal was to overcome the disadvantages of these current treatment methods and create a safe , sustainable , cost-effective and eco-friendly method of purifying water .
and then they would remember the first part of last century , which was really bad , and we could go by this so-called great leap forward .
so i &apos;m here to tell you a story of success from africa .
we could get them .
so the metaphor i &apos;d like the use i can take from a story of a great idea that &apos;s quite recent — a lot more recent than the 1650s .
it was also people &apos;s deep longing for freedom .
i &apos;m going to begin by reciting a poem .
but he was also in oxford in the &apos; 50s , and yet growing up as a child in nigeria , my father used to say to me , &quot; &quot; you must never eat or drink in a yoruba person &apos;s house because they will poison you . &quot; &quot; it makes sense now when i think about it , because if you &apos;d known my father , you would &apos;ve wanted to poison him too .
we wanted to do something now .
we also heard that 250 billion indian rupees was dedicated for government schooling .
i didn &apos;t expect that person that i was going to meet to be him .
js : god knows .
this raises the very real possibility of anonymous war .
the best chess players spend a lot of time not playing games of chess , which would be their performance zone , but trying to predict the moves grand masters made and analyzing them .
good .
but you can see how your people are communicating with each other , what times they call each other , when they go to bed .
extruded typography that &apos;s backlit with neon .
at verdun , in 1916 , over a 300-day period , 700,000 people were killed , so about 2,000 a day .
but lizzie wolf has shown that when we frame our strong emotions as passion , the condemnation of our crying disappears for both men and women .
and i &apos;m also being told that the drum is without snares .
( music ) &#91; basque &#93; ( music ) thank you .
this is a simulation that uses graphics , but other people find motivating what money can buy , not just numbers .
how many children did you have ?
does evolution control the sophistication of matter in the universe ?
i &apos;m in something big , bad and ugly .
and while the hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological dark matter are really only in their infancy , there &apos;s a very , very exciting possibility that exists : that buried in this life , in this genetic information , are signatures of as of yet unidentified life .
but why ?
this solution was initially designed for the chinese market , but now it &apos;s selling like hotcakes in the u.s. and europe , where hospitals are pressured to deliver quality care at lower cost .
now , finning is the act of taking a shark , cutting the valuable fins off and throwing the live animal back in the water .
and then the secretary-general of the united nations came up to speak to god and said , &quot; when will our international institutions work ? &quot;
we don &apos;t want to have what there is in the west .
my dad was a high-ranking gang member who ran the streets .
when i listened to all the stories everywhere i went on the continents , i couldn &apos;t always understand the complicated circumstances of their conflict .
in fact , i think that most of it has to do with body size — the size you are when you inherit a vacant ecospace from whatever natural disaster .
so the adoption papers were signed .
there are the lunch ladies in kentucky who realized that 67 percent of their students relied on those meals every day , and they were going without food over the summer , so they retrofitted a school bus to create a mobile feeding unit , and they traveled around the neighborhoods feedings 500 kids a day during the summer .
now , creative works may indeed be kind of like property , but it &apos;s property that we &apos;re all building on , and creations can only take root and grow once that ground has been prepared .
but if you think about it , if you have a lily pad and it just divided every single day — two , four , eight , 16 — in 15 days you have 32,000 .
and so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in , we can do that .
and if we want to cure ourselves of ndd , or nature deficit disorder , i think this is a great way of doing it .
basically , we tribalize , and that process of unifying feels so good and is so good for us , that it even helps people who are struggling with mental health issues .
i was so lucky to watch the change of that south africa into the new south africa as i went year by year .
that is a &quot; &quot; who is who &quot; &quot; list .
but i think i get to come back to this , because imagine having a compact reactor in a rocket that produces 50 to 100 megawatts .
i was more concerned with touching the screen on my apple than actually feeding him one .
and an ipad .
actually , i read this great quote the other day , which was , &quot; style makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you &apos;re going to die . &quot;
you see , indian music , for example , does not have the concept of harmony .
and that montana is a beautiful place to visit but you do not want to live there , because it is the number one state for suicidal ideation .
so how many other madoffs are there on wall street or in the city of london , fleecing ordinary folk and money laundering ?

we &apos;ve seen a coercion strategy in which sexual structures are used in a forceful way to basically make a female have sex .
we need to elongate the time frame upon which we judge the balance in our life , but we need to elongate it without falling into the trap of the &quot; &quot; i &apos;ll have a life when i retire , when my kids have left home , when my wife has divorced me , my health is failing , i &apos;ve got no mates or interests left . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) a day is too short ; &quot; &quot; after i retire &quot; &quot; is too long .
enough excuses .
so we just switch off : us , governments and aid agencies .
i &apos;m going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this that we demonstrated in washington . can we look at this thing ?
you may have noticed in the baseball and pizza comparison , under the baseball , it &apos;s all commands .
the computers back up each other . there &apos;s a voting system — if one computer is not agreeing with the other three , it &apos;s kicked out of the system .

so try to tell me which child is lying and which child is telling the truth .

they &apos;re also , number three , the most efficient repairers of fractures that we &apos;ve ever encountered .
our school systems are very flawed and do not reward you for the things that are important in life or for the survival of civilization ; they reward you for a lot of learning and sopping up stuff .
now , many of you have heard the phrase the &quot; &quot; double bind &quot; &quot; and connected it with one thing , and that &apos;s gender .
redwoods grow very slowly in their tops .
so to compensate , i &apos;d hold the pen tighter , and this progressively made the shake worse , so i &apos;d hold the pen tighter still .
but i &apos;m just saying , if y &apos;all are interested in the top five songs , you need to holler at me .
so , birds chirping outside your window may indicate normality , perhaps because , as a species , we &apos;ve been used to that sound every morning for millions of years .
the pilot , i knew , was called troy . i was expecting someone called troy that did this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy .

all peoples are simply cultural options , different visions of life itself .
sometimes , we ask ourselves if we can save the vets .

most people think it &apos;s land mines , but it &apos;s a vehicle accident .
around the world today we &apos;re seeing an incredible transformation , from what i would call a biocidal species , one that — whether we intentionally or unintentionally — have designed our systems to kill life , a lot of the time .
but what we do know is that it isn &apos;t 10 years or 10 billion dollars or a large humanoid robot away .
this last project is also of components .
( clang ) ( laughs ) now obviously , as maddie &apos;s chemistry teacher , i love that she went home and continued to geek out about this kind of ridiculous demonstration that we did in class .
that &apos;s wrong because the theory is quantum mechanical .
and we build buildings of different sizes and styles and different materials , depending on where we are .
( laughter ) before there was data , this was the decision-making device to use . ( laughter )
now raise your hand if any of this is sounding familiar to you , from your part of the world .
it stands guard at the boundary between the known and the unknown , because in order to discover something truly new , at least one of your basic assumptions has to change , and that means that in science , we do something quite heroic .
the woman i thought i was would have said yes .
thank you . thank you . ( applause )
a lot of sexuality education that happens today is so influenced by the baseball model , and it sets up education that can &apos;t help but produce unhealthy sexuality in young people .

my vote won &apos;t count .
when we are in medical school , we learn our anatomy from illustrations such as this where everything &apos;s color-coded .
so as a child , my parents used to drag me to these family events .
and one month ago we have unveiled it .
it &apos;s done by geologists , engineers , biologists , all sorts of different people — modeling and simulation .
that means the host probably stopped listening two minutes ago because he thought of this really clever question , and he was just bound and determined to say that .
we found this leopard in a 2,000-year-old baobab tree in africa , the same tree that we found her mother in and her grandmother .
and this is because one of the things we &apos;ve learned over the last decade of studying market development in africa is that the piecemeal approach does not work .
i &apos;ll just tell you quickly about two stories drawn from recent headlines .
it could be that on one day , the colony is split between two boxes , but on another day , it could be together in a single box , or split between three or more boxes , and that all seems rather erratic , really .
ok now , more importantly , had we been there in the &apos; 40s and &apos; 50s , &apos; 60s , had we seen this disease , had we understood exactly what was going on with it , how might that have changed and completely transformed the nature of the way this pandemic moved ?
and so we met dr. sono khangharani in pakistan .
and the marketing is that not matter how much you &apos;ve invested in your brand , one bad week can undermine decades of good work .
of course , what would we be without computers ?
yeah , it &apos;s very different — no , it &apos;s not different .
now it &apos;s important to understand that this room is cooled by water , heated by water , filters its own water , and it &apos;s powered by water .
hi , elizabeth , i loved your talk .
he came up with a 200-year-old idea called moiré patterns .
start with 10,000 empty boxes and an org chart covering down to every minor city .
she is now an integral member of our family , having been with us since alia was six months old .
( laughter ) and my idea is this — all these men and women should be free to decide whether they do or do not want to conceive a child .
this is allowing them to find the bonding nodes in any lattice of atoms .
hello .
( laughter ) now again , we kind of caved in , and we did the very practical approach , which was a bit less awesome .
it said things like , &quot; &quot; in many important ways we are causing real harm to the places we live in , &quot; &quot; and , &quot; &quot; it is essential that we take steps now to prevent further destruction from being done to our earth . &quot; &quot; another group of participants were assigned to read a really different essay that was designed to tap into the conservative value of moral purity .
we were one of the lucky ones to get in the class with the sony cameras and the vista software .
and it takes them about a million years to settle out .
so what we &apos;ve done here is , more or less , a reverse turing test .
a generous mistress whom many loved much .
and as these tectonic plates are spreading apart , magma , lava is coming up and filling those gaps , and you &apos;re looking land — new land — being created right before your eyes .
doing nothing at work is akin to masturbating at work ; it &apos;s totally inappropriate .
and we have a little video that describes the sequence .
there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much .
it was that little outliers there . you see that guy that lived a long time ?
music was once a very physical thing .
okay . ( laughs ) right .
seven years ago , an even faster and cheaper american manufacturing technology was used to make this little carbon fiber test part , which doubles as a carbon cap .
and there is as many different kinds of pollen as there are flowering plants .
that &apos;s the idea , and we &apos;re setting this up in the bay area .
and i think that &apos;s symbolic of what we &apos;re seeing in the world in general , that the world is becoming smaller and smaller , and that all of the peoples in the world are enjoying more opportunities for connection .
he &apos;s another young designer from france who &apos;s working — and at this point he &apos;s working , also , with pharmaceutical companies — on new ways to engage patients , especially children , in taking their medicines with constancy and with certainty .
our group , palliative care , in 2012 , working with the sickest of the sick — cancer , heart disease , lung disease , renal disease , dementia — how did we improve patient experience ?
so this is a picture of birds generated entirely by a neural network that was trained to recognize birds , just by solving for x rather than solving for y , and doing that iteratively .
for a data scientist that just happened to go to space camp as a kid , it just doesn &apos;t get much better than that .
now , the great news about all this , and we have a ton of work left to do , and we have a lot of culture to change , but the great news about all of it is that we know it works .
i don &apos;t there &apos;s anyone in this room who &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; well , the right way to start would be , let &apos;s make a great seat belt for adults .

for me , air is plural .
( music ) ( applause ) talking about geometry and everything , if you take the circle and you split it in half — can you run &quot; &quot; s-curve music ? &quot; &quot; i &apos;m going to do just a short version of it .
so i think we need a deeper understanding of how people , money , power , religion , culture , technology interact to change the map of the world .
but it &apos;s a question of how tortuous this path is from those frail beginnings , those seeds , all the way to life .
so our legislators cannot analyze the budget that they are voting for .
i mentioned that to miguel , and he nodded .
we can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything .
after that experience , i changed .

it &apos;s a bee that , yes , flies .

a network is not just the product of its component parts .
it means that the economy is dividing into high-skill , high-wage jobs and low-skill , low-wage jobs — and that the middle , the middle-skill jobs , and the middle-earning jobs , are starting to drop out of the economy .
these are volcanic stones laid by hand .
now there is much to gain and benefit from this massive analysis of personal information , or big data , but there are also complex tradeoffs that come from giving away our privacy .
the more people who know about this technology , the more we can all have a voice in how it &apos;s being used .

this is a graph of autism prevalence estimates rising over time .
and the idea was the relationship of the space , which was made up of the fold of the image , and the dialectic or the conflict between the figuration , and the clarity of the image and the complexity of the space , which were in dialog .

we can insist that all people have the opportunity to learn about contraceptives and have access to the full variety of methods .
and he got me a super 8 camera when i was 10 years old .
months later , maybe about two months later , i started about getting my job back , which is something , when you become this primary caregiver person , which some people in the audience here have certainly been in that position , it &apos;s a challenging role but at some point you &apos;ve got to figure out when you &apos;re going to get your life back , and at the time , i couldn &apos;t ask gabby if she wanted me to go fly in the space shuttle again .
this shift is the most striking in the u.s. and in the u.k. , but it &apos;s a global phenomenon .
obviously it was shown , and it was amazing .
this is a campaign done by a young artist in new york , who calls himself &quot; &quot; true . &quot; &quot; everybody who has ridden the new york subway system will be familiar with these signs ?
but we &apos;d also see something very , very surprising .
i might not be your typical person you find on this stage .
i set it up with the foreman . i set it up with the owner of the land .
so our first critical moment , it &apos;s open .
major moves , outside of our equatorial homeland , from africa into other parts of the old world , and most recently , into the new world .
you can just change a couple of the dna strands in this binary representation and you &apos;ll get 96 rather than 32 .

and many , many people wanted to join us , because you don &apos;t go into this kind of work to manage a system , you go in because you can and you want to make a difference .
i broke it into a top tier and a second tier of points , and i ranked everything starting at 100 and going all the way down to 91 , and listing things like i was looking for somebody who was really smart , who would challenge and stimulate me , and balancing that with a second tier and a second set of points .
and then literally , you now pour on a monomer .
i said , &quot; &quot; how much is it worth ? &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; we will start with smaller quantity , &quot; &quot; — i was like , aww — and then he said , &quot; &quot; of 25 kgs . ( laughter )

here we go .
in fact , we &apos;re separated by 95 million years of divergent evolution .
it turns out it &apos;s not rocket science to design a sacred space .
but if we want to look at the sky and see predictions , we still can .
so here &apos;s a general rule of thumb that i believe in : when societies have strong institutions , the difference that one good leader can make is limited , but when you have weak institutions , then just one good leader can make or break that country .

we can &apos;t settle for that , which is why the concern about the eighth goal , which relates to funding , which i said at the beginning is falling , is so troubling .
it &apos;s also carried on migration patterns of wild migratory aquatic birds .
because i think it &apos;s an urgent question .
and that &apos;s the way it is with definitions of words .
and i would imagine that a lot of you have too .
they give me , i don &apos;t know , a sense of correctness in the world and some visual delight in the knowledge that the building will probably never look as good as this simple industrial scaffolding that is there to serve .
and the last one is destructive attacks , and those are the ones that concern me the most .
simply put , when the impulse is to change the world , the academy is more likely to engender a learned helplessness than to create a sense of empowerment .
just complete domination .
but that was my first real experience as a solo singer-songwriter .
you may have worried that you ate carbs after 7pm last night , and that you really should renew your gym membership .
so i was trained as a historian .
it &apos;s two people dropping the pretense of being know-it-alls .
the first , to my mind , is what i call as &quot; &quot; the ideas that have arrived . &quot; &quot; these ideas have brought together something which has made india happen the way it is today .
but what i &apos;ve come to learn is that the world is never saved in grand messianic gestures , but in the simple accumulation of gentle , soft , almost invisible acts of compassion , everyday acts of compassion .
so we met in november 2002 , and aicha will now tell you how that came about .
for all the names i &apos;ll never know , say her name .
when we say of somebody that he &apos;s &quot; &quot; in it for the money , &quot; &quot; we are not just being descriptive .
the other thing that &apos;s also interesting that &apos;s going on here is the fact that intelligence agencies — and it doesn &apos;t matter who they are — they all operate in an industry where their commodity is information , or restricted access to information .
so jains are not supposed to eat meat .
that &apos;s the principle objective .
we &apos;re down to one and half right now .
the wall that kept me , elyn , professor saks , separate from that insane woman hospitalized years past , lay smashed and in ruins . &quot; &quot; everything about this illness says i shouldn &apos;t be here , but i am . and i am , i think , for three reasons : first , i &apos;ve had excellent treatment .
fg : because i want to get a standing ovation like everybody , so ...
because if you double one percent seven more times , which is exactly what happened , you get 100 percent . and the project was finished on time .
it tells a story . the story can reach into obscure desires .
we were going to exist . here &apos;s another one .
crispr is going to be amazing , in terms of the number of different scientific advances that it &apos;s going to catalyze .
this was reinforced by the political climate of the time .
i &apos;m going to think about it in 3d space . so now , instead of it just being a letter that &apos;s in front of me , it &apos;s a space that my body can go inside of .
so in a yin-yang way , silence needs loudness and loudness needs silence for either of them to have any effect .
we symmetrize the face , and we run our algorithm .
but i was committed to making sure that i could do anything possible to make her stay more comfortable . i brought her a warm blanket and a cup of a coffee .
so hopefully tomorrow i ’ ll show one or two more objects from the stage , but for today i just wanted to say thank you for all the people that came and talked to us about it .
and this person is particularly interesting .
in contrast , in traditional societies without writing , older people are the repositories of information .
the u.s. news &amp; world report ranks colleges just as the consumer report rates washing machines .
i don &apos;t know how to prevent that , but i &apos;m at least going to use my good offices to get you folks together to come up with a response . &quot; &quot; so they formed a white house task force , and they spent about three years arguing about who takes how much responsibility in the global supply chain .
first of all , you have to edit ruthlessly .
so if you look at this , you might immediately grasp that different people have different numbers of connections .
( applause ) we &apos;re delighted about it as well .
and that &apos;ll make such a huge difference on the system , because the amount of waiting time and the amount of distances that people need to travel , often sometimes seven to 15 kilometers , sometimes by foot , to get a simple health check done , is very , very detrimental in the sense that it really dissuades people from getting access to health care .
but mucus is actually very important .
and then we had some hint that these things existed all along the axis of it , because if you &apos;ve got volcanism , water &apos;s going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor , come in contact with magma , and come shooting out hot .
this year &apos;s swine flu strain grew very poorly in early production : basically .6 doses per egg .
i need a hundred billion . &quot; &quot; so i &apos;m like that .
we won &apos;t bring anything with us .
how does life make things ?
so what do you think happens to these gals ?
it has led me to further my research and to use it as a model for my laboratory research .
( applause ) thank you very much . ( applause )
we need to learn from those figures that i mentioned .
i talk about race and this question of whether we deserve to kill .
well , there are steps we can take to navigate our way through the morass .
those combinations yield very much more than the sum of the parts , especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities .
for a two-year-old , that is like a tattoo . ( laughter ) you know ? you only get one birthday per year .
as the sign said back there , &quot; &quot; without limitations . &quot; &quot; they knew no other way to live than to follow their dreams .
in this case , supply right next to demand .
( applause )
( chomping ) ( drum roll ) ( toilet flushing ) okay . next to the pitch region is another set of regions that are selectively responsive when you hear the sounds of speech .
( laughter ) but sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that .
that chin barbel is flashing .
he had three or four friends with him , and he does that , and they all look , and there was no infection , and they bend over me and they &apos;re poking and prodding , and they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; there &apos;s no hematomas , blah blah , look at the color , &quot; &quot; and they &apos;re talking amongst themselves and i &apos;m , like , this restored automobile that he &apos;s just going , &quot; &quot; yeah , i did that . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and it was just , it was amazing , because these guys are high-fiving him over how good i turned out , you know ? ( laughter ) and it &apos;s my zipper , and i &apos;ve still got the staples in and everything . and
how is that possible ? let &apos;s go to something else .
simplicity is a neat word . and you &apos;ve got to think about what simplicity means .
this does not mean that it &apos;s the final solution , or that this even provides permanent protection .
no , it matters quite a bit , and i &apos;ll give you an example of why .
here you see actually how the damage appears in this material .
( applause )
a terrific use of local materials , but inside you could find some interior compositions .
i started improv everywhere about 10 years ago when i moved to new york city with an interest in acting and comedy .
and this idea , again , came from the grassroots , from two googlers who wrote their own job descriptions and volunteered themselves for the job .
and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i &apos;ve been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me .
my accent with english improved a lot .
behind the destruction , i found a soul of places .
the goal of spacex is to try to advance rocket technology , and in particular to try to crack a problem that i think is vital for humanity to become a space-faring civilization , which is to have a rapidly and fully reusable rocket .
it &apos;s very , very , very detailed inside with the design .
there &apos;s a growing extremism that comes from both sides in this debate , in response to this conflict between the law and the use of these technologies .
there are some creatures on this planet already that don &apos;t really do aging .
but this time , the migration leaves african-americans in place , as families and businesses flee the city , leaving the city pretty desolate of people as well as jobs .
disease .
now xu and i , on the other hand , were in a completely windowless black room not making any ocular movement that even remotely resembles an eye blink because our eyes were fixed onto a computer screen .
( laughter ) lg : yeah , armani . ok .
it &apos;s actually not limited to films .
so we said , there &apos;s just got to be a better way to do this .
now , if violence is re-concentrating geographically , it &apos;s also being reconfigured to the world &apos;s new topography , because when it comes to cities , the world ain &apos;t flat , like thomas friedman likes to say .
but i don &apos;t want you in the frame , i don &apos;t want you in the window , i want you through the window , i want you on the other side , in the world , inhabiting the world .
the bigger the crowd , the more potential innovators there are .
we can never go back to a place and find it exactly where we left it .
one of the reasons , i think , is a sort of boiled frog phenomenon .
now , let &apos;s put aside the online anonymous sex chatrooms , which i &apos;m sure none of you have been in .
and before long , in some months , raisuddin was that olive garden &apos;s highest grossing alcohol pusher .
let &apos;s look at a country like india .
so this story is the first of 18 chapters in my new body of work titled &quot; &quot; a living man declared dead and other chapters . &quot; &quot; and for this work , i traveled around the world over a four-year period researching and recording bloodlines and their related stories .
i &apos;ll follow her advice . i &apos;ll stop talking .
i photograph from a fixed vantage point , and i never move .
there &apos;s several examples up on the screen of situations where doctors are looking to implant devices inside of people , and all of these devices now , it &apos;s standard that they communicate wirelessly , and i think this is great , but without a full understanding of trustworthy computing , and without understanding what attackers can do and the security risks from the beginning , there &apos;s a lot of danger in this .
once you start down at this very humble level , then you can start finding ways to see things .
and that is a room that was built for a woman named nancy wilson , who recorded that album at our school last christmas .
and the way to ask that question is to look at the neanderthal that comes from southern europe and compare it to genomes of people who live today .
molas are infamous for carrying tons of parasites .
i mean , we &apos;re not putting this one back .
i went down there in the winter time .
the second thing you need is light .
no , it doesn &apos;t mean that at all .
anybody do any writing today ? did anybody write a word ?
so that when we begin to grapple with the ideas of artificial intelligence in the future , we shouldn &apos;t only be asking ourselves , &quot; can we build it ? &quot;
but there is a problem with that view .
it went up to 49 .
naela ayyash , who strived to build a self-sufficient palestinian economy by encouraging women in gaza to grow vegetables in their backyards , an activity deemed illegal by the israeli authorities at that time ; rabeha diab , who took over decision-making authority for the entire uprising when the men who had been running it were deported ; fatima al jaafari , who swallowed leaflets containing the uprising &apos;s directives in order to spread them across the territories without getting caught ; and zahira kamal , who ensured the longevity of the uprising by leading an organization that went from 25 women to 3,000 in a single year .
well it turns out that the computer analogy is just as valid for emotion .
the right of peoples to live together in the same state , worshiping differently , freely — a middle east , a world , in which religion is not the subject of division or of debate .
but i had no idea what the context was or what that even , what it even meant to the people who heard it .
1998 : a single mother of four , three months after the birth of my fourth child , i went to do a job as a research assistant .
combining the live play and the serialization of written fiction , you get this new format .
they &apos;re going at a meter a second . how many think the one on the left is running up the wall ?
we have complete control over his blush responses , the diameter of his nostrils to denote stress .
em : it must , actually . if it doesn &apos;t , we &apos;re in deep trouble .
&quot; i feel very lonely . &quot;
this is the view looking down the hudson river , with manhattan on the left , and new jersey out on the right , looking out toward the atlantic ocean .
( audience : five of clubs . ) lg : pardon ? ( audience : five of clubs . ) lg : five of clubs . it &apos;s not the same person , even if it &apos;s the same spot .
because the real peak is hidden around the corner .
the six-year-old is in a car seat , and it turns out that looks terrible , but that &apos;s great . that &apos;s like a 400 , ok ?
&quot; &quot; to say that something is essential is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the achievement of a certain object .
so i like to invent things too , and i think i &apos;ll close out my set with something i invented a good while back .
so one of the big bellwethers , and one of my final points i want to mention , is the interesting thing i read is that cnbc has launched their first african channel . why is cnbc doing this ?
we get one child like that about every classroom of 30 kids who will actually cut straight to the chase .
but we are indeed heading for a major crisis , and i ’ d like people to become aware of this problem .
everyone on the team knew that i have a wife and two small children — 10 and 15 — and i wanted to come back safely .
and the whole series of work came out of it .
very quickly , i felt like i didn &apos;t belong .
what we rarely do is ask refugees what they want , where they want to go , but i &apos;d argue we can do that and still make everyone better off .
the second is that traditional charity and aid are never going to solve the problems of poverty .
and he had a very large head , which she thought might indicate hydrocephalus .
we extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy is up here .
he &apos;s a man , a servant , an older servant looking at this younger servant , saying , &quot; &quot; look at me . i want to warn you about what you &apos;re about to go through . please look at me . &quot; &quot; and he never does .
and so this allows for a controlled delivery of drugs and for reintegration in the environment in all of these formats that you &apos;ve seen .
now , there &apos;s good news and bad news about this corruption .
so for this reason , i think one of the other themes with the mesh is essentially that , if we squeeze hard on things that we &apos;ve thrown away , there &apos;s a lot of value in those things .
and if you look through the eye , or you look at the vessels on the white of the eye , in fact , you may be able to do this directly , without drawing any blood at all , or through your nail beds .
and so , what we found out was that , if you take animals that are animated like you and i , and you make them cold — that is , these were the garden worms — now they &apos;re dead .
they say , &quot; &quot; how dare you take this child out of the house and terrify other people .
it &apos;s a complete denial of mistakes .
basically , a human body is a conversation going on , both within the cells and between the cells , and they &apos;re telling each other to grow and to die , and when you &apos;re sick , something &apos;s gone wrong with that conversation .
because i think it &apos;s not just a cultural space or housing ; there has to be the recreation of an economic core .
here are some fun images . here &apos;s burt rutan and my good friend greg meronek inside a zero gravity — people think a zero gravity room , there &apos;s a switch on there that turns it off — but it &apos;s actually parabolic flight of an airplane .
( applause ) danit peleg : rebecca is wearing one of my five outfits .
and you just never know who is going to take something from that and turn it into something else , because inspiration is cross-pollinating .
these girls are also working in big construction companies like ram-ki construction , as masons , full-time masons .
the whole cementation process takes about 24 hours .
i got the chinese line .
zk : it &apos;s steve . all right steve , now , follow me .
mom was a nurse &apos;s aid .
the hyena is the ancestor of the horse because it was part of a production called &quot; &quot; faustus in africa , &quot; &quot; a handspring production from 1995 , where it had to play draughts with helen of troy .
( laughter ) people have used it to magnify pulsing veins in their hands .
( applause )
but , if we put money into the core budget , we know that there aren &apos;t the budget systems with integrity that mean that money will be well spent .
our borrowing costs were skyrocketing , and we were facing possible default .
and the red cross too is training volunteers and twitter is certifying them , not simply to supplement existing government institutions , but in many cases , to replace them .
and he &apos;ll do that hundreds and hundreds of times .
it &apos;s not about selling soap , it &apos;s about making sure that in the process of doing so you can change people &apos;s lives .
she was actually coming out of an amnesty international meeting . ( laughter )
mri is using magnetic fields and radio frequencies to scan the brain , or any part of the body .
and he also told me about young japanese-americans during the second world war .
you know , we can make ozone from car tailpipes .
but if there &apos;s a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there , and you make them small enough , and we won &apos;t see them either . that is true .
in fact , you can &apos;t even take the name of the country for granted , because the name &quot; &quot; india &quot; &quot; comes from the river indus , which flows in pakistan .
but i do have to be concerned with those things .
( digital hum and whistling sound ) the ( whistles ) is frogs at home , don &apos;t pay attention to that .
in tuscaloosa , at the university of alabama , there &apos;s an organization on campus called , kind of menacingly , the machine , and it draws from largely white sororities and fraternities on campus , and for decades , the machine has dominated student government elections .
what do you think that fan &apos;s experience is going to be when we take the video footage of an adrian peterson bursting through the line , shedding a tackler with a stiff-arm before sprinting in for a touchdown ? what do you think that fan &apos;s experience
and don &apos;t console yourself that you are the 99 percent .
and the supreme court justices wrestled with that question .
as leah , one of the founders of the group , says , &quot; &quot; i like traditional music very much .
and i said , &quot; &quot; you know what ? these apples come from your ancestors , and your ancestors gave them the greatest honor they could give them .
and that gets you all the scientific data that goes with it .
and dysphoria refers to a feeling of agitation or unease .
they want a say in decisions that are made in their name and with their money . it &apos;s this democratization of information that i think is an information enlightenment , and it has many of the same principles of the first enlightenment .
twelve years ago , i was a fresh graduate seeking my way in the world .
there are very few young infants because they die — high mortality rate — and there &apos;s very few old people .
over 20,000 economists whose job it is , competitive entry to get there , couldn &apos;t see what was happening .
i want to do that too — &quot; &quot; oh ! oh ! &quot; &quot; and all of that .
if in the islamic revolution , the images of the woman portrayed were submissive and didn &apos;t have a voice , now we saw a new idea of feminism in the streets of tehran — women who were educated , forward thinking , non-traditional , sexually open , fearless and seriously feminist .
cp : i stuck that thread so it lasted a few days .
so we &apos;ll release the findings this september for the first time , and then next year , we &apos;ll poll again , and we &apos;ll take the additive step this time of ranking the 1,000 largest u.s. companies from number one to number 1,000 and everything in between .
child : there is no difference here between classes , nor white or black , nor if you have money or not .
( laughter ) and then there are others that are about people .
he said , ok , we &apos;re going to start having these meetings .
but in order to sustain the horizontal line — because these are the projects , these are the systems that we will deliver — we need to also develop the vertical line : system sustenance , high-level education , research and development , industries , technologies , to produce these technologies for application , and finally markets .
and we can &apos;t keep cutting down rain forests for it .
in the process of becoming a supernova , the interior of the star collapses under its own weight and it starts rotating ever faster , like an ice skater when pulling their arms in close to their body .
( applause ) thank you .
but also here is another idea we have — is an intercollegiate exchange program where you have students going from new york abroad .
the stasi also shadowed tens of thousands of people using specially trained agents and secret cameras to document every step one took .
hala simply could no longer cope .
now , it &apos;s not that chemicals are not important in psychiatric disorders .
and i hope you all take part .
and addressing these non-obvious core issues became a key part of the program .
right here , in my city of rio , in spite of mandatory voting , almost 30 percent of the voting population chose to either annul their votes or stay home and pay a fine in the last mayoral elections .
or do i smell some doubt in the room ?
number two , there &apos;s power in promiscuous thinking .
i think they are a cancer of the soul .
it &apos;s a lobster made of playdough that &apos;s afraid of the dark .
we &apos;re seeing them in the beaufort sea , floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out .
and this omission , he said , led to seeing people , and people starting to see themselves , within the categories of the bureaucracies and the institutions .
other outcomes include long-term stalking , even after the abuser remarries ; denial of financial resources ; and manipulation of the family court system to terrify the victim and her children , who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend unsupervised time with the man who beat their mother .
is being more sustainble what gives you a higher quality of life ?
♫ to keep on giving ♫ ♫ and forgiving ♫ ♫ aung san suu kyi ♫ ♫ living under house arrest ♫ ♫ for her peaceful protest ♫ ♫ under house arrest ♫ ♫ for her peaceful protest ♫ ♫ when her people asked her for a message ♫ ♫ she said ♫ ♫ if you &apos;re feeling helpless ♫ ♫ help someone ♫ ♫ if you &apos;re feeling helpless ♫ ♫ help someone ♫ ♫ if you &apos;re feeling helpless ♫ ♫ help someone ♫ ♫ if you &apos;re feeling helpless ♫ ♫ help someone ♫ now we know the words , let &apos;s sing . ♫ if you &apos;re feeling helpless ♫ ♫ help someone ♫ ♫ if you &apos;re feeling helpless ♫ ♫ help someone ♫ ♫ if you &apos;re feeling helpless ♫ ♫ help someone ♫ ♫ if you &apos;re feeling helpless ♫ ♫ help someone ♫
so as is the case with simple solutions , oftentimes the answer is right in front of your face , and for us it was levers .
but go on a bit further up the curve , and then we see it flattening out .
you need proteins for muscles , recovery .
the plant also gets smaller .
how many digits are there in your number ?
by doing these kinds of simulations , we want to eradicate or control malaria thousands of times in software before we actually have to do it in real life ; to be able to simulate both the economic trade-offs — how many bed nets versus how much spraying ? — or the social trade-offs — what happens if unrest breaks out ?
by the 1950s , we started connecting all the towns together with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world , the highway system .
because people used to sew and they needed a pin cushion .
i &apos;m not going to talk about that tonight .
so in fact , something we realized , we can &apos;t just use the web , we have to worry about what the underlying infrastructure of the whole thing , is it in fact of a quality that we need ?
so the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires and then your team wins .
and they further learn this through the lack of teachers that look like them .
and the gm kid is swinging higher , they look better , they &apos;re a better student , they don &apos;t have that stuffy nose you need to wipe .
( applause )
so if , in fact , you want to live a life free of regret , there is an option open to you .
i wrote my book , &quot; &quot; our final century , &quot; &quot; as a scientist , just a general scientist . but there &apos;s one respect , i think , in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective , and that &apos;s that it offers an awareness of the immense future .
imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole .
at that age , obviously , i couldn &apos;t express it that way , but i told her i didn &apos;t feel right .
given that it was such a vast civilization , you might expect to find really powerful rulers , kings , and huge monuments glorifying these powerful kings .
take a look at the death rate from breast cancer over time .
so here we have alice in green and bob in red .
this is her cooking teacher .
some of their cases are questionable and some involve threats and violence .
in a way , the static , stone mountain becomes a moving mountain of sand .
so here &apos;s an example of that , also from andrew &apos;s machine learning class .
ec : ... when i was growing up in the &apos; 90s .
some believe that traveling between the two towers will lead you to another dimension — this bridge has been romanticized as such — that the fall from that frees you from all your worries and grief , and the waters below will cleanse your soul .
yeah . i think it &apos;s evolutionary .
but for many years , until the late 1990s , china had an infrastructure disadvantage vis-a-vis india .
i was on academic and disciplinary probation before i hit double digits , and i first felt handcuffs on my wrists when i was 11 years old .
but responses can actually make a huge difference in the poor countries . this is a proposal that has been talked about a lot in europe .
each of them can make changes and they can merge them after the fact even if they didn &apos;t know of each other &apos;s existence beforehand .
eventually , after a period of six months of brutal war and a toll rate of almost 50,000 dead , we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant .
the hum of the engine died .
lc : oh definitely , definitely . i mean , you know , it was interesting , because i spent basically two years hanging out in this city , dongguan , and over that time , you could see immense change in every person &apos;s life : upward , downward , sideways , but generally upward .
and this hasn &apos;t just happened .
it &apos;s just a set of choices that people make .
we need to have black and white and asian and hispanic just to step forward and say , &quot; we are not going to accept that kind of behavior anymore . &quot;
the last piece of the puzzle is understanding how that code controls your battery .
curiosity has also drilled in that red soil and brought up other material .
in winter , exactly the opposite is happening .
he &apos;s trying to determine if where he is on a bit of long now land would appear from down in the valley to be the actual peak of the mountain .
and you are going to have corresponding abnormal neurology .
there were just bad for me .
paradise on earth , again .
hands up if you think poem 2 was written by a human .
and i even loved seeing behind her ; i could see the little teddy bear sitting on the piano behind her in her room .
similarly , when i have an experience that i describe as a lion or a steak , i &apos;m interacting with reality , but that reality is not a lion or a steak .
here &apos;s clive sinclair now launching his color computer .
then i had video projectors that were projecting intermittently onto the spheres .
( laughter ) and you have to say this room hadn &apos;t been tidied up since 1888 .
but our attempts at doing this are crude and blundering compared to the fine-grained specificity of the parasites .
funds for education , for training and for rehabilitation are declining , so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues .
this is a video editing application where all of the controls for manipulating the video are physical .
people bring their own cooker , he attaches a valve and a steam pipe , and now he gives you espresso coffee . ( laughter ) now , this is a real , affordable coffee percolator that works on gas .
there &apos;s a p.r. company called edelman , they do this very interesting survey every year precisely around trust and what people are thinking .
so , zipcar is a company that i founded seven years ago , but it &apos;s an example of something called car sharing .
no sooner was it proposed than reformers in nigeria adopted it , pushed it and published the revenues in the paper .
no one &apos;s really going to bother you . &quot; &quot; so one of the things that i do is i actually look through my server logs very carefully .
you know , in every culture , shamans have been using environments as medicines .
we sit here — you know , think about the ground vehicles , the human scale — what do you see in person ? we need to capture that up close to establish that what it &apos;s like-type experience .
but as i was moving away from the traditional classical repertoire and trying to find new ways of musical expression , i realized that with today &apos;s technological resources , there &apos;s no reason to limit what can be produced at one time from a single string instrument .
your data looks at fatalities . it doesn &apos;t look at serious injury .
and their politics are not entirely unattractive .
most people use chemical fertilizers . but guess what ?
maybe just a little .
now , we cannot achieve perfection , but if we reach for it , then we can achieve excellence .
and i had to overcome my fear of deep water to find this one .
( laughter ) but michael — he puts it off .
he did this in his phd for hundreds of pairs of drugs .
how many people here would say you &apos;re a maker , if you raise your hand ?
whereas the future self wants the present self to save .
i saw a company that had taken seawater and sand , and they were growing a kind of crop that will grow on pure salt water without having to treat it .
when i first heard from ted and chris a few months ago about the possibility of the prize , i was completely floored .
a woman told me , &quot; &quot; when i see a nollywood film , i can relax , i really — i can breathe better . &quot; &quot; there is also another very important thing that i hope will resonate with this audience .
take a skin cell , make it a master pluripotent cell , so you could then make those cells that are relevant to their disease , both to study but potentially to treat .
but this is what helped me see it .
and this brings me to another favorite of mine — i think , because it is just so unusual .
and we can store information that &apos;s film with water and protein .
you have changed the microclimate .
jake barton : so i have to say i did not actually choose those individual samples to make you cry because they all make you cry .
man : some type of extension pole — like what the painters use .
milo : i just really miss my old house , that &apos;s all .
she started crying . she asked me to call her back .
lp : well , i think invention is not enough .
so what if we &apos;re fighting the wrong war , fighting obesity rather than insulin resistance ?
the system is so healthy , it purifies the water .
they got out on the far end , we said , &quot; &quot; fine , don &apos;t worry about it . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s transparent . a certain amount of certainty gives the sense of a non-zero outcome .
( applause ) so amanda , would you please tell us how you lost your arm ?
and as an economist , we can also look at that side of the story .
america still hated the bear and feared it , but all of a sudden , america also wanted to give the bear a great big hug .
incidentally , we see just one octave .
how do we go from the metaphor to something more practical that we can really use every day ?
so what does this personal health system look like , and what new technologies and roles is it going to entail ?
that makes it easier to imagine trading places with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration to that other person .
well now there are potentials of this building to allow the artistic director to actually move into the building without using our architecture .
i care about it deeply .
he thought , &quot; &quot; oh , i can renovate the school .
and i went . i hadn &apos;t bathed in three days .
and this is even more dangerous — well , it &apos;s dangerous again .

if you flush a toilet , your feces will go to the sewage treatment plants , which are sold as assets , not liabilities .
we have reason to be afraid of melting ice caps .
so we will absorb technology as part of us .
( applause )
it surrounds us all the time , just like the air we breathe in this room .
well , giving your voice can change lives .
52 million people die of natural causes each year corresponds , then , to 52 million volumes destroyed .
in my lab in princeton , we bring people to the fmri scanner and we scan their brains while they are either telling or listening to real-life stories .
now , i think it &apos;s fair to say that when people think about state and local economic development , they don &apos;t generally think first about what they &apos;re doing about childcare and early childhood programs .
maybe it &apos;s called ego .
and some of the watches there , attempting to be beautiful and humorous — maybe not attempting , hopefully succeeding .
today we have choices .
so , what do we do ?
here &apos;s the way i like to describe it instead .
i don &apos;t want to advertise them too much ; that &apos;s not the point .
murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling .
for example , you can use the verb &quot; &quot; go &quot; &quot; and the prepositions &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; in a literal , spatial sense .
&quot; &quot; the worlds are the important thing .

meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink .
for all that it is raising hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in the emerging markets , it &apos;s also outsourcing a lot of jobs from the developed western economies .
they recommended that she do some therapy , but after a while she wasn &apos;t feeling better , so the doctors decided to do further tests .
and so i began my quest to find out how i can learn how to weave .
this is a training ground to sort out the regulars from the honors , a reoccurring cycle built to recycle the trash of this system .
the first question is a tortuous path from geology up to rna or something like that — how did that all work ?
this report is our main public report .
this has never been seen before .
the problem is not technology .
this is how i &apos;ve started to think , and this is certainly how i &apos;ve been thinking in the last few months as i &apos;ve been working on the book that will soon be published , as the dangerously , frighteningly over-anticipated follow up to my freakish success .
i started sketching out these plans to make a photo , and i sent it to the wildlife biologist down in okeechobee — this is an endangered bird , so it takes special permission to do .
history was real , cultures were real , but countries were invented .
we have historical records that allow us to know how the ancient greeks dressed , how they lived , how they fought ...
i wasn &apos;t able to portray his story from within , and so i began to search for a new visual language , one which strived to express the ephemeral quality of his spiritual experience .
he &apos;s sitting there .
( laughter ) this is one substitution that i believe all of us , in design management , are guilty of .
so i went into the woods .
how much do i stand to gain from cheating ?
now , it works just like a regular phone .
so you &apos;re going to be able to go like this . ( laughter )
to keep our partners safe , we work to understand the risk of every location and of every shot before it &apos;s happened , building a backup plan if something goes wrong , and making sure we have everything in place before our operations start .
yet as astronomers , we study a wider range of light and we depend on other methods to do that .
there is one project in the california court system right now that so far cost taxpayers two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and i got distracted by it .
and how are we going to understand all this complex information ?
they might say , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve got a bit of nectar . do you want to come and get it ? &quot; &quot; now this is a plant .
it divides the world into abrahamic religions and eastern religion , but that &apos;s not detailed enough .
&quot; i &apos;m thinking about having a child . &quot;
so for 11 years , i conformed .
chris addressed us , the scientists and experts , &quot; &quot; you have to be more pragmatic .
the choice is whether certain facts about humans , or topics , are to be considered taboos , forbidden knowledge , where we shouldn &apos;t go there because no good can come from it , or whether we should explore them honestly .
enter the evidence-based activist , the factivist .
that &apos;s great news . why ?
all of us have to have a commitment to do that .
some extraordinary things about sneakers and data and nike and how they &apos;re all related , possibly , to the future of all online commerce .
it is happening all across the world , in every kind of walk of life , and every kind of career and industry that you can think of .
the zeppelin — this was from a brochure about the zeppelin based , obviously , on the hindenburg .
it &apos;s easy to see leroy getting the check , right ?
and we found that this individual shared a common origin for his dna sequences with neanderthals around 640,000 years ago .
my colleague , debra fischer , founder of the planet hunters project , said that people at the time were saying , &quot; you &apos;re crazy . there &apos;s no way that a computer will miss a signal . &quot;
minutes before the camera was turned on , they approached a palestinian family that was working their land and told them that they have to leave the land , because this land belongs to the jewish settlers .
we &apos;re not playing with each other .
here &apos;s my cousin gwyneth paltrow .
life is not just an anesthetic to make us smile , but to reach out across the abyss of history , to places we have never been , and would have perhaps been , had we not been so lucky .
we don &apos;t have to change the way a single chinese company works if we get cargill to only send sustainable palm oil to china .
and i &apos;d like to begin with a brief bit of history about what we know about brains .
you can imagine the amount of time that it took me to do this to the house and the displeasure of my parents .
the first and possibly the most important thing we can do is very simple : count the number of fruits on every tree .

it seems counter-intuitive to adult learning , but remember , eight-year-olds live in a society where most of the time they are told , don &apos;t do this , you know , don &apos;t touch the whiskey bottle .
it &apos;s as if there &apos;s some schadenfreude there , that we actually take delight in people getting things wrong , so that we can then moan and groan and bitch at them .
so we had the goal , and now we needed to figure out what are the issues , what is broken .
i &apos;ll give you a couple of more examples on irrational decision-making .
( applause )
the one i want to show you — after we get them to make the movies , we have a night where we show the movies to the community .
anybody use my examples ? the sun and the football ?
because the categories tell me how to tell them apart .
so we &apos;ve placed electrodes within this circuit in an area of the brain called the fornix , which is the highway in and out of this memory circuit , with the idea to see if we can turn on this memory circuit , and whether that can , in turn , help these patients with alzheimer &apos;s disease .
what about failure , though ?
now we &apos;re using this chip . and what are we using it for ?
now can you look at that carefully and see if you see the virgin mary ?
when we started our research on stuxnet six months ago , it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was .
their overriding aim for international aid is to strive for a life of dignity for all .
what if we imagined the upper east side with green roofs , and streams winding through the city , and windmills supplying the power we need ?
and then here &apos;s the reconstructed performance now with the timings of the performance .
there is also a big question of ambiguity .
but 4,000 years is not enough to get us back to our last glacial maximum .
and it &apos;s simple risk perception , really .
land masses began to emerge from the surface of the oceans , and another creature thought , &quot; &quot; hey , that looks like a really nice piece of real estate .
you put down your arrowheads and say , &quot; i &apos;d like to trade these arrowheads for finished arrows . i &apos;ll split you 50 / 50 . &quot;
now don &apos;t get me wrong ; i am not against teaching english , all you english teachers out there .
my fear of public speaking , my social anxiety , poof , gone .
it &apos;s doing that based on the content inside the images .
on facebook , on twitter , on google , all sorts of places where millions of people , myself included , were talking about the events and saw images like this , the emotional , poignant image of a baby with &quot; &quot; je suis charlie &quot; &quot; on its wrist .
his slide into criminality was incremental .
we have second- and third-generation fuels that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar , to much higher-value fuels like octane or different types of butanol .
they &apos;re called millennium development goals .
thank you .
how many of you heard that saying that leadership is lonely ?
i did this as an experiment of casting the shadow .
it was a complicated thing , and i &apos;m not pretending it was more simple than it was .
and what i want to show you is that in regenerative medicine , we &apos;ve really shifted away from that idea of taking a bioinert material .
this is a new way to type , on my old , color classic .
we can choose this moment of crisis to ask and answer the big questions of society &apos;s evolution — like , what do we want to be when we grow up , when we move past this bumbling adolescence where we think there are no limits and suffer delusions of immortality ?

the concussion didn &apos;t heal properly , and after 30 days , i was left with symptoms like nonstop headaches , nausea , vertigo , memory loss , mental fog .
because , of course , every technique that you &apos;ve seen here is something that television and film producers have been able to do for the last 50 years .
they were in the lab working , and they saw the work , not as schoolwork , but as their lives .
now where do we go from there ?
and it also supports working-class kids going into indian schools .
there &apos;s an air jet that dries you .
here a community camp just organized by the community themselves , where they find a place , organize volunteers , and then we &apos;ll do our part . you know , check their vision , and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is and then determine what further testing should be done , and then those tests are done by technicians who check for glasses , or check for glaucoma .
it &apos;s as far as you can fly on a regularly scheduled airplane .
what is it that we need to do fundamentally to re-engage in a project , that capital formation is rapid ?
if i were to ask you guys , what do you rely on when you &apos;re looking at somebody and you want to find out if they &apos;re lying ? what cue do you pay attention to ?
we need to spend time now to really protect our right to share this only with people that we want to share this with , because without this , we simply can &apos;t have a free society .
it fine-tunes your brain &apos;s social instincts .
so an exception to this , however , is penalty shootouts .
people say , &quot; &quot; is such and such true ? &quot; &quot; and i &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; hmm , not sure . &quot; &quot; i &apos;ll think about it roughly .
but when nicholas negroponte — and he has spoken about this project a lot , he &apos;s the founder of olpc — came to us about two and a half years ago , there were some clear ideas .
this lifelong capacity for plasticity , for brain change , is powerfully expressed .
maybe justine sacco &apos;s crime was not being as good at it as randy newman .
( laughter ) or a virgin for a sacrifice ?
well , you know , it was beginner french , that i am taking with her , you know .
einstein , can you also sing ?
that day , the first film of a public beheading was created in france .
so , this is a project for nine inch nails .
intolerance , exclusion and revenge became the icons of the &#91; aftermath &#93; of the revolution .
it &apos;s not as sophisticated as the language of the wall street journal .

we had gone hunting for pills but we ended up finding theories .
i saw the structure while i was on the train , and i got off at the next station and met people there that gave me access to their catacomb-like basement , which was used for ammunition storage during the war and also , at some point , to hide groups of jewish refugees .
i went to an online encyclopedia , wikipedia , and i entered the term &quot; &quot; earth . &quot; &quot; you can start anywhere , this time i chose earth .
what kind of a world can we be making ? &quot; &quot; are treated with more and more skepticism , and move off the table .
they &apos;re going to throw some polymer plastic into the bricks , shove them in a microwave oven , and then you will be able to build buildings with really thick walls .
ok ? and you can consider all sorts of different bush meat .
&quot; &quot; um , abed , &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; i thought you had a few driving issues before the crash . &quot;
when you look into it , it &apos;s sort of like looking at cloud patterns , but sometimes they &apos;re very modeled and highly rendered .
he was in dental school , talented , promising ...
we &apos;ll then go to the next paradigm .
well basically that means that this protein is changing from the sensitive cell to the resistant cell .
the grizzly would soon be wiped out from 95 percent of its original territory , and whereas once there had been 30 million bison moving across the plains , and you would have these stories of trains having to stop for four or five hours so that these thick , living rivers of the animals could pour over the tracks , now , by 1902 , there were maybe less than 100 left in the wild .
now the problem is that we &apos;re not thinking about it in very innovative ways .
trash the system or crash the planet — it &apos;s a tough choice ; it isn &apos;t much of a choice .
we took mice and we gave them one p , paroxetine .
it would make a very uplifting world .
that &apos;s an enormous model .
that is because &#91; there &#93; , in georgia , white people and black people are more historically familiar to one another .

i mean , why would anyone think such a crazy thing ?
audience : sex .
i know that i will live with this tragedy , with these multiple tragedies , for the rest of my life .
only unlike the dinosaurs , we can see it coming .

given all of that , mistakes are inevitable .
i think it &apos;s probably 175 billion barrels .
and on top of everything else , bees have their own set of diseases and parasites .

at some point in his wonderful book &quot; the better angels of our nature , &quot; steven pinker says , the old testament says love thy neighbor , and the new testament says love thy enemy , but i don &apos;t love either one of them , not really , but i don &apos;t want to kill them .
he gives them more money for geological data , they come back , they can &apos;t tell him where to go into production .

this is really a change , that you have this lag of more or less 30 , 40 years &apos; difference on the health .
so people that society once considered to be disabled can now become the architects of their own identities and indeed continue to change those identities by designing their bodies from a place of empowerment .
we &apos;ll see two cells in the upper part of the screen attempting to divide .
the computer tells you how to drive — turn left , turn right , speed up , stop .

but if this mclaren were to run into a wall at 65 miles an hour , the entire crash energy would be absorbed by a couple of woven carbon-fiber composite cones , weighing a total of 15 pounds , hidden in the front end .
the character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other .
we need help . we need help .
it &apos;s what is meant by overcoming the horror that we feel when we are under threat of our enemies , and beginning to appreciate the other .
but one of these options is huge , and it has to do with that long-standing question that bothered me as a tiny little kid , about gravity .
i never did anything to anyone that wasn &apos;t .

this is not in what we call the traditional habitable zone , this area around the sun .
this is a big fibroid .
we want to see the whole thing , so let &apos;s inflate it so we can see the whole thing .
what was different this time is the way that the terrorists used modern information communications technologies to locate additional victims and slaughter them .
now when we think of our senses , we don &apos;t usually think of the reasons why they probably evolved , from a biological perspective .
we &apos;re learning more from them than we &apos;re giving them .
you need to always think , what else needs to be discovered ?
we need nothing less than a new green revolution , and the planet boundaries shows that agriculture has to go from a source of greenhouse gases to a sink .
as someone who has spent his entire career trying to be invisible standing in front of an audience is a cross between an out-of-body experience and a deer caught in the headlights , so please forgive me for violating one of the ted commandments by relying on words on paper , and i only hope i &apos;m not struck by lightning bolts before i &apos;m done .
so these black boxes that we live with and take for granted are actually complex things made by other people , and you can understand them .
i have to do a little bit more background reading , but i think this will be the largest amount of force produced by an animal of a given — per body mass . so , really incredible forces .

in hobbesian terms , life is short and brutish there .
but the mayor of london wanted to reintroduce buses with this open platform .
now , when looked at this , it changed the way i see things , because this thing , this network that &apos;s changing across time , it has a memory , it moves , things flow within it , it has a kind of consistency — people can die , but it doesn &apos;t die ; it still persists — and it has a kind of resilience that allows it to persist across time .
mau passed away five months ago , but his legacy and lessons live on .
and there is a front between them , and the front moves .
my green &#91; unclear &#93; 25,000 pounds of vegetables , i &apos;m growing organic citizens , engaged kids .
they play this major role in shaping and maintaining the structure and diversity of the forest , and for that reason , tapirs are known as gardeners of the forest .
because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow , and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye as the one outside the shadow , it would have to be more reflective — just the laws of physics .
and the question is , who do you want to remember — if you had just 45 minutes with your grandmother ?
they last for about five miles , in which case we put our foot back on the pedal .
it was a very big bang .
and i didn &apos;t have one !

perhaps you can hear it in the words i &apos;m speaking even now .
well first of all , it &apos;s because we can read it , which is fantastic .
and in the mean time , personal savings absolutely plummeted .
if you work on two neurons , that &apos;s psychology . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) we have to have more theory , and it can come as much from the top down .
or what if that very same robotic arm could refuel the propellant tank on a spacecraft that relies on chemical propulsion just like you or i would refuel the fuel tanks on our cars ?
that &apos;s their house .
and that usually refers to if a young person , specifically often a young woman , is old enough to have pubic hair , she &apos;s old enough to have sex with .

i watch that tv show &apos; lie to me . &apos; i know you &apos;re lying . &quot; &quot; no , liespotters are armed with scientific knowledge of how to spot deception .
but also , technology has helped to write new pages of our history , or at least to update pages of our histories .

the growing colony of bacteria that you see here is about the width of a human hair .
so the red line is mostly below that curve and indeed there &apos;s only one point that is achieved with the needle that &apos;s protective , and that &apos;s with a high dose of 6,000 nanograms .
so people didn &apos;t even recognize the disease , people who knew ebola .
or a powerless lover , watching with infinite compassion things god is unable to control or change ?
that may not sound like much , but when added up over the whole world , it &apos;s enormous .
magic can be taught . magic can be taught .
i &apos;m saying that the capacity for self-transcendence is just a basic part of being human .
and then this question of uselessness .
this is what your contacts list would look like if i were examining it .
and my brain , thanks to my parents , has been activated to form images in my visual cortex , which we now call the imaging system , from those patterns of information , much as your brain does .
well , the heart stent came from that little blow-up box that you might have learned in elementary school .
you , yeah , yeah . okay , he &apos;s hungry .
but now for the good news !

everything is grist for the mill — except hem lengths .
ask yourself where you learned to assign the meaning of wrong or abnormal to doing many things .
now , out of all the places that do better than the u.s. in reading , how many of them have a formal system for helping teachers improve ?
by now , these thoughtful , opinionated , curious young people thought nothing of tackling films of all forms — black and white , subtitled , documentary , non-narrative , fantasy — and thought nothing of writing detailed reviews that competed to favor one film over another in passionate and increasingly sophisticated prose .
they would not email you back ( laughter ) — but you &apos;d get an automated reply . ( laughter )

( laughter ) the three friends and the stranger , even though the stranger didn &apos;t have any extra information , even though it was just a case of how that changed the conversation to accommodate that awkwardness , the three friends and the stranger , they had a 75 percent chance of finding the right answer .
that &apos;s what &apos;s in fields around the world every single year .
so they &apos;re not a donation .
and so , just the initial lift off from sugarloaf to cross the atlantic , as we were pushing into the jet stream , this enormous balloon — the top of the balloon ended up going at a couple of hundred miles an hour , the capsule that we were in at the bottom was going at maybe two miles an hour , and it just took off .
they are not luxuries .
and hopefully if we understand how we control movement , we can apply that to robotic technology .
what is seen goes in .
( applause )
two of the known applications for this material include interior design and multi-touch systems .
we need to build an arsenal of noncombative weapons in this war on terrorism .
maybe even just calling it that for some of these people would allow them to stop imagining trying to imagine a trauma that didn &apos;t really happen in order to explain a feeling that really is happening .
which is why i say it &apos;s a social justice issue .
thank you .
they vote with these chemical votes , the vote gets counted , and then everybody responds to the vote .
i was pleased to read it . chris went on to say that he &apos;d been influenced by my writings in what he did .

and at the beginning , we were so touched by these stories , we were so amazed by these stories , that we thought that maybe the best way to talk to the guerrillas was to have them talk to themselves , so we recorded about a hundred different stories during the first year , and we put them on the radio and television so that the guerrillas in the jungle could hear stories , their stories , or stories similar to theirs , and when they heard them , they decided to go out .
right ? ( laughter ) doesn &apos;t it sound like something you need to go into hospital ?
it &apos;s one of those things .
sp : but surely antiwar movements depended on mass demonstrations and catchy tunes by folk singers and wrenching photographs of the human costs of war .

mg : so we went to tanzania .
so , what the world needs now is a new type of sign .
think , temes spreading because they must .

and in the years that i &apos;ve been , and we &apos;ve all been campaigning and investigating , i &apos;ve repeatedly seen that what makes corruption on a global , massive scale possible , well it isn &apos;t just greed or the misuse of power or that nebulous phrase &quot; &quot; weak governance . &quot; &quot; i mean , yes , it &apos;s all of those , but corruption , it &apos;s made possible by the actions of global facilitators .
not a single kid that i went to college with has a criminal record right now .
it would allow us to avail ourselves of the use of autonomous vehicles and drones while still preserving our open , civil society .
you remember carlos ?
this is like odysseus when he &apos;s hearing the song .
and he says , the link to one site didn &apos;t just grow on the other page &quot; &quot; like a tree fungus . &quot; &quot; and in fact , i think that &apos;s not entirely true anymore .
and we called it a studio school to go back to the original idea of a studio in the renaissance where work and learning are integrated .
first of all , you &apos;re going to pick up an analog device : a pen .
and i think , as my goals , i always go back to gandhi &apos;s talisman .
it &apos;s interesting because he rejected the aristotelian premise underlying the majority &apos;s opinion .
it became enormous in just a few months .
so this email inspired me to dive into genealogy , which i always thought was a very staid and proper field , but it turns out it &apos;s going through a fascinating revolution , and a controversial one .
and the trick that richard dawkins does , which is to say , to look at them as simply as genes , as vehicles for genes .
and the thing you really hope for is occasionally they burn up , which we won &apos;t see tonight . so .
and the same time , he is sending a mental message to the second rat that didn &apos;t see any light , and the second rat , in 70 percent of the times is going to press the left lever and get a reward without ever experiencing the light in the retina .
one out of every five medicare dollars get spent on alzheimer &apos;s .
thank you very much .
so this is the athena breast health network . it &apos;s a study of 150,000 women in california , and they &apos;re going to return all the data to the participants of the study in a computable form , with one-clickability to load it into the study that i &apos;ve put together . so we &apos;ll know exactly how many people are willing to be unreasonable .
so we have to protect that legacy and be an example .
so was my family , who started looking for me in hospitals , police stations and even morgues .
and this pushes innovation in money out to the edges , where it belongs .
we think there &apos;s a simpler solution to this problem — one that can be used by people who face conditions like this everyday .
and i often look at things as though they &apos;re food .
the fire suits of old , the bulky suits , the thick woolen suits , have been replaced with modern materials like nomex or , more recently , carbonex — fantastic materials that enable us as stunt professionals to burn for longer , look more spectacular , and in pure safety .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
first it starts with the sexual organs , then it starts with cuss words , then it was bush slanders and then people actually got to art .
they &apos;re the reason you have electricity , heat , clean water , food .
it &apos;s coming from the economists imposing their mechanistic thinking on the science .
i sometimes have the idea that nuclear explosions are about to be set off in my brain .
that was a trip .
that would be like getting hungry at night and having to flip through the whole phone book from cover to cover , pausing at every line , just to find the nearest pizza joint .
thank you .
it &apos;s the fact of poor migrant women selling sex specifically that has some feminists uncomfortable .
i want to talk about social innovation and social entrepreneurship .
so that goes along with the chesire cat saying , &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t care much where you want to get to , it doesn &apos;t much matter which way you go . &quot; &quot; but i think it does matter which way we go , and what road we take , because when i think about design in the near future , what i think are the most important issues , what &apos;s really crucial and vital is that we need to revitalize the arts and sciences right now in 2002 .
but on the edge of town , one elderly lady , a charwoman in the charnel ground , saw a jeweled foot on a jeweled lotus on his shoulder and then the dog , but she saw the jewel foot of the maitreya , and she offered a flower .
i need people to understand what the reality in the west bank looks like .
and when we calculated we thought we &apos;re never going to make it around the world at that speed .
you will not play at the casino with the resources that people have entrusted you with .
america today is a sprightly young body , hit by one of those strokes that sucks the life from one side , while leaving the other worryingly perfect .
think about that &apos;s where we are right now , and the curve that we &apos;re on means that this is going to continue to get better .
well linguistic scripts can actually encode multiple languages .
lt : no .
just right , you &apos;re creative , and yet you don &apos;t fall for too much baloney .
we have a dentist — she &apos;s a grandmother , illiterate , who &apos;s a dentist .
the problem is that current prosthetics don &apos;t work very well . they &apos;re still very limited in the vision that they can provide .
and that refers to feeding information into the brain via unusual sensory channels , and the brain just figures out what to do with it .
you can buy cuecas baratas , designer underwear that isn &apos;t really manufactured by a designer , and even pirated evangelical mixtapes . ( laughter ) now , businesses tend to complain about this , and their , they , i don &apos;t want to take away from their entire validity of complaining about it , but i did ask a major sneaker manufacturer earlier this year what they thought about piracy , and they told me , &quot; &quot; well , you can &apos;t quote me on this , because if you quote me on this , i have to kill you , &quot; &quot; but they use piracy as market research .
thank you so much .
so maybe we could activate or inactive memories by just using light — xl : that &apos;s pretty fast .
so i would urge you to really learn about these types of technologies , because , really , only in that way are we going to be able to guide the development of these technologies , the use of these technologies and make sure that , in the end , it &apos;s a positive outcome — for both the planet and for us .
you see , he has established the largest retail chain , called big bazaar .
in the 1970s , the turnover of the red brigades on a yearly basis was seven million dollars .
i remembered an old man yelling to us and crying to help us get him up .
here i have a very complicated , messy , confused idea in my head .
so i was positive that , if somehow we can make things mimic life , let &apos;s go one step further .
we talk about what still has to get done , what &apos;s so critical to get done in the lab .
now , in lebanon , we have one refugee per three lebanese .
they &apos;ll be able to focus their hearing , they &apos;ll be able to increase the sensitivity , decrease the sensitivity , do a series of things that we can &apos;t do .
you may not come near me !
and he died when the ambulance was coming to the hospital to take him .
several people heard about this story , and so they contacted me because they wanted to pay the $ 2,500 debt .
search out the companies that are acting on this .
but in all seriousness , because this idea is birthed in ted , i would like it to be a legacy of ted , and i &apos;d like to call it the &quot; &quot; international system for total early disease detection . &quot; &quot; &#91; instedd &#93; and instedd then becomes our mantra .
this is my last map .
as difficult as it is to see , homo sapiens , that is humans , evolves every day , and still continues to evolve .
and i of course knew stuff , as a designer , about typography , even though we worked with those animals not so successfully .
but for that , we already have the training manuals , which are approved by the ministry and moreover , this approach is now part of the mental health strategy in afghanistan .
for strength and lightness , the dome structure used five rings of coffers , each of diminishing size , which imparts a dramatic forced perspective to the design .
which was three minutes longer than i had prepared .
robotics systems are just incredible these days , absolutely incredible .
and actually , our political beliefs also can affect the way we see other people , including politicians .
violated by this conductor again ?
their involvement reduces the cost .
last year at ted i gave an introduction to the lhc .
people will see my tag , and they &apos;ll see &quot; &quot; the war tapes , &quot; &quot; and then we &apos;ll start talking about war .
what if obesity isn &apos;t the cause of insulin resistance at all ?
this is another subject that comes in place , and this is a prediction .
pm : and when you arrived at the hospital , what was the prognosis that they gave you about gabby &apos;s condition and what recovery , if any , you could expect ?
this pill also — millions of people have taken it , the company did studies , the fda looked at it — all good .
and i said , &quot; &quot; oh . &quot; &quot; because those had been in the news lately .
a somatic cell , a body cell , was taken from its body , gestated in the ovum of a cow , and then that cow gave birth to a guar .
now , i don &apos;t know exactly where it &apos;s going , but i &apos;ve got a bit of effort involved in this thing .
but obviously , there wasn &apos;t a lot i could do about it .
it hurts me , too .
it &apos;s the president of harvard . it &apos;s 1871 .
and that &apos;s the ability to exploit opposing ideas and opposing constraints to create new solutions .
but if that &apos;s it and that becomes the reason that renewables don &apos;t get invested in , then , long-term , we &apos;re screwed anyway , right ?
helping africa is noble .
i buried some of our new vehicle engines , i buried it to save it .
we can run the score up against anybody , and then get our asses kicked in the second half — what they call fourth generation warfare .
and everything looks normal except the children &apos;s faces .
so does that mean we have nothing to worry about ?
to get rid of nuclear weapons and to end the supply of the materials required to produce them , some experts tell me would take 30 years .
national rating at that time , national rating , the aids and the tuberculosis &#91; rating &#93; , was always on the top 10 list for zip codes for cities across the nation , or just zip codes across the nation .
the bad news is that &apos;s not true .
now , obviously i can &apos;t do all of them , so a few highlights for you : the highest ranked g7 country is canada .
( laughter ) you know that all of the cool people are — they &apos;re doing it .
this child matters .
you &apos;ll find out why it &apos;s called a bristlecone pine . a little sensory experience .
and what i &apos;ve found is that the process of designing and building electronics is problematic in all sorts of ways .
would they give me academic journals so i could scribble in the margins ?
the recent wars in iraq and afghanistan have produced , thank god , a casualty rate about one third of what it was in vietnam .
but back then , we noticed that detail and we fixed it , and now everyone else does that as well .
now , we basically have to change our views slightly .
and so , to my great surprise , i found that going nowhere was at least as exciting as going to tibet or to cuba .
so if you were thinking of buying an ipad , forget about it . this is what you want instead .
the majority of our functional brain is distributed over the outer surface layer of the brain , and to increase the area that &apos;s available for mental capacity , the brain surface is highly folded .
warren berger says that design thinking teaches us to look sideways , to reframe , to refine , to experiment and , probably most importantly , ask those stupid questions .
and then the skin — the edges of this — all promote the dynamic , the movement of the building as a series of seismic shifts , geologic shifts . right ?
it is ourselves we are helping .
this is now the largest crowd-funded science project that we know of — over 8,000 people have signed up at this point .
i couldn &apos;t understand the starvation , the destruction , the killing of innocent people .
actually , i &apos;m even here speaking as a middle class white man .
so last october , in gentleman scholar tradition , i put the entire collection online as &quot; &quot; museum of four in the morning . &quot; &quot; you can click on that red &quot; &quot; refresh &quot; &quot; button .
so let &apos;s look at this ceiling and see storytelling gone global .
the doors can actually swap out , so you can actually put on a rigid panel with a window unit in it for climate control , or a connector module that would allow you to actually connect multiple units together , which gives you larger and kind of compartmentalized living spaces , so now this same kit of parts , this same unit can actually serve as a living room , bedroom or bathroom , or an office , a living space and secure storage .
and that was to recognize that when you sit around the table , the actual location of the people becomes rather important .
so last year , on the fourth of july , experiments at the large hadron collider discovered the higgs boson .
but he &apos;s an absolute genius when it comes to design .
on the weekend , your choice .
my phone is a slot machine .
we &apos;re looking for images that shine an uncompromising light on crucial issues , images that transcend borders , that transcend religions , images that provoke us to step up and do something — in other words , to act .
and the scarcity of resources for dealing with these problems is only growing , certainly in the advanced world today , with all the fiscal problems we face .
it pours out millions of gallons every hour , and supplies drinking water to at least 300 million people , and washes many , many babies , and of course feeds many , many animals , both domestic and wild , produces thousands of tons of rice .
it starts of with the very small ones , which are one carbon , four hydrogen — that &apos;s methane — it just floats off .
social relations and exchange become significantly more important than they ever were as an economic phenomenon . in some contexts , it &apos;s even more efficient because of the quality of the information , the ability to find the best person , the lower transaction costs . it &apos;s sustainable and growing fast .
and something about it just kind of drew me towards it .
we were surrounded by thousands of acres of cotton fields .
it &apos;s titled , &quot; &quot; an american index of the hidden and unfamiliar , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s comprised of nearly 70 images .
my early canvases ended up being things that you wouldn &apos;t expect to be used as canvas , like fried food .
so what is the air ?
the rules are like the notes on the page , and that gets you started , but then you dance around the notes on the page , coming up with just the right combination for this particular moment with this particular set of fellow players .
well you might have , but i don &apos;t think so .
i &apos;m not supposed to care when black youth are harassed by police , because my white-looking jewish kids probably won &apos;t ever get pulled over for the crime of driving while black .
in fact , one of the things that i did just for amusement purposes is we can now write things in this code .
now i have done the impossible not once , but many times .
and this is a completely different song .
we think a lot of good can come from this technology .
it &apos;s kind of a well-kept secret .
we need to stop shouting and start talking .
let me quickly give you three examples of startups that personally inspire me .
it &apos;s actually emitting ultrasound — low-level ultrasound — that &apos;s about 100,000 vibrations per second .
now harry butler , who most australians would know is a famous naturalist , had spent a lot of time in the marine environment .
the people who received this message showed a marked decrease in energy consumption simply by being told what their neighbors were doing .
for so many years we have fed on aid .
this man was in an ngo feeding center , being helped as much as he could be helped .
but the point is that when i was first in gombe in 1960 — i remember so well , so vividly , as though it was yesterday — the first time , when i was going through the vegetation , the chimpanzees were still running away from me , for the most part , although some were a little bit acclimatized — and i saw this dark shape , hunched over a termite mound , and i peered with my binoculars .
and tennis is global .
we don &apos;t talk about that as men .
so he &apos;s really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today .
and in subsequent climbs they could never find that ant again , and so no specimens have ever been collected .
they are often the precursor to bigger things .
what are we to do ? we are faced with a paradox .
but the age of empires is gone .
i see it everywhere .
and so it is not any one stripe or something that tells me i have a virus of a particular type here ; it &apos;s the barcode that in bulk represents the whole thing .
and he was kept there by the owner &apos;s calm insistence .
above 50,000 feet you need a space suit , a pressure suit .
the picture behind me was snapped by the copilot in our chase aircraft just moments after the wheels got off the ground for the first time .
but at the same time , it &apos;s my responsibility to teach a large course to undergraduates on the brain , and that &apos;s a big subject , and it takes quite a while to organize that , and it &apos;s quite challenging and it &apos;s quite interesting , but i have to say , it &apos;s not so exhilarating .
if you live up here , in summer the sun is coming fairly directly down , but in winter it &apos;s coming through a huge amount of atmosphere , and much of the ultraviolet is weeded out , and the range of wavelengths that hit the earth are different from summer to winter .
the other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently when you have very few ophthalmologists ?
and that urbanization is extraordinary , accelerated pace .
here we are . unfortunately , i can &apos;t show you a picture of this symmetrical object .
and the third is the focusing illusion , and it &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about any circumstance that affects well-being without distorting its importance .
i want to talk to you about one of the biggest myths in medicine , and that is the idea that all we need are more medical breakthroughs and then all of our problems will be solved .
this is a real challenge to do this , because animals , when you start to really look inside them — how they work — appear hopelessly complex . there &apos;s no detailed history of the design plans , you can &apos;t go look it up anywhere .
this is probably a fairly small piece of mathematica code that &apos;s able to be run here .
bruce bueno de mesquita : i &apos;ve thought about that , and since i &apos;ve done a lot of work for the intelligence community , they &apos;ve also pondered that .
when i first realized that we had no option as scientists but to use much-vilified livestock to address climate change and desertification , i was faced with a real dilemma .
there is some danger , there is some trap . one trap : the vertical .
it is unimaginably small .
so it turns out there &apos;s a keyboard shortcut that lets you jump directly to the beep like this .
i don &apos;t really see it , i don &apos;t pay attention to it until there &apos;s , you know , like a bug that &apos;s dead on the window .
thank you very much .
i want to stay out of the way .
and it got worse , not better .
and yet , i would like to think that i am more than my genes .
if you look at most of the world &apos;s major religions , you will find seekers — moses , jesus , buddha , muhammad — seekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness , where they then have profound epiphanies and revelations that they then bring back to the rest of the community .
what i &apos;ve shown you here is sometimes called a major transition in evolutionary history .
and you &apos;re still learning who you are .
sp : but can reason lead us in directions that are good or decent or moral ?
and it &apos;s a great thing actually that nobody &apos;s had to think about it here today because it means that we can take this for granted .
here &apos;s a time lapse of one of the time-lapse units being made .
what will that lead to ?
( video ) dr. jason topping : my name is jason topping .
so i approached my phd supervisor , professor rachel calam , with the idea of using my academic skills to make some change in the real world .
you get an algorithm that you can program in a binary code , and that &apos;s the defining trait of the computer program .
we dropped them gently in .
here we go .
so nowadays , everyone could produce his mono product .
and here is my beloved briefcase , also rescued from that morning .
it &apos;s very difficult to be healthy on a planet where we &apos;ve poisoned the earth and the sea and the air .
and that was no coincidence .
with aculab and patientslikeme , we &apos;re aiming to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals .
the staircase takes us from the experience of life as profane or ordinary upwards to the experience of life as sacred , or deeply interconnected .
now here &apos;s a conference in which people talk about the future , and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000 .
i mean , all of the ballroom dance geeking out that we had always done on why salsa worked differently than the competitive rumba and why tango traveled unlike the waltz , all of that just hit the public consciousness , and it changed everything .
now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid .
it gets even worse than that . let me just walk you through this one .
these guys are all shrinking , the power is all drifting out here , so the outcome is going to be the weapons-grade fuel .
and that &apos;s what you see in the last rose bowl , you know , when we entered one of the floats .
and that &apos;s important for many fronts , and one of them is because of that culture that &apos;s in agriculture .
but in the 1970s , the energy crisis struck , and customers started thinking about how to save energy .
let me turn the trails on , so you can see that a little bit better .
deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes , those brain cells die , they never come back .
the solidarity of millions of yemenis across the country just demanding the one thing .
so this photograph was taken last month by ryan with an iphone .
we could understand it here , though .
yeah , good .
paul ? come on , stand up .
it &apos;s more profound than that .
so there &apos;s about 86 billion neurons in our brain .
and what he showed me and what he can show all of us , i think , is that the great thing for chefs , the great blessing for chefs , and for people that care about food and cooking , is that the most ecological choice for food is also the most ethical choice for food .
in 1998 , the people of indonesia took to the streets and overthrew their longtime dictator , suharto .
( laughter ) ( applause ) now , in three short years , we &apos;ve come a long way with stand-up comedy shows happening even in saudi arabia .
at these large-scale construction sites in china , you see a sort of makeshift camp where workers live during the entire building process .
anyway , so the biggest thing that &apos;s invisible to us is what we don &apos;t know .
then i saw our chancellor coming to school in denims and turtlenecks , and thought , it &apos;s not right for me to keep this other &#91; rule &#93; so i let them just — they had to be neat and clean .
and i want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands , great mothers , friends , daughters , sons .
and what happened next was that i entered this state of pure , unprejudiced amazement .
video : don blankenship : let me be clear about it . al gore , nancy pelosi , harry reid , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations .
well , actually , it is .
and we built a probability map of where they might have been .
and because it &apos;s easy for the buyer to change allegiance whenever they want , the only way of trusting a vendor is if they have a good history of positive feedback from other users of the site .
so the temperature required for fusion is 150 billion degrees c.
that was a big deal ; that was important . he worked for kodak for a while ; that was important .
this often creates a good cop / bad cop dynamic in which the copy editor — i &apos;ll use that as an umbrella term — is invariably the bad cop .
main result is that there is tremendous confusion .
well , not exactly everyone , because the u.s. intelligence only has a legal right to monitor foreigners .
when i was just about to give everything up after years of suffering , i started to rediscover the true power of music .
what they haven &apos;t been so good about instructing people is the problem of darkly pigmented people living in high latitude areas , or working inside all the time .
essilor stays ahead of its game , and has delivered spectacular performance for over 40 years , by using the principles of prudence and adaptation .
a poetic image for a story on tolstoy , by sam abell .
right now , we don &apos;t really have a bead on that .
( laughter ) but the truth is that i had a very happy childhood , full of laughter and love , in a very close-knit family .
they &apos;re easy , they &apos;re cheap , because instead of making places , we &apos;re making memories of places .
so it can actually hold itself in very strong currents , as you see here .
we got a lot of people thinking about electric cars , what you could do with them . a few years later , when we suggested to gm that now is the time and we could do a thing called the impact , they sponsored it , and here &apos;s the impact that we developed with them on their programs . this is the demonstrator . and they put huge effort into turning it into a commercial product .
and she &apos;s just turned 18 .
thelma nichols : inmate number 0b2472 .
the head nurse told me proudly , &quot; you see , our children are very well-behaved . &quot;

he &apos;s coming up to one of my graduate students and flipper patting , which he would do to a female penguin .
and then i pasted huge posters everywhere in the bourgeois area of paris with the name , age , even building number of these guys .
i had nothing to offer and no one had anything to offer me .
if you were not , you maybe had to go through an operator .
now it turns out , in the mathematics , you can put it in as a term that &apos;s an energy , but it &apos;s a completely different type of energy from anything we &apos;ve ever seen before .
that so many of the city &apos;s most venerable taxpayers have survived yet another commercial building boom , is cause for celebration .
he &apos;d be torn apart by the bitter divisiveness of sectarianism .
and we just put these two together in the same system .
but what are you going to do with a flat track pad , those square things ?
it &apos;s a beard trimmer , you see ?
now , i know that &apos;s a dirty word for some people , but we evolved from common ancestors with the gorillas , the chimpanzee and also the bonobos .
he said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot; &quot; and i have to tell you , it was energizing .
but if you consider the green part of the brain stem , nothing like that happens .
so , i started collecting found objects .
but why are there so many orphans in europe when there hasn &apos;t been a great deal of war or disaster in recent years ?
it &apos;s not an equally great answer and my reply to that is usually , &quot; &quot; try to google the word &apos; search engine , &apos; you may find a couple of interesting alternatives . &quot; &quot; and last but not least , thirdly , inevitably , one student will raise her or his hand and say , &quot; with google , i &apos;m certain to always get the best , unbiased search result . &quot;
what is the real thing that you should be afraid of ?
i learned very few things in addition since ( laughter ) — but made a whole number of them into projects since .
these are the 15 commodities that fundamentally pose the biggest threats to these places because of deforestation , soil loss , water use , pesticide use , over-fishing , etc .
with this factory and 100,000 planes a year , we could make all of america &apos;s electricity in about 10 years .
the ability to make and test models has become essential , not only to every single area of science today , but also to modern society itself .
we happened to win , just recently , the green product of the year for &quot; &quot; the re-invention of drywall , &quot; &quot; from popular science .
it &apos;s the essence of the design process .
but the one thing that i always looked forward to was playing around with my cousins .
again , not a single one of them — i think there are about seven or eight of them — thought this would do any good . they thought this was a temporary change .
but that didn &apos;t happen .
so , solving the problem of pollution with more pollution .
in other words , we &apos;re raising our girls to be perfect , and we &apos;re raising our boys to be brave .
this is dave clearing the airspace with the faa for 15 miles .
and if we really want to get out of this economic mess , if we really want high performance on those definitional tasks of the 21st century , the solution is not to do more of the wrong things , to entice people with a sweeter carrot , or threaten them with a sharper stick .
but it changes fundamentally our governance and management paradigm , from the current linear , command and control thinking , looking at efficiencies and optimization towards a much more flexible , a much more adaptive approach , where we recognize that redundancy , both in social and environmental systems , is key to be able to deal with a turbulent era of global change .
and it &apos;s that choice that i want to focus on , because as we migrate lethal decision-making from humans to software , we risk not only taking the humanity out of war , but also changing our social landscape entirely , far from the battlefield .
another example is a group of designers who were working on a surgical instrument with some surgeons .
all right . very good . about half .
so — and that &apos;s a song about how everybody &apos;s miserable because , you know , we &apos;re from russia .
i have to tell it , because there was no one to put two and two together .

this is scary because when the economy doesn &apos;t grow , our children don &apos;t get better lives .
we can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours .
many barriers are breaking down .
actually no generator is 24 / 7 . they all break .
i know how it can look really bad .
he told me to stop , take my backpack off and put my hands on the police car parked next to us .
i was here , planting my chunks , cutting up potatoes and planting it , and the bees were working on this tree ; bumblebees , just making this thing vibrate .
and you can show , just by looking at data from literature , that vector-borne diseases are more harmful than non-vector-borne diseases .
it wasn &apos;t until i entered high school that i thought , &quot; &quot; maybe now , you know — being a big high school kid — i can maybe become an active part of this big medical world . &quot; &quot; i was 14 , and i emailed professors at the local university to see if maybe i could go work in their lab . and hardly anyone responded .
we don &apos;t like to give up our special-ness , so , you know , having the idea that robots could really have emotions , or that robots could be living creatures — i think is going to be hard for us to accept .
and he turned to my mother , and he said , &quot; &quot; you haven &apos;t told her yet ? &quot; &quot; on my seventeenth birthday , as janis ian would best say , i learned the truth at 17 .
his photo was remembered by all of us .
so because of having cooked food , it &apos;s easier to digest .
we have zero infrastructure .
i &apos;ve been temporarily detained .
now just like the physical maps of our world that have been highly influenced by technology — think google maps , think gps — the same thing is happening for brain mapping through transformation .
so there &apos;s something about aging that &apos;s kind of universal .
aerial images could also be processed to produce three-dimensional computer models of forests .
but anyway , the cops down at the precinct charged chuck with receiving stolen property .
we see rocks .
you &apos;ve got to think , and i &apos;m going to ask you some questions .
to understand even something as important to us as happiness , you kind of have to branch off in all these different directions , and there &apos;s nowhere that i &apos;ve discovered — other than ted — where you can ask that many questions in that many different directions .
edward snowden shined a light on an important need that people had to understand .
and even stranger , there were these people , these beekeepers , that loved their bees like they were family , and when i put down the book , i knew i had to see this for myself .
another world is possible .
so some solutions to heat can provide for win-win-wins .
i had a rigorous scientific transect .
gas is a similar issue . gas is also a biological product . and as you think of gas , well , you &apos;re familiar with gas . and here &apos;s a different way of mining coal .
the object itself just means nothing .
and sure enough , if you sit down , and you analyze all this data on spaghetti sauce , you realize that all americans fall into one of three groups .
all the little details — the curb return radius .
( applause ) increasingly in developed countries , women are socialized to believe that our place is no longer only in the home , but men are actually still where they always were .
he reached down . he pulled a lever . and the chair sank down .
now , a lot of parents , when they adopt , actually want to erase their children &apos;s history .
in brazil , they are usually first sent to governmental triage facilities , in which most of the cases , the conditions are as bad as with the traffickers .
seven to one is the ratio , they tend to say .
lucky me .
one way of describing the plutocrats is as alpha geeks , and they are people who are acutely aware of how important highly sophisticated analytical and quantitative skills are in today &apos;s economy .
so why does good sex so often fade ?
we really are seeing the dawn of interventional surgery .
so combine those with the adventurous outliers from new generations of locally trained architects and designers and engineers , and always remember that you are designing for curving , tapering , hollow poles .
so — ( laughter ) i announced what we were going to do in a broadcast interview , and straightaway , the emails started coming .
a team of doctors in europe published a series of papers about colonoscopies .
say a new super bug has emerged .
i also started looking around in the city and trying to photograph them .
i believe that is what is happening .
and as we watch it , we are ashamed .
that &apos;s where those big peaks are over to the left .
but with this in mind , we organized this expedition , which was the closest civilians have been to the nuclear power plant .
one advantage of that is that you can allocate money coherently .
we have a responsibility to try .
i mean , i &apos;d thought about the harbour bridge or bondi beach , but minto ? but still , i &apos;m a producer , and the lure of a site-specific theater project was more than i could resist . ( laughter ) so , off i went into friday afternoon traffic , and i &apos;ll never forget what i saw when i got there .
raisuddin : &quot; &quot; mark , you should know that i am praying for god , the most compassionate and gracious .
see , i &apos;m a computer scientist by background and not someone in the creative arts .
they want to be dual-career , dual-carer couples .
hold your hand out flat . open it up .
it can be put up in any environment , from an asphalt parking lot to pastures or fields , because it doesn &apos;t require any special setup or specialty tools .
and i keep it going , and i just got , ( laughter ) also , this suggestion from milan : it &apos;s our traffic divider , which we call &quot; &quot; panettone , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s painted ; it &apos;s these beautiful concrete things that you use around milan to define all the lanes of traffic .
so you take a look out in the real world , and the fun thing is you can actually hack these yourself .
the adoptive parents were lined up .
( applause ) and look what it does with its foot to get over challenging terrain .
before that i feel like i wasn &apos;t like this .
he grew the bushy black beard that obscured his face .
it &apos;s not called costuming at cons , it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; cosplay . &quot; &quot; now ostensibly , cosplay means people who dress up as their favorite characters from film and television and especially anime , but it is so much more than that .
100 bucks . that &apos;s the price-improvement curve that — we need some breakthroughs in physics along the way , i &apos;ll grant you that .
the asian free trade zone , almost free trade zone , that &apos;s emerging now has a greater trade volume than trade across the pacific .
so we &apos;re just beginning to explore what &apos;s possible when we use software to control the movement of objects in our environment .
and more importantly , when you &apos;re actually at the site of the memorial , you can see those connections .
average humidity worldwide has gone up four percent .
and i &apos;m glad i &apos;m a bee man and not a bat man , because there &apos;s no money to research the bat problems .
and actually , i spend as much of my time in clinic dealing with the emotional adjustment of patients as with the physical disability .
and all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce .
i went to mit , did my math , but i had this wonderful opportunity , because computers had just become visual .
to start simply , i want to say that compassion is kind .
or a 16-year-old girl who built an algorithm to help detect whether a cancer is benign or malignant in the off chance that she can save her daddy &apos;s life because he has cancer .
let me tell you a little bit about this chemistry of oil .
they were so focused on their own individual work , they didn &apos;t even know who they were sitting next to , and it was only when i insisted that we stop working and invest time in getting to know each other that we achieved real momentum .
at this point , you may be wondering what city officials think of all this .
so here &apos;s a typical situation , male meets female , lots of offspring .
and in 1996 , i found the answer in principles in a master spoken-word artist named reg e. gaines , who wrote the famous poem , &quot; &quot; please don &apos;t take my air jordans . &quot; &quot; and i followed this guy everywhere until i had him in the room , and i read him one of my pieces , and you know what he told me ?
ok . and what we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re going to immerse ourselves in my world .
facts were actually banished from our home .
most of those missing puzzle pieces are southern continents , because it was those continents that are least explored .
and that &apos;s architecture .
interviewer : so you &apos;ve got to put your feet out sideways .
and i &apos;m going to take that idea and apply it to other sort of iconic things from my life .
thank you .
i was almost a foot taller than my father .
it shows that it &apos;s essentially impossible until now to develop a science of economics because we are sentient beings who anticipate and there is a problem of self-fulfilling prophesies .
you can go to places like this .
ask any 10-year-old girl if she wants to go to mars .
audience : yellow.db : good .
but i didn &apos;t let that daunt me .
the denominator of the gymnosophist &apos;s life was infinity .
let me tell you a little bit about a couple of new deceptions we &apos;ve been tracking and documenting .
second story .
dk : lots of loudspeakers , quite frankly .
walt whitman also did this back in the day , before there was internet technology . sock puppet becomes interesting when we get to scale , which is the domain of the chinese water army .
i mean , they took — they had a technology disruption , and rather than taking a business model innovation to correspond to that , they took and sought a legal solution and the industry that brought you elvis and the beatles is now suing children and is in danger of collapse .
we tell stories all the time about everything , and i think we do it because the world is kind of a crazy , chaotic place , and sometimes stories , we &apos;re trying to make sense of the world a little bit , trying to bring some order to it .
we worked with , by the way , honeybee robotics . this is the brain .
lisa o &apos;connell , a dramaturge and director of a playwright center , pulled us aside after the show and said , &quot; do you have any idea how political that was ? &quot;
yes , it &apos;s uphill the entire way , because the south pole is at 10,000 feet , and you &apos;re starting at sea level .
i was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict , and all the day they were having a party , they celebrated , all of south central , all the churches . and they say , &apos; well , finally justice has been done in this society . &apos; well , what about victims &apos; rights ?
that i wanted to do as an extension of my composition , as an extension of a kind of creative impulse .
now we need you to take this story out to tell it to the people who will listen and educate them on what it means to beat ebola , and more importantly , we need you to advocate with the people who can help us bring the resources we need to these countries , to beat this disease .
and that as we worry about our next job in the office , the next design that we can get , to keep our workers .
well , one obvious barrier is cost .
and finally , they have a different model of scale , and it &apos;s a chinese restaurant model of how to scale .
and then i ask myself , &quot; &quot; why was it ever small ? &quot; &quot; isn &apos;t it weird ? you know , if collaboration is so cool , is cross-functional working is so amazing , why did we build these huge hierarchies ? what &apos;s going on ?
dude , can you , all right , can you just keep it down ?
so what happens , if you want to sustain desire , it &apos;s that real dialectic piece .
he used a pseudonym like bull walker , or later , the masked marvel .
it &apos;s not something specific to humans — it &apos;s a really ancient behavior which really helps us regulate how we feel and makes us feel better .
i got infected when i was 17 , when , as a student of the design college , i encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas , challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me .
now , there are three ways that i think infidelity hurts differently today .
they had a very strong preference for biting on the face .
but think about it .
but about , oh , 15 months after i got to cambridge , a rumor began to appear from linus pauling &apos;s son , who was in cambridge , that his father was now working on dna .
it &apos;s a heavy element produced in thermonuclear explosions of supernovae .
the poem reacts to old lipstick ads , and its edginess about statement , its reversals and halts , have everything to do with resisting the language of ads that want to tell us so easily what to want , what to do , what to think .
things like , how do we measure ourselves as humans ?
years later , she moved to america .
we all knew about the risks , and how terrifying the journey is , and i met many people who lost loved ones at sea .
so as i said , i think bread is a transformational food .
it means if i get to the end of my life , the universe can &apos;t turn to me and go , &quot; &quot; what have you been doing , you idiot ?
and when a number of filaments come together in a knot , that makes a supercluster of galaxies .
and i &apos;ll tell you why .
and then a few weeks later we can take out the cartilage scaffold .
( applause )
much as these flows do all that good , there are barriers to these flows of remittances , these 400 billion dollars of remittances .
this is a 10-kiloton bomb , slightly smaller than was used in hiroshima . and i want to just conclude this by just giving you some information . i think — &quot; &quot; news you could use &quot; &quot; kind of concept here .
so what if we analyze these two groups separately — the famous and the non-famous ?
the year was 2011 and all over southern africa and the whole continent , affordable data packages for smartphones and internet surfing became much easier to get .
and i leave feeling actually unhappy .
they sell 1.5 billion servings every single day .
it would not be the first time a poet had written the poem that he wanted to hear .
and so they got to work and they went to cities across the country and got regulations put in place to slow down the growth of the jitney .
using the old thinking , of national infrastructure and pipe work , is too expensive .
every day we &apos;re connecting more and more of our lives to the internet , which means that the internet of things will soon be the internet of things to be hacked .
because each unit knows where it is in space and is self-controlled , there is really no limit to their number .
we &apos;re going to do some jokes , some gags , some little skits — and then we &apos;re going to talk about the l1 point .
i was no more than just a commodity .
and how do i create my own life ?
in the front , there are 10 ranches strung right along the base of the mountains using the water from the mountains .
and if this is the end of my five minutes , i want to tell you that i actually did survive , which was a surprise .
in the end , 300 people were gravely wounded and over 172 men , women and children lost their lives that day .
and in short order , thousands of people were building our machine .
we had this little bond .
and the question is : how did we come from there to here ?
we then managed to set up a war crimes tribunal to deal specifically with those kinds of issues .
the fact that he lives a five-minute drive from my parents &apos; home made it easier to follow him through the years .
so today we &apos;re going to show you one example of how you can use this .
we are ordinary people attempting to do extraordinary things , and so we need to be supported in that way .
i &apos;m here to show you how something you can &apos;t see can be so much fun to look at .
nature has been doing that for a long time .
and generally , the people would say , oh , well that &apos;s bad news .
and people were like , &quot; &quot; we knew they were vicious . we knew they were . &quot; &quot; and so people love to form their opinions .
i labored in that vineyard for a quarter century before making my way to a little kingdom of the just in upstate south carolina , a methodist-affiliated institution of higher learning called wofford college .
but we are going to have to decide between zero and sum .
what i need is a system where i put out my hand and — poof ! — the product shows up and i pack it into the order , and now we &apos;re thinking , this would be a very operator-centric approach to solving the problem .
so if we want to make cells happy outside our bodies , we need to become cell architects .
and so everyone can be at least happy to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas .
in about two to three hours , she started to move .
and the work we have been doing was completely difficult to do and to achieve it .
i &apos;m playing around with how we view something , and i &apos;m doing it very deliberately .
and beavers , like wolves , are ecosystem engineers .
now imagine doing this test for other planets .
but i wouldn &apos;t have you think that i don &apos;t like the place on the right , which i quite do . i &apos;ve come to love the city and its kind of diversity , and its resilience , and its dependence on density and how we &apos;re connected together .
and they spread , actually , very quickly , even outside the u.s.
this is a world in which there &apos;s no electricity , there &apos;s no money , there &apos;s no medical competence .
♫ you ’ re my clonie . ♫ &quot; &quot; oh clonie , how i love you . &quot; &quot; &quot; ha , i &apos;m the only person i ever loved . &quot;
he didn &apos;t mention the speed . your eye is constantly in motion , moving around , looking at eyes , noses , elbows , looking at interesting things in the world .
and i find this incredible .
the bottom players , you see all the activity in dorsomedial pfc .
but that doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re a bad basketball player .
and the second ingredient , which would solve mobility , that very difficult challenge in developing countries , in a very low-cost and simple way , would be to have hundreds of kilometers of streets only for buses , buses and bicycles and pedestrians .
but they all have one thing in common : they all need to look like something .
the system is reliable but the problem is you never know how well a strain is going to grow .
that is a wonderful thing .
and together , we can help create a sustainable world , and , if we get it right , we can make sustainability affordable for the many people , not a luxury for the few .
and to talk about that , i &apos;m going to go back to the beginning , because in the beginning were commodities .
( applause ) i mean , the new york times recently called for an amnesty for you .
thank you .
did people see the movie &quot; &quot; ai &quot; &quot; ? ( audience : yes . ) rb : yeah , it was really bad , but — remember , especially when haley joel osment , the little robot , looked at the blue fairy for 2,000 years without taking his eyes off it ?
they weren &apos;t there before , and then zzzzzt !
this is a really basic , basic prosthetic limb under here .
it &apos;s about 3.3 billion pounds per year out of 620 billion .
well , i &apos;ll tell you — a lot .
so the ancient greeks knew that dogs sent invisible signals between each other .
it ’ s true that some humans eat better than others .
the shared spaces are also treated in the same manner , where walls are decorated in faux marble patterns .
we have g.m. crops , we have pharmaceuticals , we have new vaccines , all using roughly the same technology , but with very different outcomes .
they &apos;re laughing because he said , draw from the middle-right to the middle , and he kind of messed up .
now , you can see united states , in 1983 , had a very low percentage infected , but due to the big population , still a sizable bubble .
wait till you see , maybe next year , what kind of windows we &apos;ve invented .
and so i thought , how could we address the energy crisis in this country ?
while making the book , we took great care that none of the illustrations were objectionable in any way and that it is culturally sensitive .
( applause ) it is possible to create emotionally and physically safe classrooms where students also thrive academically .
so , how cheap is it ?
now you and i could look at this and we could argue about whether it &apos;s incremental , and i could say something like &quot; &quot; 80-20 rule , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s really hard to move up to that new curve .
look at the fat layer .
that i tried to do .
the global commission on drug policy really knew its opposition , and rather than fighting them , our chair — former brazilian president fernando henrique cardoso — reached out to leaders from across the political spectrum , from liberals to conservatives .
it may have built a road , and that road may have served a very good role .
and the question i get when i start talking about this most often is , &quot; what made you interested in this subject ? &quot;
we &apos;re tagging on the california coast , and we &apos;re tagging over in taiwan and japan .
thanks to ligo , we know how to build exquisite detectors that can listen to the universe , to the rustle and the chirp of the cosmos .
and everything that everybody is talking about today isn &apos;t possible if we keep having an educational system that does not value these qualities , because we won &apos;t get there with a standardized test , and we won &apos;t get there with a culture of one right answer .
and it was this interaction between that kind of , up-the-ante stuff that became pretty interesting .
and here i &apos;ll zoom in a little bit . we &apos;re looking right there in the center .
and they came down on the side of open publication , which is the right approach — we &apos;ve briefed the white house , we &apos;ve briefed members of congress , we &apos;ve tried to take and push the policy issues in parallel with the scientific advances .
i eventually made it to hawaii still alive .
if i owned the internet , napster , monster and friendster.com would be one big website .
i spend a lot of my time thinking about how to spend my time .
same strategy .
child : when i watch tv , it &apos;s just some shows that you just — that are pretend , and when you explore , you get more imagination than you already had , and when you get more imagination , it makes you want to go deeper in so you can get more and see beautifuller things , like the path , if it &apos;s a path , it could lead you to a beach , or something , and it could be beautiful .
there are kunskapsskolan schools in sweden .
i went back to the states , anticipating i &apos;d return to europe , but the heart catheterization showed that i wasn &apos;t going anywhere further that a flight-for-life from johns hopkins hospital .
they &apos;ve never made money .
audience : ♫ aaaaaaah ... ♫ itay talgam : come on , with me . if you do it without me i feel even more redundant than i already feel .
green chemistry is chemistry in water .
we probably wouldn &apos;t still be here today if we weren &apos;t so resistant to change .
they also happen to be particularly adept at working the international tax system so as to lower their tax bill very , very significantly .
and it was looking good for a while , but i left it outside , because you had to leave it outside to dry , and unfortunately i came back and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato .
is this the kind of society we want to build , without even knowing we &apos;ve done this , because we turned decision-making to machines we don &apos;t totally understand ?
instead of seeing its primary objective as consumption , design thinking is beginning to explore the potential of participation — the shift from a passive relationship between consumer and producer to the active engagement of everyone in experiences that are meaningful , productive and profitable .
and there &apos;s only data where there is light .
and of course you might think that doing a film on happiness might not really be worthwhile .
imagine in the physical world if somebody followed our children around with a camera and a notebook and recorded their every movement .
life itself has existed for billions of years and has continually adapted to use materials effectively .
she said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m 61 . &quot; &quot; he grinned , said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m 59 . &quot; &quot; today i ’ ve had a really nice time , so tomorrow if you wanted you could come over to mine ?
but i see something profoundly transformative in experiencing death as a social process and not just a biological one .
we added weights to their ankles that amounted to 15 percent of their body weight .
this is what we will do today .
religion is more than belief .
and we know the solar output &apos;s not constant through time .
a crystalline stackable principle in the center on the top , which i am trying to turn into a concert hall in iceland .
just like matter can exist as liquid or solid , so the higgs field , the substance that fills all space-time , could exist in two states .
so lesbor , we blend the two .
the town had a vermiculite mine in it .
and then spock turns round , he goes , &quot; &quot; james , i know all of the brahms waltzes , and i don &apos;t believe this is one of them in the category . &quot; &quot; that &apos;s where i &apos;m at .
the more techniques you know , the more things you can make , and the more patterns you can recognize in things you might already like or love .
what about art ?
and i thought a lot about , what was my daughter &apos;s life going to be like without me ?
so you &apos;ll see images of this remarkable building .
and so , it &apos;s a very dynamic , and i think , historic and exciting community to be involved with .
it &apos;s not taught in universities .
and i am on this stage because i am a model .
nothing really interesting , basically .
it &apos;s true too in argentina on the patagonian shelf , which is now in serious trouble .
satellites like these have done an amazing job at helping us to understand our planet .
he said , &quot; &quot; he who receives an idea from me receives instruction himself , without lessening mine .
today , we know that this future vision didn &apos;t come true .
to build that , what we &apos;d do with whirlwind technology is we &apos;d have to take up roughly from the 10 to mulholland , and from the 405 to la cienega just with those whirlwinds .
they got you out of purgatory faster .
( laughter ) a particularly dramatic example of this comes from a neurological disorder known as capgras syndrome .
yeah , thought so . so we ’ ve all seen it , haven ’ t we ?
and that day i knew that when i grew up , i was going to become a brain doctor , scientist , something or the other .
we &apos;re looking at attacking energy , environment , nanotechnology — and i &apos;ll talk about those more in a moment .
but again , they have the same static physical form for each of these applications .
and westerners — europeans or americans — who didn &apos;t know about this before , &#91; saw &#93; this practice within some of the muslim communities who migrated from north africa .
my girlfriend at the time , who &apos;s no longer my girlfriend — ( laughter ) — hated it .
language evolved to solve the crisis of visual theft .
signs of their outrage ...
take , for example , this beautiful blue nacre shell .
3d printers instantaneously produce any customized design .
at first it was pretty sensible . we flew british airways to moscow .
so one of the things we discovered is where are the hot spots of diversity ?
that &apos;s the only space she could express her creativity .
uberx , when we first started , was literally 10 or 15 percent cheaper than our black car product .
hi . my name is cameron russell , and for the last little while , i &apos;ve been a model .
but it is going to happen in this century .
and at the trial , her trial , a very distinguished pediatrician gave evidence that the chance of two cot deaths , innocent deaths , in a family like hers — which was professional and non-smoking — was one in 73 million .
and this is the reason : in two countries that hadn &apos;t had this disease for more than probably a decade , on opposite sides of the globe , there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks .
( music ) ( video ) child : today , i had some octyphenols , some artificial musks and some bisphenol a.
meetup , a service founded so that users could find people in their local area who share their interests and affinities and actually have a real-world meeting offline in a cafe or a pub or what have you .
and i spent quite a lot of time with them rather than in punts .
but that is not my confession .
we are interacting with our entertainment .
we &apos;ve since scaled up the designs : &quot; &quot; ocean atlas , &quot; &quot; in the bahamas , rising 16 feet up to the surface and weighing over 40 tons , to now currently in lanzarote , where i &apos;m making an underwater botanical garden , the first of its kind in the atlantic ocean .
i want to be the center of attention .
we can actually do the same thing with much less energy .
the title is &quot; &quot; this happened . &quot; &quot; a student , a young woman in a fourth-floor hallway of her lycee , perched on the ledge of an open window chatting with friends between classes ; a teacher passes and chides her , &quot; be careful , you might fall , &quot; almost banteringly chides her , &quot; you might fall , &quot; and the young woman , 18 , a girl really , though she wouldn &apos;t think that , as brilliant as she is , first in her class , and &quot; &quot; beautiful , too , &quot; &quot; she &apos;s often told , smiles back , and leans into the open window , which wouldn &apos;t even be open if it were winter — if it were winter someone would have closed it ( &quot; &quot; close it ! &quot; &quot; ) —
problems from weeds , weed control , cost montana nearly 200 million dollars a year . montana has lost agricultural areas from salinization , problems of forest management , problems of forest fires . second item on my checklist : climate change . yes — the climate in montana is getting warmer and drier , but montana agriculture depends especially on irrigation from the snow pack , and as the snow is melting — for example , as the glaciers in glacier national park are disappearing — that &apos;s bad news for montana irrigation agriculture .
this bottle of oil , distilled over a hundred million years of geological time , ancient sunlight , contains the energy equivalent of about five weeks hard human manual labor — equivalent to about 35 strong people coming round and working for you .
this was me at age 13 , when i started my first diet .
at first , the spoofer was just a jumble of cables and computers , though we eventually got it packaged into a small box .
it &apos;s a geometric language .
when the santa barbara spill happened in 1969 , it formed the environmental movement in its modern form .
( applause ) we &apos;ll see where this goes . we were so excited about this that we realized that that small-size scale — and where everything gets sticky , and gravity doesn &apos;t matter anymore — we needed to look at ants and their feet , because one of my other colleagues at berkeley has built a six-millimeter silicone robot with legs . but it gets stuck . it doesn &apos;t move very well .
so , we got milk , for the american audience .
now , in the 27 years since hiv was identified as the cause of aids , we &apos;ve developed more drugs to treat hiv than all other viruses put together .
what happens is , you take pictures as the earth rotates , you get a fan across the sky .
( music : &quot; &quot; sonata in f , &quot; &quot; kv 13 , by wolfgang a. mozart ) it fits the room perfectly .
for example , the waves that hit us on september 14 — and yes , every single one of you stretched and compressed under the action of that wave — when the waves hit , they stretched the average person by one part in 10 to the 21 .
it has two big differences with traditional version control systems .
so in a way , it is everybody &apos;s business .
i was called down to the ward to see him by a respiratory physician .
he &apos;s 45 years old . he &apos;s currently enrolled in college .
isn &apos;t that incredible that we can &apos;t read each other &apos;s minds ?
we can , for example , go find miko &apos;s locker and get some more information about her .
i think usually , as companies get bigger , they find it really hard to have small , innovative projects .
we then start adding the muscle on top .
and all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers , just like designers are seeking scientists .
they love the neutrons that are going on and helping this reaction take place .
differences , freedom , choices , possibilities .
now this kingdom had many resources and mighty ambitions , but the one thing it lacked was people .

most people say , no , i &apos;m going to schlep across town to save 100 bucks on the purchase of a car ?
it was originally designed as a golfing controller to detect the motion of your swing .
because when we think about blogs , i think for most of us who are concerned about them , we &apos;re primarily concerned with things like politics , technology , etc .
and you know what ?
he was rattling off — i mean , that &apos;s amazing , i &apos;m sorry .
and we need to be very attentive and vigilant to thinking about where things that we do may unintentionally prevent them from being able to achieve their important activities .
along the way we scaled up to the 20 watt-hour cell .
in the late &apos; 90s , there was a big push for ethics in the world of investment and banking .
if you look out your window and you can see long &apos;s peak , you &apos;re probably familiar with it .
we were using armored vehicles , decoy cars , changing patterns of travel , changing homes , all sorts of security measures .
you &apos;ve really got to just throw your assumptions out the door .
so , how can we envision the city of the future ?
he was learning about our process about design thinking , about empathy , about iterative prototyping .
these are four 8.2 meter telescopes .
some of these images are degraded images of black people , kind of histories of very challenging content , and where better than a neighborhood with young people who are constantly asking themselves about their identity to talk about some of the complexities of race and class ?
that &apos;s my premise .
i held two assumptions : one , that poor people are poor in part because they &apos;re uneducated and don &apos;t make good choices ; two is that we then need people like me to figure out what they need and get it to them .
in fact , suffering is so huge and enormous , his own becomes less and less monumental .
this is one of x &apos;s mantras .
alright , lets turn to iran .
what do i mean by that ?
this now is the third different output .
it &apos;s a pretty profound statement .
but alluding to the country &apos;s continual attempts to build a postracial society after being ravaged for decades by apartheid , i tweeted , # ifafricawasabar south africa would be drinking all kinds of alcohol and begging them to get along in its stomach .
but , in any event , if you can burn it with the same efficiency — because it &apos;s external combustion — as your kitchen stove , if you can burn any fuel , it turns out to be pretty neat .
we can look at all their velocities and we can build a model that predicts what is the likelihood that this shot would go in under these circumstances ?
we decided to provide vasectomy to all men , but in particular , american men to the front of the queue , right up to the ambassador &apos;s residence during his &#91; unclear &#93; .
okay , so what ? in fact , the so what is , in the brain , changes in neural activity , the things that make your brain work , the things that make your software work in your brain , are tightly correlated with changes in blood flow .
imagine the ripples of this notion for the millions of people living and dying with dementia .
in order to do that in 20 minutes , i have to bring out four ideas — it &apos;s like four pieces of a puzzle .
ecx , moreover , can become a trading platform for a pan-african market in agricultural commodities .
and the fax said , there should be songs , there should be an &quot; &quot; i want &quot; &quot; song , there should be a happy village song , there should be a love story and there should be a villain .
so they make kind of heroic assumptions about that .
and i revisit this world thinking about the image or cliché about what we want to do , and what are the words , colloquialisms , that we have with the expressions .
now it may not seem like it , but we are .
you are speaking your truth .
you can actually see , right here , it will vibrate .
but part of this internet is being held captive by the less noble aspects of our human behavior .
the simplest element on one of these structures is 100 times that size .
promoting recycling , things like garden-share , that matches up people who don &apos;t have a garden who would like to grow food , with people who have gardens they aren &apos;t using anymore .
as i told you , geologists love craters .
we call it the electronic jellyfish .
in canada , it &apos;s 3.6 percent per year .
what &apos;s unusual about this one , maybe , is that it &apos;s from 1953 .
or , even better , let &apos;s just take people right out of the emergency room — undefined , community-acquired respiratory tract infections .
do you want to come over and listen ? &quot; &quot; and i &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; yes , ma &apos;am , i do . &quot; &quot; and she &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; well what are you going to do when you get here ? &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot; &quot; and i &apos;d go over there and i would , i would just listen .
now , when your state is collapsing , your economy is heading south at a rate of knots , the last people you want coming on to the labor market are 14,000 men and women whose chief skills are surveillance , are smuggling , building underground networks and killing people .
by the way , speaking of the filing system , it never occurred to us that these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network .
and they &apos;re learning to become like us .
i mean , that &apos;s 2005 figures .
so in order to ask evolutionary questions , we need to know about reproductive success .
it &apos;s difficult because it &apos;s a very experiential medium .
( applause ) chris anderson : really powerfully argued .
the single story creates stereotypes , and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue , but that they are incomplete .
trade and industry takes 43 billion .
in philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program , so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday , taking them home , getting access to information .
based on the other images we have , i &apos;m really happy how it looks today .
and at this rate at which we are losing fish , it is a human problem of enormous dimensions , a health problem of a kind we haven &apos;t seen before .
when i wrote my report to the koreans , i said , &quot; &quot; look , i don &apos;t know what this guy was doing , &quot; &quot; but my guess was interacting with his mother or his girlfriend .
because , you know , it &apos;s great for us , but bad for humans .
( video ) claudia : oooooh !
and i remember watching my family go through that and thinking that i never wanted another family to feel that kind of loss .
hence my motto : green is the new red , white and blue . &quot; &quot; and i asked myself , in a way , looking back , &quot; when did that kind of awareness of the planet and its fragility first appear ? &quot;
last year , i was in nairobi , in the slums , in one called korogocho — which literally means when translated , &quot; &quot; standing shoulder to shoulder . &quot; &quot; and i spoke with this women &apos;s group that &apos;s pictured here .
lastly i want to say that all of you , probably , have had some relationship at some time in your life with a dog , a cat , some sort of pet , and you recognized that those are individuals .
i &apos;m going to give you four specific examples , i &apos;m going to cover at the end about how a company called silk tripled their sales ; how an artist named jeff koons went from being a nobody to making a whole bunch of money and having a lot of impact ; to how frank gehry redefined what it meant to be an architect .
it &apos;s usually some kind of choice between the vocational and the intellectual .
you &apos;d probably kick me out , or something .
so we actually started with a number of volunteers who helped us in seattle , just over a year ago , to tag what they were throwing away — different types of things , as you can see here — things they would throw away anyway .
but how could we show these teeny-weeny things ?
and this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play .
and in that moment , i started this journey .
ca : thank you for scaring the living daylights out of us . thank you , ralph .
in many theme parks , you can pay extra to jump to the head of the line .
unfortunately , over the past quarter century , epidemic obesity has made our two-ton steel cars gain weight twice as fast as we have .
and now it &apos;s a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for .
so a lot of your vision — the bulk of it is visual , and it &apos;s pouring in .
your job is only to be human .
and we recruited wonderful staff , highly motivated staff .
before you breed .
we opened the gates for higher education for every qualified student .
or this could represent a college green .
it &apos;s &apos; technology , entertainment and design . &apos; &quot; &quot; and she said , &quot; &quot; well , you design a story when you make it up , it &apos;s entertainment when you tell it , and you &apos;re going to use a microphone . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) i said , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re a peach , ma . pop there ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s the matter ? the pearls of wisdom leaping from my lips like lemmings is no good for you ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) then my pop got on there .
it &apos;s a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits , because it &apos;s always still plastic .
because of the speed and brevity of social media , we are forced to jump to conclusions and write sharp opinions in 140 characters about complex world affairs .
and here &apos;s the thing that you need to get comfortable with when you &apos;ve given the tool to acquire information to students , is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process .
in the past , different students were taught in similar ways .
so now i want to take you to the moment of — when you &apos;re an entrepreneur , and you &apos;ve started a new company , there &apos;s the , here &apos;s all the stuff we do beforehand , and then the service launches . what happens ?
it would be a crime for all of us not to be aware when somebody shows up at a swimming pool and says one word , just one word , if you don &apos;t listen if that word is &quot; &quot; lifecode . &quot; &quot; thank you very much .
and then he went to the top-most peak of the greatest mountain of the center of the world called meru .
here &apos;s an example .
but if we &apos;re already invoking aliens in this explanation , then who is to say they didn &apos;t efficiently clean up all this mess for recycling purposes ?
but i do think we &apos;re going to figure it out eventually .
so , a moment .
if there was a dial tone and you dialed a number , the odds were two in three you wouldn &apos;t get the number you were intending to reach .
he is not a political man , but in this guise he has given us the institution for democracy , from where we can rise .
that &apos;s 40 billion dollars a year wasted on electricity that does not contribute to our well-being but does contribute to climate change .
we &apos;ll see what i come up with . thanks for having me .
so there really was no tolerable margin of error .
this is the opposite of what we were built on : independence , self-sufficiency , autonomy .
and as the student video showed , we can impact and move .
you know , you guys are so great , you don &apos;t even know what a connectome is , and you &apos;re willing to play along with me .
metaphorical thinking is essential to how we understand ourselves and others , how we communicate , learn , discover and invent .
and this sort of data explosion available from these is really almost becoming a challenge .
and i think we are not really being honest about that , for so many reasons . it &apos;s so hard to talk about gender .
a brewery is essentially a bioreactor .
and on the bottom-left is a thermal camera .
they have similar sound of eyes .
trying to find a space suit to do this has led me to an area of technology that i never really expected when i set about doing this .
we end up in the situation — we have that scripted life that everybody seems to be living going up this ladder to nowhere .
it &apos;s about your own interpretation and doing something different . &quot; &quot; and i like that .
and with the known physics etc , it &apos;s something actually which has been pointed out by frank drake , many years ago , and shklovsky .
and the second world war was really a terrible event , also economically for japan .
it &apos;s great to let go .
and usually they are accompanied by videos .
the athletes &apos; bodies have gotten much more different from one another .
bringing people , future generations , together through arabic calligraphy is what i do .
it doesn &apos;t mean that at all . it doesn &apos;t ensure it .
dh : could you spread your legs a little bit ?
we know that when it comes to choosing somebody for a job , for an award , we are strongly biased by their race , we are biased by their gender , we are biased by how attractive they are , and sometimes we might say , &quot; &quot; well fine , that &apos;s the way it should be . &quot; &quot; but other times we say , &quot; &quot; this is wrong . &quot; &quot; and so to combat this , we don &apos;t just try harder , but rather what we do is we set up situations where these other sources of information can &apos;t bias us , which is why many orchestras audition musicians behind screens , so the only information they have
what you have here seems to be nothing , but contains an incredible amount of scientific information that helps us explore what makes us human .
mohammed lost both legs during the last week of the conflict .
the fall of the berlin wall would maybe not &#91; have been &#93; there .
he served 24 years for a crime he didn &apos;t commit .
they would offer sweets or money .
so , almost anywhere i went , there they were .
we &apos;re ok , though ? kt : yes .
but the idea has a merit . the idea has a merit .
the amount of energy in each cubic centimeter remains the same , even as the universe gets bigger and bigger .
we &apos;re not doing a great job managing money .
and a little bit later , they were joking around in the kitchen in spanish , that had nothing to do with me , and that is duality .
and so i went back to the united nations .
and it worked .
when those extra three billion people &apos;s identity is mobile , it isn &apos;t fixed ?
the chimps are actually interacting with each other through the computers .
e : what &apos;s the matter ?
but it matters a lot how fast we win it .
so i took another crack at it — you &apos;ve got to keep it moving — and i xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper and i pasted them down on an ugly board .
ernest madu : the lesson in this is that it can be done , and it can be sustained , and you can make it possible for everyone .
moderator : wow . okay , that &apos;s where we are going .
and then when they get old , they haven &apos;t really developed a philosophy of life , but they &apos;ve decided , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve been successful at everything ; i &apos;m just not going to die . &quot; &quot; and so they hire personal trainers ; they &apos;re popping cialis like breath mints .
well let &apos;s take a look at something like autism incidence per thousand .
this may sound a bit kooky to you .
and it also enhances nuclear weapons proliferation .
and this outer layer , this is the vasculature , which is incredible , around a human brain .
but over the centuries , we have constructed on top of this objective reality a second layer of fictional reality , a reality made of fictional entities , like nations , like gods , like money , like corporations .
what are you in america doing about it ?
but i find that with my job , that the rewards far outweigh the risks , and as many risks as i take , my clients take far greater risks , because they have a lot more to lose if their cases go unheard , or worse , if they &apos;re penalized for having me as their lawyer .
so this is not by accident that the voters are not interested to vote anymore .
this is emblematic of it — this is wing dining , recalling those balmy summer days somewhere over france in the 20s , dining on the wing of a plane . you can &apos;t see it very well here , but that &apos;s hemingway reading some pages from his new novel to fitzgerald and ford madox ford until the slipstream blows him away .
was that essential to sort of maintain the quality of what was being built ?
this is the sensory part of the program , people .
it &apos;s a sense of privilege that the natural universe doesn &apos;t share .
this is actually something that one of our engineers , dom , built in a weekend .
it &apos;s no small thing to change a prison system .
i &apos;m not an anthropologist , i have no technical study with the subject , but i do have a very , very , very deep passion , and i believe that i had to choose the most beautiful people on the planet in the most beautiful environment that they lived in , and put the two together and present them to you .
audience : yes .
my sweet angels , come back . &quot; &quot; medea she was , next time i saw her .
you &apos;d all make great blind people . ( laughter ) let &apos;s have a look at what can happen when this activation process is given some time and attention .
and this is called &quot; &quot; the wilderness downtown . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s an online music video for the arcade fire .
and when i got out of my car , the air was pulsing .
well , dickens was right and he was wrong . &#91; correction : rudyard kipling &#93; &#91; kipling &#93; said , &quot; &quot; the colonel &apos;s lady and judy o &apos;grady are sisters underneath the skin . &quot; &quot; ( applause )
we now have a platform .
jason started at darpa on march 18th , 2010 .
so again , we can see that price plays an enormous role in people &apos;s willingness to reduce their driving behavior .
the act of making is a social activity .
&quot; &quot; horizon , &quot; &quot; which takes its cue from the academics , won &apos;t touch it with a barge pole .
the department used to have a process which is very interesting .
and what they &apos;ve realized is that using violence in the situations they operate in is not only less humane , but it &apos;s less effective than using methods that connect people with people , that rebuild .
it wasn &apos;t simple to work in such environments , sometimes having pigs under you while you paint or climbing a stack of garbage to reach a lift .
it was practically everybody .
so the concept here : so if you do have a deceased or injured organ , we take a very small piece of that tissue , less than half the size of a postage stamp .
because most of you compared the price of this big mac to the price you &apos;re used to paying . rather than asking , &quot; &quot; what else can i do with my money , &quot; &quot; comparing this investment to other possible investments , you compared to the past .
be bold . stand up . be fearless . be confident .
and the conclusion was it was tasks that included social-evaluative threat — threats to self-esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance .
in the midst of such widespread uncertainty , we may , in fact , be insecure .
so , eventually , the manufacturers actually arrived at a compromise , which was the combo pack .
around the world , many people began to ask , can we ever stop ebola when it starts to spread like this ?
in recent years , because of global warming , they now cover about 10 percent — an increase by a factor of 25 to 50 .
these are just a few of the ideas that are to die for .
some of them show greater variability .
and they need to think about the substance of their agreement much more than about the labels they want to attach to them .
so the question is , so , why are they all standing there holding books ?
but the religious world doesn &apos;t think that way .
financially , seen over the long term , it was actually successful .
but what if that &apos;s not how we need to buy sneakers either ?
nuclear — there are two bars here .
one of the ranches is called the kirkeby ranch , and i &apos;ll take you there for a minute .
so clearly there was a problem with deforestation .
and that &apos;s the way , ultimately after some ups and downs , i ended up designing the chair i &apos;m going to show you .
well , they signed me up immediately .
my ideal world is a place where no one is left behind , where everyone is needed exactly where they are , like the fibers and the tendons in a bow , a place where the strong is flexible and the vulnerable is resilient .
that implies a lot of trust .
you see , the folks at the ministry of health , the hospital administrators , the doctors , the nurses — they are among just five percent of their peers who get an education after secondary school .
your phone is not very natural .
even if you don &apos;t want to , it &apos;s very difficult numerically .
i mean , that &apos;s a fine logic , that sounds pretty convincing , pretty ironclad , doesn &apos;t it ?
this is the power of nudges when trying to solve complex social problems , and when you do that , you shouldn &apos;t try to tell people how to adapt .
we found that we could discover the causation of the positive states , the relationship between left hemispheric activity and right hemispheric activity , as a cause of happiness .
i wanted to make more of these forests .
this is how to stop a runaway stage .
a well-crafted cyber attack could break into his phone , disable the overvoltage protections on his battery , drastically overload the circuit , cause the battery to overheat , and explode .
so are the pessimists right ?
a lot of my clients are very young .
that &apos;s a problem because they dropped two or three decent items .
this is a tapir .
and unlike the juicy salif , it does not threaten to attach itself to your brain , rather , it simply attaches itself to your brain .
and here &apos;s another example of that interesting cross-pollination between science and art .
we &apos;re only trying to improve our lives .
the earth can support that if we choose the right path .
but i think we &apos;re ignoring certain facts that tell us something about what we can do .
and later on in the night , i woke up because i &apos;m always waking up in the night , and i went by the computer and i see all these red dots , you know , on facebook , which i &apos;ve never seen before .
( laughter ) and what i realized is i needed an expert .
one was ray anderson , who turned — ( applause ) — turned , you know , a part of the evil empire into a zero-footprint , or almost zero-footprint business .
in afghanistan , people go to extraordinary lengths to be able to watch this program .
then we rebuild . then we respect . &quot; &quot; and i burst out in tears , because my father had only just died prior to this journey , and i didn &apos;t ever acknowledge him , i didn &apos;t ever appreciate him for the fact that i &apos;m probably standing here today because of him .
now people have a natural intuition about these trade-offs .
we can &apos;t just focus on identifying the best ; we &apos;ve got to move the rest .
and you know , there &apos;s another adage in hollywood , that nobody knows nothing about anything .
it became a policy of &quot; &quot; positive discrimination , &quot; &quot; we call it now .
but neither of my parents knew this was happening .
so these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .
it &apos;s at the tip of the guadalquivir river .
so , while this space represents someone &apos;s profession , this one certainly represents a passion .
and we commissioned them to make a maquette , or a bust , of benjamin .
candles can &apos;t burn in a vacuum , therefore , probably sparklers wouldn &apos;t either .
now this gets us quickly to the third and final bit for today ; namely , we need to lift our sights , to set our sights on well-being , so that life and health and healthcare can become about making life more wonderful , rather than just less horrible .
we wash the bug out .
hk : i take it as a good sign , because people feel secure in this democracy .
well , at that time — i should go back .
and that ability to get others to want what you want , to get the outcomes you want without coercion or payment , is what i call soft power .
other conditions show people the future self .
( laughter ) man : your father , is he alive ?
additional experiments are going on in other animals that are useful for creating models for human disease , such as monkeys .
this is morina . this is a plant — which i &apos;ve always thought to be rather tedious — named after morin , who was an enterprising french gardener , who issued the first seed catalog in 1621 .
understanding , to me , does not remove the wonder and the joy .
they were tough in the sense that , as i grew up , both my mother and father would always say to me , it &apos;s really important that you always remember two things .
if you hold it too tightly , you crush it .
but it &apos;s the living room .
that &apos;s , in the additive , about 25 percent of our problem .
at home it sounds kind of anticlimactic .
with much greater humility , he knocks again on the door .
here is here , and out there is out there . okay ?
and there are a number of schemes , which i don &apos;t want to dwell on , but this is the one that we finally used where we projected onto rear screen material that was molded in the face — literally in the face of the person .
let us therefore go to battle stations , not to fight each other , but to begin deflecting these incoming asteroids .
the last 20 years has been the age of intervention , and afghanistan is simply one act in a five-act tragedy .
it &apos;s to have a look at different worlds .
it &apos;s really good . it starts with &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; and goes to &quot; &quot; aw . &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; is high , the &quot; &quot; aw &quot; &quot; is low .
because of data .
here &apos;s another example .
i &apos;ve been lucky enough to answer some of these questions as i &apos;ve explored this nocturnal world .
so figuring out all these relationships with relative and absolute location , distance , timing , velocities — that &apos;s really the key to the science of moving dots , or as we like to call it , spatiotemporal pattern recognition , in academic vernacular .
it should not be . until one of my colleagues said , &quot; &quot; it looks to me like a thermal blister , and the mid-ocean ridge must be a cooling curve . &quot; &quot; we said , &quot; &quot; let &apos;s go find out . &quot; &quot; we punched a bunch of heat probes . everything made sense , except , at the axis , there was missing heat . it was missing heat .
well , more idea creators .
( laughter ) ( applause ) brought in more women .
but this , i show you , when kids from the poorest congressional district in america can build a 30-foot by 15-foot wall , design it , plant it and install it in the heart of new york city , that &apos;s a true &quot; &quot; sí se puede &quot; &quot; moment .
it &apos;s real slavery in exactly the same way that slavery would be recognized throughout all of human history .
you know , reputations are built on trust , consistency , transparency .
so now it &apos;s able to train with just this little piece on the back .
now you &apos;ve probably seen pictures of neurons before .
in the 1980s , i developed an underwater keyboard .
the entire project is predicated on this act of love which is listening itself .
we took the english story and translated it to russian .
we &apos;ve got the fox watching the henhouse here .
if there &apos;s an achilles &apos; heel in one our projects , we want to know it now , up front , not way down the road .
half the children in this classroom have no parents because they &apos;ve died through aids .
whether it &apos;s in sierra leone or in boston , i hope this not only restores but indeed transforms their sense of human potential .
but some of them spend a lot of time in the sand , making mountains and seas — well , not seas , but different things — people and dogs , etc .
like those chloroplast cells — they &apos;re completely surrounded by other life .
where does it stop ?
( applause )
i &apos;ve been eating cereal for breakfast all of my life .
so low income here , high income there .
it &apos;s the autobiographical self which some species have , i think .
so to me , this was just so bizarre about how they could get the packaging so mysteriously beautiful and perfect and the message so unbearably , clearly wrong .
so it was true .
and stop where you want .
through back and forth conversations , they increase the resilience of the whole community .
how many people here have heard of pms ?
it &apos;s only a problem now when the chocolate is next to us .
i worked on a film called &quot; &quot; apollo 13 , &quot; &quot; and when i worked on this film , i discovered something about how our brains work , and how our brains work is that , when we &apos;re sort of infused with either enthusiasm or awe or fondness or whatever , it changes and alters our perception of things .
that was the question we wanted to know , so my colleagues and i decided to take a deep dive into the data .
anyway , i felt that it was important that you didn &apos;t have to make an adjustment in order to get this kind of action .
they blamed the leader of the opposition for not fighting it hard enough .
now it &apos;s a little bit less than 30 percent .
and so , she really just completely ignored me most of the time .
and i &apos;m working at all the energy i have to sort of communicate this message that we need preschool , we need head start , we need prenatal care .
( laughter ) ka : by being totally surprising and humorous , casey niestat got his funny idea and point seen five million times .
well , it &apos;s not going to come as any surprise for me to tell you that banks accept dirty money , but they prioritize their profits in other destructive ways too .
we developed leonardo in collaboration with stan winston studio .
but i did come to embrace this new identity , and in many ways i think of myself now as african .
and the technology we have developed — it &apos;s called sim ofdm .
on a business trip to florida in the early 1980s , bonica got a former student to drive him to the hyde park area in tampa .
it &apos;s really about designing from the inside out .
we wanted to be the only political party with no particular political leaning .
and i was in the states at the time , and they called me . he was very sick , the first time he got sick .
( applause )
they inhabit the trees at all body sizes , and , of course , they inhabit the land .
what are they going to think when we actually form a colony on mars ?
it &apos;s true .
the more output you churn out , the more variety you get and the better your chances of stumbling on something truly original .
all of this is a variation of the if-then model .
and i believe that magic and puzzles are the same because they both key into one of the most important human drives : the urge to solve .
( laughter ) it will look something like this . ( laughter )
i wanted people to ask me about my experiences .
you are going to hit the ground .
you know viennese audiences usually don &apos;t interfere with the music .
instead , get rid of the school bell .
there , it &apos;s nothing more than a gurgle of water that issues forth from beneath a rock in a boulder in a pasture , high in the bitterroot mountains .
these are scottish terriers .
he really wants that sargassum .
teacher : well done . very good ...
now , already in the case of the brain disorders that i &apos;ve been talking to you about , depression , obsessive compulsive disorder , post-traumatic stress disorder , while we don &apos;t have an in-depth understanding of how they are abnormally processed or what the brain is doing in these illnesses , we have been able to already identify some of the connectional differences , or some of the ways in which the circuitry is different for people who have these disorders .
a lot of urban areas have been converted into parking lots in a sort of indiscriminate use .
to be able to change fences and window guards into flowers , it &apos;s fantastic .
so these all have the property of self-similarity : the part looks like the whole .
but it &apos;s not like that everywhere .
and that would take care of your problem , and that would provide the solution for you . &quot; &quot; so i immediately jumped in my car , went downtown , saw the trailer — it was a small trailer , but under the circumstances , i figured that was the best thing that i could do .
i remember my father receiving anonymous letters saying , &quot; &quot; your daughter is spreading western culture in the honorable societies . &quot; &quot; our car was stoned at one point .
think about it : in 2013 , the second decade of the millennium , if you &apos;re concerned about a cancer diagnosis and you go to your doctor , you get bone scans , biopsies and blood tests .
because egyptians are more optimistic than they have been in years , far less divided on religious-secular lines than we would think and poised for the demands of democracy .
the first thing i &apos;m going to show you is a change between age three and five , as kids learn to understand that somebody else can have beliefs that are different from their own .
now , it turns out that the more egalitarian our relationships , the happier both partners are .
it &apos;s analyzing trends . it &apos;s predicting the future .
it &apos;s quite hard , actually , to get those very small changes .
i don &apos;t need to know that at the end of the year when it &apos;s too late .
they &apos;re absolutely everywhere .
and then what happened ?
and this is how it works : patent holders , inventors that develop new medicines patent those inventions , but make those patents available to the medicines patent pool . the medicines patent pool then license those out to whoever needs access to those patents .
these are cane toads in australia .
because the personal , as you know , is political .
it &apos;s almost more important than their eyesight .
well , this is another trend in the field .
it uses x-rays , x-ray beams , that are rotating very fast around the human body .
this is not the stomping ground of our pleistocene ancestors .
it was like a star trek episode , you know ?
now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us , but we can admire the institutional way in which they &apos;re doing it .
let &apos;s look at spam .
it was , &quot; &quot; why are you doing the work that you &apos;re doing ? &quot; &quot; and so often their answer would be , &quot; well , because somebody told me i &apos;m supposed to . &quot;
and the concept is to create a kind of onion , a kind of structure in layers .
that machine doesn &apos;t care about the environment , about racism , about all these issues that make this life worse for all of us , and so the government does have a role to take resources from more productive uses , or from richer sources , and give them to other sources .
and then here &apos;s senegal — it &apos;s got a higher level of social progress than chad , but the same level of gdp .
so , visualizing information can give us a very quick solution to those kinds of problems .
we &apos;re going to do that very soon .
( laughter ) now it &apos;s just the way it is .
so that &apos;s where we are today , and that &apos;s what i wanted to give you a flavor of .
so you have less waste , and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign as it is with cow dung .
and for the past 23 years , at an increasing rate , we &apos;ve been pouring more and more ideas and capabilities and so on into mathematica , and i &apos;m happy to say that that &apos;s led to many good things in r &amp; d and education , lots of other areas .
( laughter ) but we don &apos;t have gta because , maybe it &apos;s my own reflection , i &apos;ve never been able to do anything but crashing cars and shooting prostitutes and pimps .
i think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time , thereby conserving mating time and energy .
what made me do it ? at school , i will admit this : academically , i couldn &apos;t express myself .
and of that stuff , what do you actually use ?
it never happened .
so close your eyes for a minute .
it goes down to 15 degrees centigrade from 35 , and comes out of this perfectly fine .
much of my life has been a quest to get some answers to these questions .
there were markets in africa before the colonialists stepped foot on the continent .
three days later , after everybody has left the home , my mom went and brought a nurse .
thank you .
11-year-olds cannot do simple addition , they cannot construct a grammatically correct sentence .
i started building this project when i was about 12 or 13 years old .
he says , &quot; &quot; i feel bad about the polar bears .
of course , they covered that with make-up , because lara croft did all those same stunts — but she doesn &apos;t get black and blue , because she has sprezzatura .
this little guy is called the kinesin , and he pulls a sack that &apos;s full of brand new manufactured proteins to wherever it &apos;s needed in the cell — whether it &apos;s to a membrane , whether it &apos;s to an organelle , whether it &apos;s to build something or repair something .
so there &apos;s a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic and that analogy is the electric industry .
but to me , they are fascinating objects to visually narrate a story .
and one of the most tedious ones , i think , was saying that beauty was about symmetry .
and even if they were able to do so , even if i &apos;m wrong , it &apos;s extremely unlikely the taliban would invite back al-qaeda .
and i think if we can do that , we might be able to fundamentally change not only human beings &apos; sense of their own agency and power — because i think that &apos;s the most wonderful thing about new power , is that people feel more powerful — but we might also be able to change the way we relate to each other and the way we relate to authority and institutions .
give us a few pages out of your playbook about what someone who is inspired about their city can do to take on projects like yours ?
and so , like many people , we start with a house on a lot , and i &apos;m going to show you a typical construction on the top and what we &apos;re doing on the bottom .
they &apos;ve never been dived . &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; yeah .
what glamour is all about — i took this from a blurb in the table of contents of new york magazine , which was telling us that glamour is back — glamour is all about transcending the everyday .
and there &apos;s opportunities in a circular economy .
and then as you enter it again , looking in all directions towards the city .
for example , xcl technologies , they developed two of the mission critical systems for the new boeing 787 dreamliner , one to avoid collisions in the sky , and another to allow landing in zero visibility .
i believe that everyday soundscape can be the most unexpected inspiration for songwriting , and to look at this idea a little bit more closely , i &apos;m going to talk today about three things : nature , language and silence — or rather , the impossibility of true silence .
and it has led me to think that perhaps these questions are the ones that propel people to cross the line , and that some affairs are an attempt to beat back deadness , in an antidote to death .
there have actually been 22 species of hominids that have been around , have evolved , have wandered in different places , have gone extinct .
the battle against corruption exacts a toll on ourselves , our families , our friends , and even our kids .
it &apos;s not , perhaps , the dimensions appreciated by art critics or architecture critics or city planners .
thank you .
this is the disney hall — the concert hall .
and i was particularly fascinated with sharks .
the civil defense programs were disconnected from the reality of what we &apos;d see in all-out nuclear war .
i don &apos;t know , and i should .
the average boy now watches 50 porn video clips a week .
we &apos;re about to ride the wave of technological opportunity .
or that we require kids to sit still too much , and so boys initially feel like failures ?
and so this is after a day and about half a night smelting this iron .
today , these roads that interconnect our world are dominated by cars and trucks that have remained largely unchanged for 100 years .
but here &apos;s the thing : we are the only advanced civilization in the solar system , but that doesn &apos;t mean that there is no microbial life nearby .
we are here to dream together .
now to some , this was an audacious goal , because our school is located in the brownsville section of brooklyn — one of the most underserved and violent neighborhoods in all of new york city .
a recent study in the archives of surgery reported surgeons removing healthy ovaries , operating on the wrong side of the brain , carrying out procedures on the wrong hand , elbow , eye , foot , and also mistakes born out of thinking errors .
obviously , it &apos;s difficult to calculate .
the first one was actually two hours .
( applause ) can we cue the music please ? ( applause )
so , as a bottom-of-the-rung architecture graduate , i might expect to earn about 24,000 pounds .
this is a facility dedicated to the next generation of aviation fuels using halophytes .
why the need for accumulating money , then doing philanthropy ?
what we &apos;ve found is a whole range of new viruses in these individuals , including new viruses in the same group as hiv — so , brand new retroviruses .
i only need two things .
this is in 1960 .
it all comes back to those ones and zeros .
but the real secret i think lies more in the way that they organize their society .
today , i don &apos;t write the translation of the message anymore on the wall .
that &apos;s what art is for .
this is systemic causation .
now you look at a master &apos;s student , a little further along in their education , and you see they know a bit more , but it &apos;s been narrowed somewhat .
so , what is to be done ?
and it ends like this : &quot; &quot; this telegraph is a fantastic instrument to diffuse religion , civilization , liberty and law throughout the world . &quot; &quot; those are nice words . but i got sort of curious of what he meant with liberty , and liberty for whom .
i found these little bits of glass .
charlie : not in my book , it isn &apos;t .
lotte reiniger , an amazing shadow puppeteer in the 20s , that started doing more elaborate things .
we collect data on animal populations , analyze complex patterns , try to explain them .
lewis , have the courage to go in there , because we are going to look after you every moment of it . &quot; &quot; and i just , i got so much confidence from him saying that , because he knew me so well .
india , the largest democracy in the world , 94 and dropping .
greenpeace and other organizations put that number in the tens of thousands .
devices like this will bring 3d holographic content right into our world , enhancing the way we experience life beyond our ordinary range of perceptions .
we never succeeded in using ten fingers , but there are certain things you can do , obviously , with more than one-finger input , which is rather fascinating .
last i heard we had 93 percent accepted to college .
then we could all be engaged in helping .
my goal is to be able to travel and do things that are simple to you .
it &apos;s clear that multilateral cooperation is essential .
this is the former trolley terminal that was the depot for passengers traveling over the williamsburg bridge from brooklyn to manhattan , and it was open between 1908 and 1948 , just around the time when my grandparents were living right in the area .
and i have one right here .
introduction of red down here , when whales are being cut up .
age is another thing when our attitude toward our appearance changes .
and according to that theory , it &apos;s already too late to avoid a disaster , because if it &apos;s true that our best option at the moment is to prevent co2 emissions with something like the kyoto protocol , with its constraints on economic activity and its enormous cost of hundreds of billions of dollars , or whatever it is , then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure .
now i eat whenever i &apos;m hungry , and i &apos;ve lost 10 pounds .
then in early 2007 , a really interesting thing happened .
you see that enough in the media .
so kids don &apos;t have as hard of a time with this , and i saw in my own son , i gave him this book .
now in a sense , when we think about the effect of video games on the brain , it &apos;s very similar to the effect of wine on the health .
it &apos;s an accelerated view , where you can see the robot actually carrying out some of its replication process .
we know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like .
paint is all low-volume chemical , which is very important when you &apos;re working in the room all the time .
i had a bit of an epiphany being lost in pennsylvania , and i took a left turn trying to get back to the highway .
when we have a bad idea , the response to a bad idea is not no ideas , it &apos;s not to stop thinking .
a person can come in and take somebody else &apos;s gown , cut off three inches from the bottom , go to the e.u. and register it as a new , original design .
ka : obviously , what you faced in trying to do something as substantial as this project — and this is only one of four that you &apos;ve designed to surround the site — you must have run up against the incredibly byzantine , entrenched bureaucracy and powers that be in new york real estate and new york politics .
i &apos;m being told which part of the stick to use .
there &apos;s the solar panels of the cell , some switches that turn your genes on and off , the girders of the cell , motors that move your muscles .
out of that empathy , he spun a whole new field , played a major role in getting medicine to acknowledge pain in and of itself .
when the participants arrived for their interview , i offered them a set of drinks : coke , diet coke , sprite — seven , to be exact .
on the other , every time you turned to your phone , there is this deluge of insults .
it wasn &apos;t the resume of breaking this record here , it was more like , who had i become ?
and there was a project with , funded by the national science foundation — sent a bunch of scanners , and the american libraries were supposed to send books .
i know i should mention : i &apos;m making all these things .
is it just the wind or a dangerous predator ?
we see this in the public sector as well .
( laughter ) we tore everything down and buried it in his backyard .
it lives in our oceans and in freshwater ponds .
( applause ) in my very last example — i do a lot of my work using speech recognition software .
now failure to produce enough insulin is incompatible with life .
it challenges the norms .
if we perceive it in this way as a brand , or other ways of thinking at it like this , we will not resolve or counter terrorism .
that &apos;s where dinosaur origins is to be found : at the bottom of the cliff .
this is a more interesting one where half faces were shown to some people , and then to add them into a list of most beautiful to least beautiful and then exposing a full face .
thank you very much . ( applause )
for reference , fact one : exxon &apos;s revenues in 2005 were a billion dollars a day .
but now you &apos;ve got this virus in there , and we don &apos;t know what the long-term effects of that are .
so where do we go now ?
sighted astronomers depend on this kind of plot in order to interpret how this light intensity changes over time .
and again , closely related to inequality .
they all bitched about each other . i mean , quite gossipy , those cables . okay , but i thought it was a very important point for all of us to grasp , these are human beings just like us . they don &apos;t have special powers .
so what we really want to focus on is the long-run evolution of wealth inequality , and what &apos;s going to happen in the future .
and it is always extraordinary to see a thing of beauty .
so , good things come out of , you know , incomprehension — ( laughter ) — which i will do a painting of , and then it will end up in my work .
so if you were there 3.3 million years ago , to hear when this girl was crying out for her mother , she would have sounded more like a chimpanzee than a human .
umar also has polio .
and so , we wanted to know , how green could we be ?
didn &apos;t know how on earth i &apos;d ever pass a medical .
it was sensitive , we had to go up the chain of command , convince them that this was the right thing to do and do all of this on electronic medium .
i have to say , this sounds awesome . ( laughter ) i could totally have used this 10 minutes ago .
so that &apos;s where we stand at the moment , and i &apos;ve just got a few final thoughts , which is that this is another way in which biology is now coming in to supplement chemistry in some of our societal advances in this area , and these biological approaches are coming in in very different forms , and when you think about genetic engineering , we &apos;ve now got enzymes for industrial processing , enzymes , genetically engineered enzymes in food .
so she &apos;s even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn &apos;t stupid , even though she thought she could look stupid .
we &apos;re not the only ones .
this is the result of my hobby , which is unofficial bin inspections . ( laughter ) strange you might think , but if we could rely on corporations to tell us what they were doing in the back of their stores , we wouldn &apos;t need to go sneaking around the back , opening up bins and having a look at what &apos;s inside .
sp : the imprisonment of nonviolent drug offenders and the toleration of rape in our nation &apos;s prisons .
and that is me , going to , hurrying to uganda , to try to save that 4,000 material , with people carrying them on the bikes , bicycles .
this is autumn 1989 , and imagine that all those people standing up and protesting for change had a mobile phone in their pocket .
it &apos;s a free swimming shark with a satellite tag jumping after salmon , sending home its data .
so where does this leave us ?
so , about three years ago i was in london , and somebody called howard burton came to me and said , i represent a group of people , and we want to start an institute in theoretical physics .
i would argue , only government is capable of creating these necessary conditions for economies to thrive .
and the acoustic habitat of the north atlantic right whale has been reduced by up to 90 percent .
so , basically in 2002 there were 1,200 dancing bears .
this is a black coral called leiopathes , an image taken by my colleague , brendan roark , about 500 meters below hawaii .
but , in fact , you can start , even though we haven &apos;t trained this neocortical column to create a specific reality .
they claim to be psychics , or sensitives , whatever they can .
but we &apos;ve got an opportunity to recycle them into something more useful that enables us to get energy all of the time .
well , suffice it to say it &apos;s not all like that , but that &apos;s part of it .
ca : what , to power — for lighting and stuff ?
i love my mother , but she thought i was wasting my life with this museum stuff .
and i &apos;m sure buckminster fuller would be very , very proud to see a bamboo geodesic dome .
but it &apos;s an animal that &apos;s about 98 percent in decline throughout most of its range .
and today , less than five years in , kiva &apos;s facilitated more than 150 million dollars , in little 25-dollar bits , from lenders and entrepreneurs — more than a million of those , collectively in 200 countries .
it &apos;s not the same thing as good , better and best .
he felt it . he lived it .
i was past 40 when my father died .
they &apos;re big , hot planets that are easy to see .
the managers and the security guards , on the other hand , did not find it particularly funny .
what we need to do is to use our ingenuity and our scientific knowledge to try to design a new generation of treatments that are targeted to specific neurons and specific regions of the brain that are affected in particular psychiatric disorders .
we &apos;ve only just begun to analyze all of this data .
so we took a drug that is already known and by just delivering it locally where it &apos;s needed the most , we allow a response that is 12 times more powerful , reducing the systemic toxic effect .
it &apos;s sort of called a meta-motivational theory about how we look , a theory about motivation and the mood we &apos;re in and how the mood we &apos;re in determines the things we like or dislike .
what it means is all the guys were lying about their height .
and the chinese then , in one of their periods of media openness , decided that they were going to let it go , that they were going to let this citizen reporting fly .
and we wanted to push the idea of the music video that was meant for the web beyond the four-by-three or sixteen-by-nine window and try to make it play out and choreograph throughout the screen .
and how big a problem is this ?
it makes for an exotic and chilly commute .
the final project i &apos;ll talk about is one that &apos;s very close to my heart , and it involves an economic and social value that is associated with epiphytic plants .
but what if we get it right ?
and that &apos;s why helium &apos;s called helium .
it &apos;s usually presided over by religious leaders and village elders , and jirgas are often used in rural countries like afghanistan , where there &apos;s deep-seated resentment against the formal system .
at the lower end of the scale , you find a rigid sequence , a sequence of all a &apos;s , and you also find a computer program , in this case in the language fortran , which obeys really strict rules .
now think about it . this is an amazing thing : that in this frequency range where whales communicate , the main source globally , on our planet , for the noise comes from human ships , thousands of human ships , distant , far away , just all aggregating .
pigs have dna .
so if this is now , and that &apos;s the past , and we start thinking about change , you know , all governments are seeking change , you &apos;re here seeking change , everybody &apos;s after change , it &apos;s really cool . ( laughter ) so what happens is , we get this wonderful whooshing acceleration and change .
if they don &apos;t know , who are the people trying to influence the decision , how much clout do they have , how much they care about this issue , and what do they say they want , are they experts ? that &apos;s what it means to be an expert , that &apos;s the basic stuff an expert needs to know .
and the thing that &apos;s so unique about our species is that we &apos;re really designed to play through our whole lifetime .
so when i came back there , i found these two kids , eight- and 12-year-olds , who were playing a game on the computer .
we &apos;ll go into areas we have no knowledge of .
so what we did is we took all the books — we just ordered them by time — for each book we take the words and we project them to the space , and then we ask for each word how close it is to introspection , and we just average that .
based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness , cognitive behavioral therapy , &#91; very &#93; strong for our well being .
it &apos;s practiced , it &apos;s no anesthesia , it &apos;s a rusty old knife , and it was difficult .
corals are born in a number of different ways , but most often by mass spawning : all of the individuals of a single species on one night a year , releasing all the eggs they &apos;ve made that year into the water column , packaged into bundles with sperm cells .
the third step , following the second step , is to create new mental habits .
lp : yeah , absolutely .
in germany , they made one small change without checking with me — nor did they have to , because it was done through agencies — but see if you can tell the difference .
how do we know that all those graphs , all that progress , is enough to solve what you showed in the first part ?
take a look at this plant .
so this is the end of a ph.d. project from one of the best robotics institutes .
why did it fail miserably ?
sometimes , you get disease organisms that don &apos;t rely on host mobility at all for transmission .
here &apos;s a slide of the first 1,000 digits of this prime .
it &apos;s now home to alma , the large telescope that &apos;s being developed there .
she argued and argued , and finally she struck lucky when a researcher came through town studying the history of mines in the area , and she told him her story , and at first , of course , like everyone , he didn &apos;t believe her , but he went back to seattle and he did his own research and he realized that she was right .
it &apos;s a very logical plan , but it was not always like this .
with a brain the size of a peanut , they maintain individualized , long-term social bonds , we didn &apos;t know that was possible .
empathy and respect . empathy and respect .
most of us got put in front of a disciplinary council , and were rejected from the communities that we loved because we wanted to make them better , because we believed that they could be .
as susan cain said in her &quot; &quot; quiet &quot; &quot; book , in a chapter that featured the strange canadian professor who was teaching at the time at harvard , i sometimes go to the men &apos;s room to escape the slings and arrows of outrageous extroverts .
he suspected an outbreak that concentrated would probably involve a single point source .
let &apos;s first at least decide what is it we &apos;re trying to achieve . &quot; &quot; so with a lot of push and pull and debate , haryana set itself a goal which said : by 2020 , we want 80 percent of our children to be at grade-level knowledge .
and that rover will be more kind of like a chemist .
we also think that individuals can make a difference , and they should , because individuals , together , we can all help create a movement .
aging : the problem is enormous , 300,000 broken hips per year ; but the solutions are extraordinary , and they include so many different things .
we &apos;ve been asking it here at ted already .
so governments who are failing , who are dropping the ball at a national level , have even less ability to get their arms around the problem at an international level .
that &apos;s understandable and important .
and you can see an image produced by this consortium .
and we &apos;ve reached that time . we cannot afford to underestimate this problem . if we face irreversible and catastrophic consequences , we must act , and we must act decisively .
soldiers have a name for these clips .
doaa was sitting with her legs crammed up to her chest , bassem holding her hand .
there are political food fights .
take the first step , as soon as life appeared on this earth .
it &apos;s the best return on investment they ever received . ( laughter ) ca : and the best news of all , i guess , is this .
it has to decide whether to turn around and stay in the same odor , or whether to cross the midline and try something new .
let &apos;s put it that way .
and i &apos;ve put the formula up there .
but as far as we know , we &apos;re the only upright-walking ape that exists on planet earth today , except for the bonobos .
so if the world is not as it seems and we see things as we are , then what we call reality is a kind of hallucination happening inside here . it &apos;s a waking dream , and understanding that that is what we actually exist in is one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history .
( applause )
in chapter seven , i focus on the effects of a genocidal act on one bloodline .
and an interesting thing happened : the jacques cousteau shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on earth .
it &apos;s a perfect world .
they only know the moments that make up their story , even when the book is closed .
my seduction into the world of fireflies began when i was back in graduate school .
teacher : do not pay any attention to what anybody else is doing .
in san ramon , california , they published an iphone app in which they allow you or me to say we are certified cpr-trained , and then when someone has a heart attack , a notification goes out so that you can rush over to the person over here and deliver cpr .
we were all scared and confused .
for starters , there are two things we can all do .
however , there is an underlying argument about logistics , which has driven so much of this debate . right ?
that &apos;s a huge problem .
do you live in a more walkable city or do you live in a less walkable city , or where in your city do you live ?
and now libya as you see it .
but our multitasking reality is pretty different , and full of tons of information .
the rest of us are meant to feel like amateurs in the sense of suckers .
and everybody &apos;s a narrator , because everybody has a story to tell .
now , i am going to show you how my bow works .
and the way i think about this is that healthcare is like any other system .
it started as a means of self-expression .
so it &apos;s not obvious how it leads to inflation in the country doing the actual printing unless it leads to a currency depreciation of that country .
in a region famous for the soft , porous loess plateau soil , there lived until recently an estimated 40 million people in these houses underground .
maybe you want to invest in a stock market of things .
then you &apos;re going to paste them where it makes sense for you to place your own statement .
so what &apos;s goliath ? he &apos;s heavy infantry , and his expectation when he challenges the israelites to a duel is that he &apos;s going to be fighting another heavy infantryman .
in a nutshell , that &apos;s what i was trying to do with these things , but more importantly , that &apos;s what the past 30 years of music has been .
there &apos;s something terrible happening . &quot; &quot; and she said , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t be so silly . &quot; &quot; and i started to cry .
so when i was eight years old , a new girl came to join the class , and she was so impressive , as the new girl always seems to be .
but what might feel just right for that middle-aged executive can be a problem for an adolescent who needs to develop face-to-face relationships .
lassa virus is a lot like ebola .
not the kind of librarian that takes her glasses off , lets her hair down , suddenly she &apos;s smoking hot .
and i cut it into smaller questions , and i have the answer to these smaller questions .
( music : &quot; &quot; flight of the bumblebee &quot; &quot; ) ao : or another one ? how about in g minor ?
salman rushdie was pissed-off i think because i altered the map of new york , if you notice .
in sweden we read it once and then we went partying .
those half of you , roughly , who are women , at some point may have had a pregnancy test .
you can see the lgbt community is not really getting along with the geek community that well , the arts community , the music community .
and i did everything i could to spend my time , every waking hour possible trying to hound these guys , hanging out and having beers and workouts , whatever it was .
so , this is an example of a device made from a simple piece of paper .
rb : well , i like to think it stands for quality , that you know , if somebody comes across a virgin company , they — ca : they are quality , richard . come on now , everyone says quality . spirit ?
so he got volunteers to go move to cuba and live in tents and be voluntarily infected with yellow fever .
and you can see the red dots , in this particular patient &apos;s case , were finger sticks , which would have missed both ends .
i had so many examples — i have so many instances like this , when i &apos;m writing a story , and i cannot explain it .
and i think that &apos;s a really damaging and dangerous narrative that we have , that allows these types of things to happen , as the general public just kind of turns a blind eye to it .
so i &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; cool . i can do whatever the hell i want , since it &apos;s my responsibility and i gotta maintain it . &quot; &quot; and this is how i decided to maintain it .
( laughter ) i &apos;m also a software engineer , and i make lots of different kinds of art with the computer .
here &apos;s the thing : everybody loves a beautiful baby .
so what you &apos;re seeing on the left is a touch device .
what would be your reason ?
i now decide where i &apos;m going to be in that space , so i &apos;m down on this small part of the bottom rib of the letter &quot; &quot; e , &quot; &quot; and i &apos;m thinking about it , and i &apos;m imagining this space that &apos;s really high and above . if i asked you to reach out — you don &apos;t have to literally do it , but in mind — reach out to the top of the &quot; &quot; e , &quot; &quot; where would you reach ?
they have to be able to act along with their fellow actors in the production .
they &apos;re not very animated . ( laughter ) this was the fourth take , i &apos;m told . ( laughter ) okay . so , as we &apos;re talking about cambridge , let &apos;s now move on to technical advancements , because since we started putting this technology on mobile phones less than 12 months ago , the speed and the processing in these devices has grown at a really phenomenal rate , and that means that i can now take cinema-quality 3d models and place them in the world around me , so i have one over here .
so breaking things back down and delivering smartly , elegantly , sophisticated solutions that take into consideration the entire system and the entire life of the thing , everything , all the way back to the extraction through to the end of life , we can start to actually find really innovative solutions .
he was in some sort of catatonic state where he could be aware of his surroundings , but couldn &apos;t even blink to indicate that he was alive .
but i don &apos;t believe in hope without endeavor .
it was a very , very terrifying situation .
and because of that , as grain changes hands — and i &apos;ve measured that it changes hands four , five times in its trajectory from the farmer to the consumer — every time it changes hands — and i &apos;ve seen this all over rural africa — it also changes sacks .
so these two devices , drivegrip and speedstrip , are very effective .
in fact , when i know the data that &apos;s being shared and i &apos;m asked explicitly for my consent , i want some sites to understand my habits .
so i just put the paper on the focal length , which was an etching print , then i got the portrait of &#91; the &#93; sun from sunlight .
my lab started working on this , and i want to show you the result .
i &apos;ve lost count of how many times people of all sizes have told me that the show has changed their lives , how it helped them shift their relationship to their own and other people &apos;s bodies , and how it made them confront their own bias .
and also , one year , the g3 bondi blue thing — that caddy would come out , like , dangerous , like , &quot; &quot; whack , &quot; &quot; like that .
it &apos;s an extraordinary change .
or it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be .
today &apos;s cybercriminal , what do they look like ?
so , all we would need to do is to fit a small microchip to every potential illumination device .
when we look at a map of los angeles or london , it is hard to believe that as of 2005 , only 15 percent of the world was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail .
nowhere in the world do women earn the same as men .
it &apos;s almost like ...
and some things look very familiar today .
in other words , we have possibly stumbled upon the holy grail of modern day planetary exploration , or in other words , an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms .
egos , systems of government — figuring it out — massive change .
in the tool that we &apos;ve built , what we did was we collected 1.5 million cases from all around the united states , from cities , from counties , from every single state in the country , the federal districts .
bogota , where mayor mockus , when he was mayor , he introduced a transportation system that saved energy , that allowed surface buses to run in effect like subways , express buses with corridors .
people have created and invested millions of dollars into non-profit organizations with the mission of helping people who are poor .
&quot; &quot; i don &apos;t know . you know ?
by 2010 , college graduates , if you said two circles followed by a semicircle , two sixteens followed by what , they would say eight , because eight is half of 16 .
he was clearly embarrassed .
we object to genetically engineered food .
ok . now . if something absorbs the energy , the electron can travel .
the name is a misnomer .
what happens is , they burn into flash memory the software , and then test them for a few hours .
and a small indulgence , like eating one scoop of ice cream , is more likely to lead to a food binge in controlled eaters .
and essentially , the story is this with right whales , that about a million years ago , there was one species of right whale on the planet , but as land masses moved around and oceans became isolated , the species sort of separated , and today we have essentially two distinct stocks .
ca : just between us . ( laughter ) em : i made that bet , i think , two or three years ago , so in roughly 18 years , i think we &apos;ll see more power from solar than any other source .
with all these things i &apos;ve been learning about the food system , it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer , or we can pay the hospital .
these are the faces of the children that i have tested with stories just like justin .
and there &apos;s some younger clones dotting the landscape behind it .
milo : what do they want to come here for anyway ?
now my adviser &apos;s concern was what if the penile wall tissue is just the same as any other hydrostatic skeleton .
and before you know it , any social cause can be actually financed in this way .
but long term — i didn &apos;t mean that .
has a direct effect on what happens in my country — as we in london saw in the 7 / 7 bombings .
the director of sports who &apos;s responsible for getting her into the program asks her to come out of class .
i &apos;m not sure what it was . might have been gas .
our boat crashing onto the rocks , i slipped into the water and destroyed my camera , whatever i had documented .
but it did lead to newton discovering gravity .
you may remember that we were talking about a super-massive star that became a very strong magnetic field magnetar .
if you want to find the big new ideas , it &apos;s often difficult to find them in mainstream markets , in big organizations .
and while it &apos;s growing , all these literal transformations are taking place .
one reason is they are always comparing india with china .
it has photonic crystals on its surface , according to people who studied it , which are extremely sophisticated crystals .
and the next year it shipped running on something new called an apple ii personal computer .
but each bag we &apos;d sell would provide a year &apos;s worth of school meals for one kid .
when i was about three or four years old , i remember my mum reading a story to me and my two big brothers , and i remember putting up my hands to feel the page of the book , to feel the picture they were discussing .
and now they &apos;re all in here .
robust systems are also fault tolerant and fail-safe .
the year after it was finished in 2004 , you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months .
that &apos;s not the novel part .
it &apos;s called cannonau .
once you start cutting things in half , you kind of get carried away , so you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan .
we &apos;re awfully careful in the lab to try and avoid various biohazards .
the membrane is translucent .
we back so far up we &apos;re finally seeing a containment around us — the afterglow of the big bang .
and this is a static culture .
for example , the one on the left here allows me to add a little bit of reverb to my sound , which gives me that — ( trumpet ) — flavor .
as you know , an animation is a series of images .
we went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on .
i have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation .
( laughter ) which just resulted in a fantastic photograph . ( laughter )
the students were just scared : scared to sit in rows in fear that something would happen ; scared because they were often teased in the cafeteria for eating free food .
it &apos;s like , why didn &apos;t i follow up on that ?
and this is a picture of hong ngu , vietnam today .
one woman i talked to , who also told a joke that landed badly , she stayed home for a year and a half .
there &apos;s something sacred about a space where you can work on a project , and you don &apos;t have to justify to anyone that it &apos;s going to make a lot of money , that it &apos;s going to save mankind , or even that it &apos;s feasible .
the real trouble comes when pregnant women are , in a sense , unreliable narrators , when fetuses are led to expect a world of scarcity and are born instead into a world of plenty .
it turns out , it &apos;s hopeful . it &apos;s hopeful .
but sometimes i try to put myself in an evil man &apos;s position .
obviously a really profound moment , and it changed our lives in many ways .
and there were lots of widows and orphans , people like that , who needed a foster home .
so , i like to use them .
well , this happens to be the most important painting we have in italy by leonardo da vinci , and look at the wonderful images of faces that nobody has seen for five centuries . look at these portraits .
in the decades to come , 75 percent of the world &apos;s population will live in cities , and 50 of those cities will be of 10 million people or more .
we can use technology for transparency , and many other things .
if some of you play chess , you &apos;ll know that 64 is a square number , and that &apos;s why chessboards , eight by eight , have 64 squares .
and now , together , what we can see on this ocean of color that &apos;s temperature , we can see ten-day worms of makos and salmon sharks .
and the last suggestion i have is that , if you do have a meeting coming up , if you have the power , just cancel it .
now , i know that there are family feuds .
until i got to my house , where the client was my wife .
so , effectively we created a digital puppet that brad pitt could operate with his own face .
some of them are agglomerating together to form larger particles .
and how do you make it simple ?
and that wasn &apos;t the goal . it wasn &apos;t the point . right ?
they &apos;ve also saved me from my righteous anger by offering insights into this third way .
the glacial silence we have experienced in the face of the shredding of the constitution , the unraveling of our public institutions , the deterioration of our infrastructure is not limited to the universities .
virtually every society has ingested psychoactive substances to deal with pain , increase our energy , socialize , even commune with god .
and they started slashing away at the back of the camels , and they started galloping .
and actually this last guy here said a phrase a few years ago that i think fits perfectly to the situation of rio winning the olympic bid .
when yared was seven years old his father died , and his mother sent him to go live with an uncle , who was a priest of the ethiopian orthodox tradition , one of the oldest churches in the world .
we tend to meet disclosure with disclosure , even with strangers .
the real challenge then , is to try to figure out how we can change rules .
carlos had post-traumatic stress disorder .
it &apos;s the only possible explanation of why humans , if they &apos;re very unlucky , can become grossly obese , in a way that would be totally impossible for any other primate , physically impossible .
what about anyone with body image stuff going on ?
i &apos;m listening to the sound of my voice , my voice on surreptitiously taped phone calls that a supposed friend had made the year before .
but before we pat ourselves too much on the back , we have poured 151 megawatt hours of energy into constructing this house when there was a house there before .
what &apos;s a drug ? a drug is made up of a small molecule of hydrogen , carbon , oxygen , nitrogen , and a few other atoms all cobbled together in a shape , and it &apos;s those shapes that determine whether , in fact , that particular drug is going to hit its target .
thank you . ( applause )
realizing that nyota might get hurt , panbanisha , like any human mother , carefully tugs to get the scissors back .
how much ?
the first is that there is so much more to learn and we &apos;re not making the investment in fully understanding the extent of these sex differences .
and that &apos;s where our goal is — to have something clinically pragmatic to wear .
i want to hold your hand . i want to hold your hand .
so how do we prevent them ?
no helicopter can reach you out there , and no plane can land .
we could make a space for change .
but it wasn &apos;t enough to use the priests .
and if you look at the figures up there , it says that we have a third more mouths to feed , but we need an agricultural production increase of 70 percent .
and i meet them at the university , i also have a few field offices that i set up in various places that provide an immersion in some of the environmental challenges we face .
let me show you some brief clips , so you have a sense for what that actually looked like on the ground .
so maybe &quot; &quot; history doesn &apos;t repeat itself , but sometimes it rhymes . &quot; &quot; today , productivity is at an all-time high , and despite the great recession , it grew faster in the 2000s than it did in the 1990s , the roaring 1990s , and that was faster than the &apos; 70s or &apos; 80s .
one of the works , in fact , so didn &apos;t meet her mark , she had set it out in the trash in her studio , and her neighbor had taken it because she saw its value .
( applause )
in the side effect profile , etc . , you want to see where those genes are turned on .
and i &apos;m in favor , actually . of course i am .
it &apos;s a tool used by those in power against those who have no power .
internationally comparable data on life expectancy , on kids &apos; maths and literacy scores , on infant mortality rates , homicide rates , proportion of the population in prison , teenage birthrates , levels of trust , obesity , mental illness — which in standard diagnostic classification includes drug and alcohol addiction — and social mobility .
so , this is what sristi is saying : &quot; give me a place to stand , and i will move the world . &quot;
he &apos;s back to his normal life .
i wanted to put these people on a pedestal .
so they identified that as a priority , and then they &apos;ve got and recruited now 300 researchers from around the world that are studying that topic , essentially the same topic .
what i really did was i just followed nature , and nature doesn &apos;t know monocultures , but a natural forest is multilayered .
you don &apos;t need to dig down for these chemicals , and we can do things much more efficiently .
that raises another wrinkle when it comes to war and conflict . good guys might play around and work on these as hobby kits , but so might bad guys .
they could not confront myself , with myself as a normal human being .
now , here &apos;s the thing : the subject has no idea what all the patterns mean , but we &apos;re seeing if he gets better at figuring out which button to press .
jabbar : you can , even if you don &apos;t believe in yourself right now .
it &apos;s that we expect them to bring us happiness .
it actually reflects changes in the brain that provide an excellent opportunity for education and social development . thank you . ( applause ) ( applause )
rives : so that &apos;s &quot; &quot; close encounters , &quot; &quot; and the main character is all worked up because aliens , momentously , have chosen to show themselves to earthlings at four in the morning , which does make that a very solid example .
and we &apos;ll have a chance to solve a 3,000 year old dispute .
student 4l : &#91; i decided to &#93; do the shot put and the sponge ball because they &apos;re two totally different weights , and if you drop them at the same time , maybe they &apos;ll drop at the same speed .
if we looked in the world of 1945 and looked at the map of capitalist economies and democratic polities , they were the rare exception , not the norm .
so , the emotional and intellectual profits are huge — the acquisition of leadership , teaching and training principles , the sense of commitment , responsibility , generosity and dedication to others , and the individual contribution to achieve great collective goals .
the largest set piece in the opera is called the system . it &apos;s a series of books .
but what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones .
broadband is not necessary .
right ? why would work tire us if it &apos;s in our nature ?
and right now most of the preparedness is deeply flawed .
and i think this is something really important .
she is an illiterate girl , trained , skilled as a welder .
they don &apos;t feel as if they &apos;re doing something that really matters to them , so they pick up these kinds of activities .
( laughter ) so , nobody would like this .
but you can see the beginning of an idea there , because you can see the word &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; emerging from the &quot; &quot; old . &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what happens .
( applause ) when i went to visit him two days later , he gave me a hug and was crying and thanking me for saving his life .
there &apos;s a cave where all these animal-headed creatures travel between two worlds .
well , it &apos;s simple in the sense that it has fewer neurons , but is that a fair metric ?
jh : are you ripping off somebody else &apos;s avatar with that , sort of — pr : no , no . i didn &apos;t . one of the other guys at work had a fantastic avatar — a female avatar — that i used to be once in a while .
here it says the word &quot; &quot; mathematics . &quot; &quot; but actually , they &apos;re just dots , right ?
their marketing is slightly different .
we have to , we must .
and i ...
so there are 30 wars that are about as deadly as the six days war , but there &apos;s only four wars that are 100 times deadlier — like world war i.
but nobody was really worried about this .
he looks pretty good at this stage .
we collected 200,000 jars of peanut butter and over 365,000 valentine &apos;s day cards .
he just sat there watching me cry for an hour .
this young man posted a video of him abusing his cat on youtube .
he &apos;s just moved house . he &apos;s got no friends .
last january , my company , fark.com , was sued along with yahoo , msn , reddit , aol , techcrunch and others by a company called gooseberry natural resources .
i am very happy and honored to be amidst very , very innovative and intelligent people .
so , it goes from a circle , to a round , to a square , to a figure eight .
to actually make the robot , we take inspiration from two organisms .
in a wimbledon final match , these two guys fight it out .
the last time i heard my son &apos;s voice was when he walked out the front door on his way to school .
the price of human beings across the last 4,000 years in today &apos;s money has averaged about 40,000 dollars .
but what if i lived in a food desert ?
what we say — and i include the most austerely mechanistic among us , which is probably me — what we say is , &quot; &quot; vile monster , prison is too good for you . &quot; &quot; or worse , we seek revenge , in all probability thereby triggering the next phase in an escalating cycle of counter-revenge , which we see , of course , all over the world today .
and so we peer through a legal microscope , and look at everything .
it &apos;s efficient not only because toyota invested in material science but because they invested in behavioral science .
electronics kits are very powerful in that they teach us how things work , but the constraints inherent in their design influence the way we learn .
yeah . totally .
to pretend they &apos;re not a mess when they are a mess .
again , you can do that outside and just let it dry in the air .
first , population growth .
and so far there are only three major sources of that — coal and gas , hydro-electric , which in most places is maxed-out — and nuclear .
and be able to type into wolfram alpha , &quot; &quot; the theory of the universe , &quot; &quot; and have it tell us .
and it just went to prove that storytelling has guidelines , not hard , fast rules .
but the next step is called &quot; &quot; universal responsibility . &quot; &quot; and that is very important — the charter of compassion must lead us to develop through true compassion , what is called &quot; &quot; universal responsibility . &quot; &quot; in the great teaching of his holiness the dalai lama that he always teaches everywhere , he says that that is the common religion of humanity : kindness .
and as she did , other ones came to mind .
elam &apos;s graduates : are they proving this audacious experiment right ?
erinaceous : pertaining to the hedgehog family ; of the nature of a hedgehog .
not at all .
it &apos;s just fabulous . ( laughter ) also , the way i dress has changed .
and i asked him , &quot; &quot; how is it possible to do this ? &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; well , i guess with everything in life , there &apos;s a place of balance . &quot; &quot; and this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point .
a room like this has acoustics , this one very good acoustics .
we even heal them .
i &apos;m going to log in .
we feel we &apos;re on the beginning of a journey of experiment and improvement to turn the studio school idea into something which is present , not as a universal answer for every child , but at least as an answer for some children in every part of the world .
and that , by the way , is why i think men so often wear ties . ( laughter )
that &apos;s a haiti earthquake every eight days .
so we worked hard to refocus our agenda , to maximize efficient mobility , providing more room for buses , more room for bikes , more room for people to enjoy the city , and to make our streets as safe as they can be for everybody that uses them .
and i think this is a really important thing that we do all the time .
here are some selection planes .
and i asked the founder of this effort , called tahrir supplies , how long it took him to go from when he had the idea to when he got started .
and i &apos;m following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as i &apos;m holding the light in the same position , i &apos;m getting the same type of reflection on it — that &apos;s the level of detail i &apos;m going into this thing .
the fuel , like i said , is ceramic inside zirconium fuel rods , and in the event of an accident in one of these type of reactors , fukushima and three mile island — looking back at three mile island , we didn &apos;t really see this for a while — but these zirconium claddings on these fuel rods , what happens is , when they see high pressure water , steam , in an oxidizing environment , they &apos;ll actually produce hydrogen , and that hydrogen has this explosive capability to release fission products .
in fact , if you look just at the upper and northern states in the west , they could do geothermal , or you could look at texas and say , we could lead the nation in the solutions to smart grid .
so , okay .
first of all , i &apos;d like to give you an argument for why that list is complete .
so on the one hand , there was a mocking of authority , but on the other hand , there was a deference towards authority , and these caribbean people had an overbearing obedience towards authority , which is very striking , very strange in a way , because migrants are very courageous people .
sarah smith , who was a mathematics professor at mit , wrote , &quot; &quot; the playful search for beauty was man &apos;s first activity — that all useful qualities and all material qualities were developed from the playful search for beauty . &quot; &quot; these are tiles . the word , &quot; &quot; playful &quot; &quot; is a necessary aspect of our work because , actually , one of our problems is that we have to make , produce , lovely things throughout all of life , and this for me is now 75 years .
would they really have different laws ?
and then we were going to have lunch with the mayor and we were going to have dinner with the most important people in malaga .
i hope that &apos;s a non-controversial statement .
we then take the parks and lay them out as ecological infrastructure .
that awful buzzing sound at night around your ears that drives you absolutely crazy ?
there are lots of people who believe that , and i think it is utter baloney .
we call it &quot; &quot; proofing . &quot; &quot; proofing means to prove that the dough is alive .
so what do you do ?
just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect : when we teach people about the pleasant life , how to have more pleasure in your life , one of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills , the savoring skills , and you &apos;re assigned to design a beautiful day .
( laughter ) a gigantic helmet .
furthermore , there &apos;s an experimental way to tell this theory , apart from the inflationary explanation that i told you before .
what we &apos;re trying to do , or what we believe , because this is how we believe the world really works , is that without the environment you have nothing .
eventually , these technologies will become so powerful that we will use them to know ourselves by deconstructing and reconstructing our own brains .
very next day , i bopped into school with my brand new air jordans , man , i was cool .
and people always say , is that really what you guys are still doing ?
i was there . evel knievel was my friend .
and as you breathe , think about what is in your breath .
tesla , what is 236 multiplied by 501 ?
a couple years ago , i was in south africa on safari .
and we need to be able to build this thing using simple manufacturing techniques and factories that don &apos;t cost us a fortune .
in other words , unlike the word hope , which one could look up in a dictionary and derive origins for , and , perhaps , reach some kind of a consensual use analysis , these are essentially contested concepts .
to begin with , artificial landscapes , which i invented sort of , are used in cinema all the time .
i love to think what they thought , what it was like .
to sort of illustrate that , this diagram emphasizes that if you &apos;ve got a sick person in bed , somebody &apos;s going to be taking out the contaminated materials .
and you have a problem making ends meet .
they &apos;re focusing on very cheap , very easy-to-use tools .
then i &apos;m going tell you about what we , as sex workers , actually want .
( applause )
so this — ( applause ) thank you very much . ( applause ) this is not only useful for stadia . we can use that also in open-air places and streets , and we &apos;ve been working on the city of the future in masdar , which is in the united emirates , abu dhabi .
and geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology .
now just because we have a distributed foot and spines doesn &apos;t mean you can climb vertical surfaces .
you turn a faucet and there is warm water and cold water , and drinkable water .
( laughter ) so that christmas — maybe i &apos;ve got time for this — that christmas i got the mister wizard fun-o-rama chemistry set .
as a person who buys the products .
bernard devauchelle and sylvie testelin , who did the first operation , are studying that .
we use technology to define ourselves by sharing our thoughts and feelings even as we &apos;re having them .
north korea did that to some extent .
you can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted .
the luwak is an asian palm civet .
it is not a fork designed to grab three hors d &apos;oeuvres at a time , which would be useful out in the lobby , i would say .
but we were still missing a critical element .
it &apos;s impossible .
taking that idiom of , as it were , the darkness of the body transferred to architecture , can you use architectural space not for living but as a metaphor , and use its systolic , diastolic smaller and larger spaces to provide a kind of firsthand somatic narrative for a journey through space , light and darkness ?
and it has altered the earth . it covers earth like a skin .
and a clash is going to take place , like on the banks of the indus .
and we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges , to do that which we must do .
researchers at the cdc and other places have increasingly been linking suburban development patterns with sedentary lifestyles .
and most importantly , they show us it &apos;s never too late to change your story .
( laughter ) so it was traumatizing , actually .
we were saying no to something that was very important to them , challenging their code of honor , and hurting them deeply in the process .
and so glaciers are these magnificent beings , and there &apos;s lots of reasons to be obsessed with them , but what i &apos;m particularly interested in is in human-glacier relations .
but lately i have had the opportunity to take a step back and ask myself : &quot; &quot; what is it over the last few years that helped me grow my website , but also grow myself ? &quot; &quot; and i &apos;ve summarized those things , for me personally , as three as .
we &apos;re going to see them more like this , as part of the productive , organic framework of which they are inevitably a part , symbiotically connected .
( beep ) ( beep ) ( beep ) kt : oh , my god !
the colors are codes for the direction , from whether it is back to front or vice versa .
somehow in tickling our eardrum that transmits energy down our hearing bones , which get converted to a fluid impulse inside the cochlea and then somehow converted into an electrical signal in our auditory nerves that somehow wind up in our brains as a perception of a song or a beautiful piece of music .
partly , they &apos;d had a bit of a delay .
you can have winds 20 to 40 miles an hour .
one way to look at it is this .
and there &apos;s the first little cam that drove furby .
you know , they engage .
&quot; &quot; it hurt so much , and i shed some tears , but something inside of me wanted to do this despite his words .
that &apos;s lower than the figure in the united states .
so the people of the gulf have essentially been subsidizing the rest of us through a less-clean environment .
in response , tens of thousands of dissatisfied citizens poured into central kiev to demonstrate against this allegiance .
but losing weight alone will not get you across the finish line with a winning time .
it was just called &quot; &quot; tall horse , &quot; &quot; which was a life-sized giraffe .
so this is the sort of momentum that we &apos;ve got at the moment .
&quot; &quot; naked city &quot; &quot; is a nickname for new york , and &quot; &quot; spleen &quot; &quot; embodies the melancholia and inertia that come from feeling alienated in an urban environment .
so about a hundred years ago , some scientists invented a stain that would stain cells .
and so if i &apos;m going to pursue them , i need to have the capability to go after them , and again , the controls are in how i apply that capability , not that i have the capability itself .
so it could be from writing to our local politician to talking to our boss at work or being the boss at work , or talking with our friends and family , or , quite simply , changing our lifestyles .
( laughter ) you — so it &apos;s — yes , he likes that .
imagine that you slice your body in all these directions , and then you try to put the slices back together again into a pile of data , into a block of data .
so epilepsy patients sometimes need the electrical activity in their brain monitoring .
it &apos;s 23 feet long and just six feet across at its widest point .
the next morning , when she comes again to the so-called clinic , her first patient is waiting for her with her husband .
pure content and pure form , side by side .
so that ice sheet is partly floating , and it &apos;s exposed to the ocean , to the ocean heat .
i looked for temporary materials , like spitting out food — ( laughter ) — sidewalk chalk and even frozen wine .
they also exist as corporate entities .
benki came back to his village full of ideas — new technologies , new research , new ways of understanding what was going on .
it &apos;s been tremendously powerful for consumers .
so it doesn &apos;t matter whether we choose nuclear power or carbon capture and storage , upscale our biofuel production , or go for a much bigger roll-out of wind turbines and wave turbines .
contemplation , meditation , being deep in thought .
i thought i &apos;d begin with a scene of war .
and beyond all that , the chinese have this feeling in their heart of hearts and in their gut of guts that those of us in the collective west are just too damned arrogant .
so wherever you look , the message , it seems to me , is the same : that less is very often more , that slower is very often better . but that said , of course , it &apos;s not that easy to slow down , is it ?
and i realized , of course , this dialogue is definitely not occurring in the public at large .
well , of course , as soon as anybody did look , which was after about 20 years , when radio astronomy really took off . because it turned out the universe is absolutely full of all kinds of wonderful things radiating in the radio spectrum , much brighter than the sun .
i want you to breathe in . this is what i say .
this is a little piano circuit right in here , and this is an ordinary paintbrush that i smashed it together with . ( beeping ) and so , with some ketchup , — ( musical notes ) — and then i can kind of — ( musical notes ) — ( laughter ) ( applause ) and that &apos;s awesome , right ?
and this is the kind of city that &apos;s devoid of smell , devoid of mess , certainly devoid of people , because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape .
i want to argue that though africa is not the front line in the war against terror , it could be soon .
like , oh , i don &apos;t know , tedx usc .
i believe that we all have a vision for healthcare in this country .
suddenly these characters that you &apos;ve fallen in love with become husks of themselves , they &apos;re shadows of themselves .
or vice versa , because they are less productive , we put more pressure and they are less engaged .
thank you .
money is not capital in most of the developing countries .
again , you can &apos;t really see much .
they do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures , many of which are similar , or even identical , to ours and formed in the same context . greeting chimpanzees embracing .

his family lost everything , and at age 11 , he had to live in motels with his dad , motels that would round up all of their food and keep it hostage until they were able to pay the bill .
independent diplomat is now established in five diplomatic centers around the world , and we &apos;re advising seven or eight different countries , or political groups , depending on how you wish to define them — and i &apos;m not big on definitions .
yeah , so what we &apos;d do if we had you who gave the answer as a participant , we would have calibrated the difficulty level of the puzzles to your expertise .
then i got married .
so looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design , interiors and furniture , we came up with the solution of taking an old airstream trailer and gutting it , and trying to portray laminate , and a trailer , in kind of a fresh , new contemporary look .
( applause )
i think that &apos;s very , very important .
frankly , it &apos;s a sector that many of us who work in the field worry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology .
do we have the comparative advantage to use another sort of energy ?
and that experiment was done in northern alabama .
actually , it &apos;s not , it &apos;s actually an important social cue .
and what psychologists and behavioral economists have discovered is that by and large people use two simple rules .
and in a short period of time , the city went to a 30-year crime low .
and i wanted this guy to be involved in my crazy project , and he was kind enough to lend his image to the character of eugène spaak , who is a cosmologist and artist who seeks relation in between time , space , love , music and women .
they had fixed behaviors .
which size ? it &apos;s a piece of cake . i like challenges . which size ?
the advent of the internet definitely helped her .
and in these instances , the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards , from the last word to the first .
the point of the website is that it denounces terrorism while recognizing that it &apos;s ridiculous that we have to constantly denounce terrorism .
right now , we have a quarter of a million people that have signed up for protonmail , and these people come from everywhere , and this really shows that privacy is not just an american or a european issue , it &apos;s a global issue that impacts all of us .
( fussing ) ( laughter ) ls : so you just saw two 15-month-old babies do entirely different things based only on the probability of the sample they observed .
you take these particles . you slam them together .
that &apos;s where his strength lies .
so what you suddenly started to realize — or what i started to realize — is that when you started having conversations with these companies , the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem .
fears also have plots . they have beginnings and middles and ends .
so this came out in a scientific journal a few years ago , but more importantly , it was featured on &quot; &quot; csi : miami , &quot; &quot; so you really know it &apos;s true .
so we could make this problem go away simply by making clean needles universally available and taking away the fear of arrest .
he didn &apos;t have to select that from a menu .
on top of that , we selected some strategic points reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines , and this modified this initial pattern .
how could i have been so blind ?
in general , and maybe , again , it &apos;s because i &apos;m a tech entrepreneur , i look at things as platforms .
and guess what ?
ca : can we take a look at this ?
and there is no way of your being not limitless too .
&quot; ... who said , reach out and touch ... &quot; ( laughter )
they still have to start from scratch every single time , and that &apos;s because they never learn .
eh : you &apos;re a pro .
what i came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell .
go home and ask those questions , and then help the people around you .
my friend adam curtis says that maybe the internet is like a john carpenter movie from the 1980s , when eventually everyone will start screaming at each other and shooting each other , and then eventually everybody would flee to somewhere safer , and i &apos;m starting to think of that as a really nice option .
let me explain why by taking the example from my own career as a filmmaker .
and if you have been looking at the headlines lately , then you will see that we have discovered a subsurface ocean on europa , on ganymede , on enceladus , on titan , and now we are finding a geyser and hot springs on enceladus , our solar system is turning into a giant spa .
now , if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons and fire into this bottle , how will those photons shatter into this bottle ?
according to burrelles , the movie premiered in january , and since then — and this isn &apos;t even the whole thing — we &apos;ve had 900 million media impressions for this film .
only together can we solve these big problems .
so we basically figured out which bones are important for us and collected their motion in 3d .
so what i &apos;m saying is that entrepreneurship is where it &apos;s at .
&quot; why don &apos;t you try ? &quot;
here &apos;s rhex entering the woods .
( laughter ) ( audio ) nr : and i &apos;m thinking , what ? that &apos;s amazing — if it &apos;s true .
as one of them said to me , &quot; ron , we ain &apos;t going anywhere at the moment . &quot;
that problem is solved .
you can see from the slide , very very strong .
pollution , global warming , these things — the consequences are distant in time and space .
it &apos;s an object that behaves like a wave , so that it doesn &apos;t just move in one direction or the other , but can follow multiple pathways at the same time .
and the future , for them , doesn &apos;t look particularly promising — in fact , it &apos;s downright bleak .
they came to earth briefly transformed to stop you from being artistic , from becoming artists .
the length is smaller by eight percent by the way .
and what we can see is that just over these few weeks , we have a much more radical change , a setback of many months of normal development , followed by a relatively rapid recovery , and by the time he reaches day 838 , which is the end of this video , you can see that he has essentially reached the healthy adult stool community , despite that antibiotic intervention .
so how might the airplane of the future look ?
as humans , ultimately being part of the universe , we &apos;re kind of the spokespeople or the observer part of the constituency of the universe .
i &apos;d encountered so much strange love , and i fell very naturally into its bewitching patterns .
no meals on saturday .
that &apos;s fun .
( laughter ) and there was only about 30 to help retire the debt .
through that small little slit between the glass box and the wood , the air goes underneath the sculpture and creates the other one .
and it &apos;s pretty simple .
so it had better be the gist of the gist , right ?
and i went to visit louise bourgeoise , who &apos;s also still working , and i looked at her sink , which is really amazing , and left .
and it was really interesting because i was the last speaker and before me there were people that were really talking about luxury , and i didn &apos;t want to be a party pooper but at the same time i felt that i had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality .
there are nest maintenance workers working throughout the nest .
you didn &apos;t claim to be anything .
we don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
you can &apos;t actually build much on a roof , they &apos;re not designed for that .
it &apos;s tricky .
and even when i first flew in the shuttle back in 1995 , 74 shuttle flight , the odds were still now that we look back about one in 38 or so — one in 35 , one in 40 .
family history says he loved being a fireman , and so in 1938 , on one of his days off , he elected to hang out at the firehouse .
so with very little effort , you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters , which is the same as a chinese eight-year-old .
and here is what we got .
now there &apos;s a problem there , and we &apos;ll come back to it in a minute , which is that if you bring the most powerful together to make the rules in treaty-based institutions , to fill that governance space , then what happens to the weak who are left out ?
and whilst i &apos;m painting i have to be very careful , because the paint starts to turn into little blobs .
anyway , there isn &apos;t . ( laughter ) you don &apos;t need something more to explain something more .
in this nursery , we &apos;re going to grow 10 times more than the number of species .
( &quot; &quot; although it &apos;s nothing serious , let &apos;s keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn &apos;t turn into a major lawsuit . &quot; &quot; ) and we certainly see it in the world of business .
it all feeds in as minute reinforcement .
here is a fact that might surprise you : 413 billion dollars , 413 billion dollars was the amount of remittances sent last year by migrants to developing countries .
just like many of them , i was completely apolitical until 2009 .
and matthew has made this remarkable observation that i &apos;m just going to offer you and let it sit .
weddings were reported to be interrupted so guests could cluster around the t.v. set , and then turn their attention back to the bride and groom .
now i have to confess , when i was a college undergraduate , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex — it seemed pretty reasonable at the time , but with each passing year , i &apos;ve come to have increasing doubts .
which is — you know , like check it out , i &apos;m pretty young , i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
in our accelerated media culture , desertification is simply too slow to reach the headlines .
and for three to four years , i went to university .
and actually , although we &apos;ve got a long way to go and a lot of work to do , i can see the day where my two great passions — cars and the environment — actually come into harmony .
it turned out , the light in that room was slightly different .
well , we decided we were going to create growth charts of social engagement .
but during that entire process , more and more people have been born , and more and more people are moving to cities .
and it &apos;s pretty incredible because i took my iphone there , and he was like , &quot; &quot; yeah , do you want an upgrade ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) i was a bit skeptical , but then , i decided to give him a nokia instead . ( laughter ) but what i was amazed about is this reverse engineering and know-how that &apos;s built into this little two meters of space .
but when it comes to consciousness , questions about behavior are among the easy problems .
in the first phase of this testing , which is called testing for toxicity , it &apos;s called phase i.
i mean these guys are extrapolating in realms that are not necessarily valid .
that is , almost everybody sees the planet saturn .
then finally she said , &quot; &quot; the third thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll never drink alcohol . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) well i was nine years old , so i said , &quot; &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot; &quot; i grew up in the country in the rural south , and i have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger .
these are the rocks kanzi used and these are the flakes he made .
so when we developed glass , we thought really about , can we make something that frees your hands ?
now , when an ecologist looks at the ocean — i have to tell you — we look at the ocean in a very different way , and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean because when an ecologist looks at the ocean , we see all those interconnections .
but you can also talk about sunny places .
my friend , on the other hand , she was a good terrorist because she was very good at following orders .
hey , hey , black-eyed susie ! hey , hey , black-eyed susie !
simply by making it happen .
foremost , it was its enormous power , because it united different functions in one organization .
ra : so now you &apos;re about to see how we do our own movies here , with or without any assistance from anybody .
since 1970 , no human beings have been back to the moon .
and today i will tell you about five of them and their particular features and why these plants are so unique .
and i guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg , or something like that , and then you wait , and , lo and behold , out pops a little baby dinosaur .
then after this , you go to crystal chamber .
and we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards , and we &apos;re destroying the world .
there &apos;s actually more mountains in the ocean than there are on land .
let me highlight a couple of things here in the fake review . the first is that liars tend to think about narrative . they make up a story : who ? and what happened ? and that &apos;s what happened here .
( applause ) i hope you enjoyed mathemagics .
the old man turned to me and he said , &quot; you could pick a red card or a black card . &quot;
but we needed to get a database of him doing more than that .
this is about citizens taking action .
so that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking for developing . ( applause ) and we replace the human being — to go , for example , for measuring radioactivity , you don &apos;t want a human to be sailing those robots — with batteries , motors , micro-controllers and sensors .
imagine if instead of facing that , they could actually face the regeneration of that limb .
tragically , she passed away before he did , and he &apos;s big on delegation , and — ( laughter ) — he said — ca : tweet that .
no , the pioneer is the one who allows himself to throw overboard a lot of ballast .
so my plea today to everyone , especially those who sincerely believe in islamist jihadism ...
and when you use indoor spraying with ddt and those nets you can cut deaths by over 50 percent .
and by the way , this appeal went through after he had finished serving his sentence , so he was out and working at a job and taking care of his family and he had to go back into jail .
that was the only criteria , was that you be — you looked like a gentleman , and they &apos;d let anybody could come .
it feels the force , understands that chris is there and doesn &apos;t push through him and hurt him .
someone is always watching .
consider the ancient greek myth explaining seasons .
it &apos;s just steel and timber .
so it &apos;s reasonable to say that grand crossing is already in the process of being something different than it is today .
facing the given with intent . doing things by design .
this is deeply democratizing .
and this was a hard shot to get — i think this is the shot of the ant foot on the superstrings .
&quot; &quot; there are three sorts of people in the world : those who are immovable , people who don &apos;t get it , or don &apos;t want to do anything about it ; there are people who are movable , people who see the need for change and are prepared to listen to it ; and there are people who move , people who make things happen . &quot; &quot; and if we can encourage more people , that will be a movement .
it &apos;s nearly impossible to get paint to stick to the grease in an egg .
they &apos;re looking for answers to questions , and they want to take action when they &apos;re done , which is really hard to do from a site that looks like this .
and it hadn &apos;t been up for more than a couple hours before i received this exuberant email from the guy who mailed me this postcard .
and our anatomists are going to go in and take a deeper look at this .
that &apos;s really bad for the worker .
the government must be planning a massacre tomorrow . &quot; &quot; i was hit hard on my head .
so in this next experiment , we &apos;re going to give babies just a tiny bit of statistical data supporting one hypothesis over the other , and we &apos;re going to see if babies can use that to make different decisions about what to do .
how to move you with your emotions , but also make your mind work .
a lot of kids were being referred to me for adhd , or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , but when i actually did a thorough history and physical , what i found was that for most of my patients , i couldn &apos;t make a diagnosis of adhd .
in europe alone , by 2050 , there is going to be a 70 percent increase of individuals over 65 , and 170 percent increase in individuals over 80 .
i think they &apos;d make good allies .
it &apos;s going to be a place where people can meet , where you can put nature .

this was scott fischer , rob hall , andy harris , doug hansen and yasuko namba .
another major revolution : the communications revolution .
i got rid of all my poly-cotton t-shirts .
and what he said was that this mindset , this framework discovered by bentham , was the key means of societal control for modern , western societies , which no longer need the overt weapons of tyranny — punishing or imprisoning or killing dissidents , or legally compelling loyalty to a particular party — because mass surveillance creates a prison in the mind that is a much more subtle though much more effective means of fostering compliance with social norms or with social orthodoxy , much more effective than brute force could ever be .
so she &apos;s stunned that he &apos;s standing in a subway station .
you &apos;re probably asking that . why should you care ?
adam ockelford : i promise there won &apos;t be too much of me talking , and a lot of derek playing , but i thought it would just be nice to recap on how derek got to where he is today .
he basically said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve designed everything . &quot; &quot; and also ikko tanaka was a very important mentor in my life — the paul rand of japan . he designed most of the major icons of japan , like issey miyake &apos;s brand and also muji .
&quot; &quot; bring these kids home because they are misled . &quot; &quot; but yes , these youth who have been inspired by universal values , who are idealistic enough to imagine a magnificent future and , at the same time , realistic enough to balance this kind of imagination and the process leading to it — not using violence , not trying to create chaos — these young people , they did not go home .
and eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic .
tell us , charlie , why would you say he should be able to use a golf cart ?
so from that day on , i was an ordinary kid walking around on dry land , but my head was down there , underwater .
these kids are real pros . there were just 7,000 machines out there being tested by kids . being a nonprofit is absolutely fundamental .
again , it &apos;s noisy . they &apos;re playing for dancers .
well , i know the world is flat now .
if you think about it , it &apos;s the very least that we owe our fellow citizens . thank you . ( applause )
they are in this constant state of wonder , and i do firmly believe that we can keep listening like these seven-year-old children , even when growing up .
shortly after i walked into my new school , a huge fight broke out among the girls .
you , your miserableness , have got to be kidding . &quot; &quot; and they say , &quot; &quot; no , no , that &apos;s what it says here in our holy book . &quot; &quot; cut to our century , same country , same pyramids , another people spreading the same idea of equality with a different book .
it does increase security .
what does that mean ?
we ingest nutrients . we excrete nutrients as well .
and then he went and knocked an old lady house .
and you actually did inspire me . i looked at you , i thought , well , he &apos;s made it . maybe there is a different way .

ca : can you give us a sense of what it &apos;s like in those negotiations ?
why have i chosen to talk to you about the phosphorus crisis today ?
but it &apos;s a misconstrual .
there was no time to develop it .
here &apos;s the key feature though . these neurons are also involved in the way you can assign value to literally abstract ideas , and i put some symbols up here that we assign value to for various reasons .
so those three ways — transparency , accountability and choice — will make a huge difference .
but only if i get permission from my dad .
it wasn &apos;t until days later as i lay in a coma that the doctors diagnosed me with bacterial meningitis , a vaccine-preventable blood infection .
how long did it take to go from one system to the next ?
and he cues in a flute player like this .
i thought , at the time , i did a pretty good job .
ak : it works good .
the present encapsulates the past and a promise for the future .
fujifilm survived because it applied the principles of prudence , diversity and adaptation .
i used to carry a big gun .
but in 2008 , there isn &apos;t one single american city that has done effective plans to deal with a nuclear detonation disaster .

be my guest , do your best , harvest me , track the clues .
we don &apos;t really think of the evolutionary need to be protected by our senses , but that &apos;s probably why our senses really evolved — to keep us safe , to allow us to live .
so , you know , this does happen .
my story is the power of thought .
but it was really about the fact that i was looking for a project on my own and there was no open source , really , on my radar at all .
the consequence of that is that all those nutrients that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries , of the sardines of california or in peru or whatever , those slow down and those fisheries collapse .
they &apos;ve created jobs .
so i made sure the work was not compromised in any way and that the integrity of the work remained the same .
months later , she was joking that her husband had threatened to pull her out of the classes , as he found out that his now literate wife was going through his phone text messages .

where does my fish come from ?
the weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion — 10 to the 21st — molecules of isoprene .
i do know that education is a huge part of it .
why do we travel too much ?
so here &apos;s the world , and here we are in bali .
that &apos;s when the dinosaurs went extinct , that &apos;s when 75 percent of the animal and plant species went extinct , and that &apos;s when mammals overtook their ecological niche , and to anthropomorphize , biological evolution said , &quot; hmm , this neocortex is pretty good stuff , &quot; and it began to grow it .
that is how we live .
and i quit .
we need to make the gas price better reflect the real cost of oil .
i call it the idea of tribes .
it &apos;s just never going to happen . &quot; &quot; it took me a couple of days to fully absorb this incident and its implications , but once i did , i reached three conclusions .

i did expect it to be difficult , have sleepless nights , constant feedings , but i did not expect the feelings of isolation and loneliness that i experienced , and i was really surprised that no one had talked to me , that i was going to be feeling this way .
if you want to get to the phoenix islands , it &apos;s five days from fiji , it &apos;s five days from hawaii , it &apos;s five days from samoa .
bg : that &apos;s the most important .
and it seems like every department had nothing , so they had to rely on our creativity and turn every problem into an opportunity .
they &apos;re doing it because they are expecting things to happen .
stem cells provide hope for new beginnings — small , incremental steps , cells rather than organs , repair rather than replacement .
okay , we know how to measure attention in the lab .
and what i &apos;m going to do is to show you pretty much what &apos;s here .
the typical city is more like cedar rapids , where they have an all four-lane system , half one-way system .
it &apos;s a movie . i did &quot; &quot; the tempest &quot; &quot; on a stage three times in the theater since 1984 , &apos; 86 , and i love the play .
it &apos;s a circle of silk on the floor that disappears into the hole in the stage floor .
and space does not exist for most people .
why was it effective ?

we paid a lot of money for that information , be we didn &apos;t get it .
the principle behind the mouthguard is this : it fits onto your teeth .
well my characters , like the ones in my shows , allow me to play with the spaces between those questions .
what africans practiced was a different form of capitalism , but then after independence , all of a sudden , markets , capitalism became a western institution , and the leaders said africans were ready for socialism .

bj : but we truly do spend day and night trying to capture unique footage .
this is version eight of this software , and do you know what they put in version eight ?
the bottom of it is carved from a grain of sand , because i wanted to get a bit of the stone effect .

so , very quickly , what is the optimal time profile ?
it &apos;s now an empty , six-acre lot waiting for a shopping mall right across from the new ikea .
i feel it &apos;s sort of like the vimalakirti sutra , an ancient work from ancient india in which the buddha appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people come to see him from the biggest city in the area , vaishali , and they bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make an offering to him .
you can also bike the tour de france without steroids , right ?
but remember this example .
or taking the time to look at a problem from all angles in the office to make the best decision at work .
here &apos;s a typical south atlantic contact call from the &apos; 70s .
can you imagine ?
now that &apos;s bigger than europe and america put together in today &apos;s money .
and the thing is , if we can put in all the words , no longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad , we can really describe the language like scientists .
this beetle , unlike this chip bag here , this beetle uses one material , chitin .
but unfortunately , as we &apos;re on our way to solving one monstrous problem — and as i said , we &apos;re not there yet ; we &apos;ve got a lot of work to do , but i can see where we will — but even as we &apos;re in the process of doing that , another huge problem is looming , and people aren &apos;t noticing .
anybody , quick ?
well , think about it this way . who changed ?
and so a punch card can hold about 80 characters , and you can fit about 2,000 or so cards into a box , and you put them in , say , my home region of new england , it would cover the entire region up to a depth of a little less than five kilometers , which is about three times deeper than the glaciers during the last ice age about 20,000 years ago .
you could now start doing surgery everywhere , on the gut , on the liver , on the heart , on the brain .
but it doesn &apos;t work , my eyes are still small .
you came back to — nl : radio operator .
the little dust particle will again , reflect the light , and we realize the existence of light .
he wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends who was j.d. hooker , or at that time , president of the royal society , so the maximum scientific authority in britain speaking about the brain in the plants .
if i asked you to picture the air , what do you imagine ?
after about an hour of speaking with jason , he asked us if we knew the story of pandora &apos;s box .
it &apos;s formal . it uses long sentences like this gibbon one .
so you need to help him out .
it is wrong . it is irresponsible .
or polio ? how many of you remember the iron lung ?
look around you — here will do , in this room .
and i had a lot of — always interested in the concept of a crystal ball .
it doesn &apos;t tell us about our dreams and our aspirations .
it &apos;s all just the same thing happening .
thank you so much .
( laughter ) in fact , i ’ m finished . science will never go away .
wonderful as they are , i believe the time has come for us to complement these bulky electronic giants with what nature has already invented : the microbe , a single-celled organism that is itself a self-generating , self-replenishing , living machine .
but the point is , by constantly depicting the state part as necessary but actually — pffff — a bit boring and often a bit dangerous kind of leviathan , i think we &apos;ve actually really stunted the possibility to build these public-private partnerships in a really dynamic way .
so will new power elites just become old power and squeeze ?
the light blue is refugee camps these volunteers had spotted from the &#91; satellite images &#93; .
he says , &quot; &quot; we need more boots on the ground in afghanistan . &quot; &quot; and everyone goes , &quot; &quot; great idea . &quot; &quot; he leaves , people go , &quot; &quot; no no no , we &apos;re not going to do that .
and then we need to pair those medical people with the military .
i photographed for over 30 hours in this picture .
look what they &apos;ve done .
so this perspective is perhaps justified .
these two titles both showed up in the top 50 entertainment titles in pc data — entertainment titles in pc data in december , right up there with &quot; &quot; john madden football , &quot; &quot; which thrills me to death .
we can see tendons and muscles .
and the epitome was when i literally marched into the streets of nyamirambo , which is the popular quarter of kigali , with a bucket , and i sold all these little doughnuts to people , and i came back , and i was like , &quot; &quot; you see ? &quot; &quot; and the women said , &quot; &quot; you know , jacqueline , who in nyamirambo is not going to buy doughnuts out of an orange bucket from a tall american woman ? &quot; &quot; and like — ( laughter ) — it &apos;s a good point .
to tell you about that i have to talk about this fellow here , his name is julius .
( music : &quot; &quot; la di da di &quot; &quot; by slick rick &amp; doug e. fresh ) ( music : &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t stop &quot; &quot; by miley cyrus ) so miley cyrus , who wasn &apos;t even born yet when &quot; &quot; la di da di &quot; &quot; was made , and neither were any of the co-writers on the song , has found this song that somehow etched its way into the collective consciousness of pop music , and now , with its timeless playfulness of the original , has kind of translated to a whole new generation who will probably co-opt it as their own .
when this story was published in the washington post , i started receiving death threats , and i was forced to leave afghanistan , as my parents were .
and as i did so , i started thinking : well , what are we actually looking at here ?
so the question is : how are we all going to respond to this ?
that patient was my government .
what i dispute is the conclusion that so many people draw from them , namely that we &apos;re all screwed because the problems are unsolvable and our governments are useless .
and do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound .
but then , given the way of the world , things change .
what &apos;s trending now ? what &apos;s the popular talk now ?
there &apos;s actually a company in greece that produces these cigarettes that actually contain hemoglobin from pigs in the filter .
i can &apos;t stop this from happening .
like , thoughts and ideas go in , but none ever comes out , i mean at least not that are revealing .
or we can just leave it to fate and continue on with a business-as-usual type of attitude .
( laughter ) a few years later , i heard a joke about the greatest violinist , jascha heifetz .
what you can find there is really evidence of a lost world .
( laughter ) this is not that catchy catchphrase .
i don &apos;t think the legislation is going anywhere , because they realized it is so hard to tell the difference between a pirated design and something that &apos;s just part of a global trend .
so i mean , the reason i put those things all together , ok , here &apos;s the way you &apos;re supposed to do science — some science is done for other reasons , and just curiosity .
and those differences can be biological , physical , functional , political , cultural , socioeconomic .
and so , as we evaluated , and as the dust settled from this tragedy , we realized that , of those two problems — in the initial iteration of our organization , we were a disaster response organization that was using veteran service . we had a lot of success , and we really felt like we were changing the disaster response paradigm .
it &apos;s used to puncture through the ligaments in the spine and deliver anesthesia during childbirth .
so on the same night that barack obama won his historic presidency , the lesbian and gay community suffered one of our most painful defeats .
fast-forward , 2004 : in the peak of our activism , the minister of gender liberia called me and said , &quot; &quot; leymah , i have a nine-year-old for you .
and of course , those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society .
and he did not want to pay .
and the object is the passive no-voice .
recently , at the seattle art museum , isaac bunn and i mounted this exhibition , and the exhibition was used as a platform to launch his voice .
and one doctor said to the others , &quot; &quot; did you see my article in the new england journal of medicine ? &quot; &quot; and the other said , &quot; &quot; no . that &apos;s great . congratulations ! &quot; &quot; the next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said , &quot; &quot; well while you were , you know , doing your research , &quot; &quot; — notice the condescending tone — &quot; &quot; while you were off doing your research , i was off doing more surgeries than anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution . &quot; &quot; and the third one got the same wry smile and said , &quot; &quot; well , while you were off doing your research , and you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery ,
and over that time , i &apos;ve seen a lot of crazy things in the markets , and i &apos;ve traded a lot of crazy manias .
so what we know from this picture is that the labor supply , so people who provide labor , will go down in germany , and will go down significantly .
we gather the world &apos;s only all-female orchestra , we play fantastic music by forgotten or overlooked women composers , we have amazing conductors — it &apos;s marin alsop there from baltimore conducting , petula clark singing — and i give a lecture on women &apos;s history .
( applause ) a long time ago in a galaxy — oops , wrong script .
the car pays for itself .
but if trees can create art , if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year , if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs , then perhaps there are other static entities that we hold inside ourselves , like grief , like addictions , like racism , that can also change .
you do not have to be a professional player to get insights about movement .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
the crowd on the day of weidmann &apos;s execution was called &quot; &quot; unruly &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; disgusting &quot; &quot; by the press , but that was nothing compared to the untold thousands of people who could now study the action over and over again , freeze-framed in every detail .
so , in favor of the proposition , possibly shockingly , is one of , truly , the founders of the environmental movement , a long-standing tedster , the founder of the whole earth catalog , someone we all know and love , stewart brand .
if you look at a map of cartel influence and violence , you will see that it almost perfectly aligns with the most efficient routes of transportation from the south to the north .
october , november , december . that is not the northeast monsoon season .
you want to lose weight in a way that enhances your health rather than the one that harms it .
what are we going to do about it ? i define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity , transparency and empathy , building humanity into communications .
as one woman said , &quot; &quot; i ’ ve got 20 friends in this package of cigarettes , and they ’ re always there for me and nobody else is .
but , if not , there is now high-definition surround sound .
six thousand miles of road , 600 miles of subway track , 400 miles of bike lanes and a half a mile of tram track , if you &apos;ve ever been to roosevelt island .
i call myself a maker of things .
yours is faith .
and what we find is that there &apos;s a wide diversity of performance in the world today .
it doesn &apos;t take lots of technology or biological evolution to be able to do arbitrary computation ; just something that happens , naturally , all over the place .
so this world that we live in , this world in which every conversation has the potential to devolve into an argument , where our politicians can &apos;t speak to one another and where even the most trivial of issues have someone fighting both passionately for it and against it , it &apos;s not normal .
so very small , but very useful .
recording : ♫ hey ♫ ♫ you &apos;re okay ♫ ♫ you &apos;ll be fine ♫ zf : so that &apos;s one of the better ones , really .
( &quot; &quot; intrigue and murder among 16th century ottoman court painters . &quot; &quot; ) ( laughter ) all right , so i got a collection of the paintings together and i looked at them and i deconstructed them and i put them back together .
it said , &quot; &quot; you know , this is a car that has lots of faults .
to 1,200 ? no .
this climber is on the last pitch of it .
the mycelium infuses all landscapes , it holds soils together , it &apos;s extremely tenacious .
the main reasons why people cooperated with the stasi were political conviction and material benefits .
and with a mobile phone , you can record a song , load it up to soundcloud and become famous .
but that made me think about collecting toys , and this thing that &apos;s going on right now in the toy world with blind box toys , and being able to collect these rare toys .
so , how do we rebuild it ?
this idea is nicely captured by this quote : &quot; &quot; things without all remedy should be without regard ; what &apos;s done is done . &quot; &quot; and it seems like kind of an admirable philosophy at first — something we might all agree to sign onto ...
but it was only when i interviewed mario moretti , the head of the red brigades , the man who kidnapped and killed aldo moro , italian former prime minister , that i finally realized that terrorism is actually business .
by 18 , under the excellent tutelage of my mother , i was therefore , as you might expect , defiantly feminist .
and i think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that , over the past couple of decades , we went from the physical world to the digital one .
( applause )
could you give us the money now ?
and then , in the postwar period , you had unusually high growth rate , partly due to the reconstruction .
and a lot of people talk about trucks and moving bees , and that being bad , but we &apos;ve done that for thousands of years .
to his left is his student . she &apos;s six .
now i &apos;m going to show you what that does to our societies .
for more than 10 years , people who were charged with my care abused me physically , verbally and sexually .
and this is the project today , 12 years old , still in best condition .
this is a picture of a maternal health clinic in africa — mothers coming , pregnant and with their babies .
but what we want to propose , is that the highest levels of abstraction , things like mathematics , computing , logic , etc . — all of this can be engaged with , not just through purely cerebral algebraic symbolic methods , but by literally , physically playing with ideas .
but there are two in particular that fascinate me .
netflix — they could so easily have been content with earlier generations of distribution , but they always — and i think they will always — keep pushing for the next battle .
the city actually approached us .
and again , going on thinking about this , i realize that in a way we &apos;re all victims of a certain kind of tyranny of the triumph of modernism whereby form and function in an object have to follow one another , or are deemed to do so .
( rumbling ) so right here , these are the motor units that are happening from her spinal cord out to her muscle right here , and as she &apos;s doing it , you &apos;re seeing the electrical activity that &apos;s happening here .
one of the great ironies of modern food systems is that they &apos;ve made the very thing they promised to make easier much harder .
so for example , if someone said , &quot; &quot; my likelihood of suffering from cancer is about 50 percent , &quot; &quot; and we said , &quot; &quot; hey , good news .
but one of them carlos ghosn , ceo of renault and nissan , when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating .
the rest , almost 500,000 people , are dying outside of conflict zones .
you can give yourself your morning pleasures in various languages .

&#91; the &#93; tasmanian devil is found only on the island of tasmania , which is that small island just to the south of the mainland of australia .
and so i wonder if we should just take a leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things .
the challenge here , though , is that the popular men and women are sticking to 97 words on average that are written very , very well , even though it may not seem like it all the time .
the evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species , at particular times of the year .
let me show you some examples .
but , using the language of galois , we can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things are actually the same .
so i don &apos;t know what the balance is , but i think sharks have more right to be fearful of us than we have of them .
i think in some ways , the reason i started the project , even though i didn &apos;t know it at the time , was because i was struggling with my own secrets .
but what does it mean ? how does it impact on our everyday life ?
i mean , in that circumstance , couldn &apos;t you argue that what he did was reasonable ?
you have to be willing to take those risks .
and then we divide it , and this one big piece of dough is divided into smaller units , and each of those units are given shape by the baker .
but the real issue is there &apos;s no food at home .
i didn &apos;t know ted then , but what i did was i closed my eyes tight , and i started dreaming . i could imagine people coming in , dressed up , looking beautiful , my paintings with all the light , and in my visualization i actually saw a very famous actress launching my show , giving credibility to me .
that &apos;s why , when we launched photos on twitter , we made the decision to strip that geodata out .
well , you have to let me say this .
it is , as steven johnson has talked about , an emergent phenomenon .
but i don &apos;t always know the degree to which a changing context ...
if that is true , it leads to some very complicated questions for the london olympics .
it is a structure for maintain , for centuries , by generations , without any department , without any funding , so the secret is &quot; &quot; &#91; unclear &#93; , &quot; &quot; respect .
you can see the united states ahead of everyone else , and much of the economic success of the united states draws on its long-standing advantage as the first mover in education .
so for example , if your date is smiling at you , this technology can help you to determine whether she actually likes you or she is just trying to be nice to you .
imagine being able to — and , again , it &apos;s a templated process , and it solidifies out of a liquid process — imagine being able to have that sort of structure coming out at room temperature .
where do we come up with these ideas ?
twenty-three years ago , at the age of 19 , i shot and killed a man .
so it &apos;s common — don &apos;t expect to be out of here in 10 minutes .
so presently , we are doing the following : first of all , we are decomposing the k-12 math curriculum into numerous such apps .
therefore , ending poverty is simply a matter of delivering proven goods and services to people .
it &apos;s structured , so it ends up being simple to remember , and it &apos;s okay to break it here and there .
they live in groups with a very strict social hierarchy .
we &apos;re born to make a difference .
first rule : there is no clan distinguished and political division in somali society .
what do i mean by these two different forces ?
they bring the medicines up from the pharmacy .
she &apos;s trying to force-feed my camera , which is every photographer &apos;s dream .
saparmurat niyazov , he was one of them .
he &apos;d been expecting me . mohamed had phoned .
but we should be getting out there ourselves and not depending on large institutions to do it for us .
this is the lowland tapir , the tapir species i work with , the largest terrestrial mammal of south america .
and finally , point number three : whatever one wants to say about lesterland , against the background of its history , its traditions , in our land , in usa-land , lesterland is a corruption , a corruption .
it turned out , as i think you could see in aimee &apos;s capabilities and attitudes , people with a desire to do something are quite remarkable and nature is quite adaptable .
i used the three bs of stand-up don &apos;ts as i call them in the middle east : blue content , keep it clean ; beliefs , not religion ; and the third b , bolitics .
so what they did is they — i mean , they put csi to shame here — the internet detectives came out .
( video ) ( laughs ) you are peaceful people .
so the challenge was — i worked for microsoft for a little bit , working on the microsoft barney .
but no , i wasn &apos;t born there .
on the other hand , i didn &apos;t know anything about this . ok ?
and i know how we got here .
and as a result of this program , something &apos;s happening for conservation .
you turn up the dials , the wheel starts to turn .
come the one year anniversary of my journey , i went to see my surgeon , dr. john healey — and by the way , healey , great name for a doctor .
and maybe if we all tried to read our fears , we too would be less often swayed by the most salacious among them .
when we think about working memory , we have to realize that this limited capacity has lots of different impacts on us .
this is why we decided to take the operation undercover when necessary , and use mostly hidden cameras .
was the internet actually a place that you could visit ?
it &apos;s called hutchinson-gilford progeria , and it is the most dramatic form of premature aging .
and when we solve real problems for people , we solve them for the rest of the world at the same time .
am i out of time ? ok .
and when i began looking into these cases , i was wondering , where do these bizarre memories come from ?
that the reason that you want to be below two watts is that &apos;s roughly what you can generate with your upper body .
if your bank account &apos;s one dollar , and you flip a single bit , you could end up with a thousand dollars .
we really have no idea .
i was so determined to be a teacher now so that i could make a difference in my family .
and we can use that same pulse , now applied to the rtpj , to ask if we can change people &apos;s moral judgments .
we , as i &apos;ve said , have got to hit that market , but we &apos;ve got to use our heads rather than our might .
you do some routine refresher training , and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you .
they want to get out .
i was on bowman lake in glacier national park , which is a long , skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it , and my partner and i have a rowing shell .
and we owe a tremendous credit to that .
when they were sick , we would collect specimens from them .
video : now she comes up to dr. sue and starts writing again .
we have a process where we , you know , kind of put it into the computer and digitize it , and then a whole lot of analysis .
of course , the accuracy keeps getting worse .
resurrection is possible .
so they &apos;re all well documented deviations from rational behavior .
i was going to say , i had a great social experience when i went to college that i hadn &apos;t had before , a more fraternal experience , where i met six or seven other guys who i studied physics with , and i was very competitive with them , so then i started to get a &apos;s . but you &apos;re right : i wasn &apos;t an a student .
he realized at once what had happened .
so we were looking at how we could make a power station , that , instead of keeping people out and having a big fence around the outside , could be a place that pulls you in .
so what we have to do , i think , is invent a new kind of agriculture that blends the best ideas of commercial agriculture and the green revolution with the best ideas of organic farming and local food and the best ideas of environmental conservation , not to have them fighting each other but to have them collaborating together to form a new kind of agriculture , something i call &quot; &quot; terraculture , &quot; &quot; or farming for a whole planet .
and those three verses are the core of authenticity .
the battery is not the gas tank , in a sense .
this baby is a human body : it evolved .
one of the reasons is a lot of their telephones use ip protocol and use things like skype and so on that go through the internet right now , and so in fact we &apos;re becoming dependent on it for more and more different things , like when you take off from lax , you &apos;re really not thinking you &apos;re using the internet .
it was that the nobel prize was the tombstone on all great work , and it resonated because i had won 35 out of 36 contests that i &apos;d entered over 11 years , and it made me bananas .
but five years ago , i went on a personal journey .
&quot; &quot; you &apos;ve never really been sure of this , but i can assure you that this quirk you &apos;re so self-conscious of is intensely endearing .
but that is clearly insufficient to address the needs of the people and address the needs of the countries that are supporting the people .
now , pay transparency takes a lot of forms .
and we also have some terrific women who are writing new stories for our kids , and as three-dimensional and delightful as hermione and katniss are , these are still war movies .
this is not about money .
but if you grow up in an area like this , you see affirmative action as a tool to hold people like you back .
so during the chicago mayoral election there was a parody account .
some of you would eat it only if it &apos;s a strangely colored piece of tofu .
if they &apos;re talking about having lost a family member , don &apos;t start talking about the time you lost a family member .
it &apos;s great to be a kid .
so by trying to preserve our dead bodies , we deny death , poison the living and further harm the environment .
audience : now . daniel kish : good . excellent .
and so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open .
it is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult , expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks , and doing that with a local resource , plenty available .
so , we study the holistic health experience of 1,000 seniors over the last 10 years in 20 different countries .
and we call that the meme-ome .
we organized into cities . we had many people .
i can &apos;t feel the wind here , but i just asked one of the caretakers who passed by what it felt like , and she said it felt warm , like melted butter .
( applause )
so production and comprehension rely on very similar processes .
so each chain , or each element , wants to turn right or left .
long steps . so a lot of milongueros — the tango dancers will use very short steps .
to illustrate these mindsets in action , i &apos;m going to take you back to 19th-century france , where this innocuous-looking piece of paper launched one of the biggest political scandals in history .
one way of asking them the question is like this : &quot; &quot; others in similar circumstances have thought about ending their life ; have you had these thoughts ? &quot; &quot; confronting the person head-on may just save their life and be the turning point for them .
so there can be some biologists , psychiatrists , mathematicians , and so on .
this is what the code on your phone looks like , but this is what the code on your computer looks like .
and i lied .
only 18 percent of italians and 15 percent of greeks believe that their vote matters .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard about it — newspapers ?
not just in the streets , but in their homes , at school and at work .
to whom do you speak at least once a week , be it face to face or on facetime ?
i thought that was a pretty big deal .
but the people of the middle east have been deprived of any form of what we know as civic education .
one area is called experimental economics . the other area is called behavioral economics .
and we need preparedness .
and the chinese character for crisis is actually the same side of the same coin .
it is a struggle to try and live a life that is set by the moral codes written in the koran .
i &apos;m not alone , and i am loved .
there is no area of the government — not the epa or the fda — that controls genetically-engineered pets .
and you might be thinking that it was good luck , but it wasn &apos;t .
thank you very much .
that &apos;s it . the task is finished . &quot; &quot; so , now we had a student — an acting student — that was a part of the group .
we want every girl to experience the dance , right ? &quot; &quot; so the girls thought for a moment , and one girl suggested , &quot; why don &apos;t we just take the dance in the jail ? &quot;
we stand today on the threshold of the post-antibiotic era , in the earliest days of a time when simple infections such as the one joe had will kill people once again .
they came up with the very same rules that we had , except they &apos;re theirs .
let me talk about something a little technical for a moment here .
but i don &apos;t want to take responsibility of your emotional baggage .
there was not a flashlight , not a lantern , not a candle — pitch black .
we can tell in the operating room , in the field , at a molecular level , where is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do and how much more work they need to do to cut that out .
what would it look like if there was an easy pathway for the very entrepreneurs and innovators who have disrupted our tech sector to come and disrupt their government ?
when you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms , at first it &apos;s very bizarre .
if you are surrounding yourself with the right people , they will not only get it , they will appreciate it .
but getting this out is one of the things we want to do .
in fact , the winners have to pay their own way to come to the ig nobel ceremony , which most of them do .
that &apos;s where she has to pull herself out from the depths of mortality , come in , release her spirit .
with the patient insensitive to pain , and a sterile operating field all bets were off , the sky was the limit .
of more concern , i think , is the asteroids that exist between mars and jupiter .
first , we need strong health systems in poor countries .
you know , you have new diseases that require new drugs .
we &apos;ve got to start thinking about asking people to retire a little bit later .
is there a way to know ?
( laughter ) ( video ) : ninety .
it was an act of kindness .
i had fun again , i worked harder and , to cut a long story short , did all the things that took me back up to success .
i imagine a whole world of surrogate donors from all walks of life , different sizes , different ages , coming together in this voice drive to give people voices that are as colorful as their personalities .
so , we &apos;ve become one of the hot , young jazz recording studios in the united states of america ( laughter ) in the middle of the inner city with a high crime rate .
listen to this : less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treated stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment .
but i think it &apos;s insane to believe that we will ever make a society that is genuinely meritocratic ; it &apos;s an impossible dream .
i want to quote this guy — the guy in robes , not the other guy — the dalai lama , who said , &quot; &quot; if you want others to be happy , practice compassion .
and this material that &apos;s deposited either starts as a liquid form or a material powder form .
but look what happened in europe after the plague : rising wages , land reform , technological innovation , birth of the middle class ; and after that , forward-looking social movements like the renaissance , and later the enlightenment .
or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere .
look what happened by 2000 to the average call .
and they actually lived another 14 days , or 28 when we finally killed them , and took them apart and figured out what went wrong .
this proved that anonymous and this idea can rally the masses from the keyboards to the streets , and it laid the foundations for dozens of future operations against perceived injustices to their online and offline world .
not so much different from us , they can use plants to treat their intestinal parasites .
evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment .
just think of people at a checkout line or at a red light .
and so the citizen scientists , when they saw this , they notified the science team that they found something weird enough that it might be worth following up .
it turns out that women are really driving the social media revolution .
that would be very boring .
in fact , i am a data nerd .
one of the key qualities of all stories is that they &apos;re made to be shared .

in fact — ( applause ) thank you .
and you know what my response to all of that is ?
( laughter ) it &apos;s all i got . ( laughs ) so , in this suburb , the poo and the pee and the wash water are going to this treatment plant right in the middle of the community .
under normal sentencing procedures , judge russell would have had little choice but to sentence pettengill to serious jail-time as a drug felon .

( laughter ) summer vacations often consisted of my father trying to heal me , so i drank deer &apos;s milk , i had hot cups on my back , i was dunked in the dead sea , and i remember the water burning my eyes and thinking , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s working ! it &apos;s working ! &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) but one miracle cure we did find was yoga .
let &apos;s hear what jeff han has to say about this newfangled technology .
and then finally , there &apos;s how the system can handle uncertainty .
the effect of this has been that , within the first year , we really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served , which is over 50,000 people .
mcintyre wrote about this and it was read by the editor of high times magazine .
they were screaming .
now , when john f. kennedy sent a man to the moon and decided to bring him back , or decided to do both those things , he didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; hey , whenever you guys get to it . &quot; &quot; he gave us a deadline .
time for development — it took around 10 years and 700 million dollars .
i think all schools could use extra equipment , extra cash — it &apos;s going to be an incentive for them to do that .
perhaps even worse is when it finds its way into our oceans , like in the great plastic gyre , where these materials are being mechanically broken into smaller and smaller bits , but they &apos;re not really going away .
that &apos;s quite a lot .
our instinct as parents is to order our kids around .
as a little girl , i always imagined i would one day run away .
it just came on the scene three years ago .
why do we dance together ?
and the great thing is there &apos;s no trick like with the glass ceiling .
in fact , no , education spending should not be cut .
so one approach we ’ re taking is to try to design drugs that function like molecular scotch tape , to hold the protein into its proper shape .
what rises twice a year , once in easter and then two weeks before christmas , has a mini peak every monday , and then flattens out over the summer ?
maybe it &apos;s going to rain .
i mean , we want to build frameworks in a way that makes it acceptable and makes it productive down the road .
and this is a little bit freaky , because what motts is seeing is actually this .
in theory , this means we could restore hundreds of native species that have been pushed to the brink .
i signed up for something called the personal genome project .
you want button fly or zipper fly ? you want stonewashed or acid-washed ?
we developed a theory called &quot; &quot; dragon-kings . &quot; &quot; dragon-kings represent extreme events which are of a class of their own .
reclaiming yourself can be one of the most gorgeous acts of self-love and can look like a million different things , from hairstyles to tattoos to body contouring to hormones to surgery and yes , even weight loss .
karl marx saw this as the tragedy of capitalism , the alienation of the worker from the product of his labor .
and i &apos;m not suggesting that we do , but the bottom line is , we &apos;ve always had alternatives .
and that needs to be recognized , first of all , that peacekeeping works .
for example , the incarceration rate , the prison population in this country has quadrupled since 1980 .
you &apos;re not supposed to rip off the shark or the monster .
check ignition and may god &apos;s love be with you .

he said , &quot; &quot; i am a scrap of a man , but if you help me , i &apos;m ready to do anything , even if i have to crawl on the ground . &quot; &quot; and then he sat down .
i &apos;m thrilled to be here .
so half the earth &apos;s internet population is using facebook .
if you &apos;re going to look for where the change is happening , you have to look on the margins .
and we &apos;ve studied this on a whole slew of different political issues .
they are expecting to create little , tiny black holes .

i &apos;m a global citizen .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super sex . &quot;
thanks so much , chris . cu : thank you . ( applause )
( laughter ) eh : i want to talk about your work .
or maybe your brother-in-law who doesn &apos;t believe in global warming .
and i &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; didn &apos;t we just go through this last year ? &quot; &quot; but i &apos;m going to pick the one that interests me most , and that is the completed marriage of the cell phone and the internet .
it &apos;s things like androstenol , androstenone or androstadienone .
we tell them we &apos;ll see them in 18 years , and getting there is kind of on them .
so that &apos;s a ship .
i washed my face with this this morning in preparation for this .
the anger in me against corruption made me to make a big career change last year , becoming a full-time practicing lawyer .
further advances came when the team removed the restriction enzyme genes from the recipient capricolum cell .
ca : and so , and that windmill , what — it worked ?
dendritic cells , or macrophages , capture the virus and display pieces of it .
and secondly , where did the leprosy bacteria come from ?
and every culture comes up with its own understanding of life , its own customized version of mythology .
the doorbell rang and it was a trick-or-treater dressed as my character . it was so cool .
and because the probability of me throwing it just right is very low , given everybody watching me , what we &apos;re going to do instead is show you a video that we shot last night .
chaz ebert : it was chaz who stood by my side through three attempts to reconstruct my jaw and restore my ability to speak .
cryptocurrencies can be used for illegal transactions , just like cash is used for crime in the world today .
okay , now the question is really , why is this so ?
we also talked about the white shark cafe .
so those folks in new mexico — why did they do it ?
and to tell you a bit about the things that i make , the easiest place to start the story is with a hat .
in the case of the indus script , the problem is the reverse .
but that &apos;s not right .
and really , this is the reason i came here tonight .
so this should really be seen at home with you typing in your own address , but i &apos;m going to give you a little preview of what you can expect .
and for me , the sound of a steel guitar , because one of my parents &apos; neighbors just gave me one of these things .
there are over 500,000 local and state offices in america .
if there is only one machine , and our little handhelds and devices are actually just little windows into those machines , but that we &apos;re basically constructing a single , global machine .
president obama has got the red carpet , he goes down air force one , and it feels pretty good , it feels pretty comfortable .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
it &apos;s essentially like he &apos;s extending his skin up there , far away .
ok . now , children get their ideas not from teachers , as teachers often think , but actually from common sense , from experience of the world around them , from all the things that go on between them and their peers , and their carers , and their parents , and all of that . experience .
this is where we stand today .
none of these techniques result in any amount of recycling in any significant way .
we live in the post-sampling era .
and drew barrymore , for all her wonderful charm , is not glamorous either .
we brought it into the rover , we tasted it , and guess what ?
we &apos;re at last starting to debate this issue , and the benefits that are available for designing for the ears in education , unbelievable .
these pictures mean more to me than you know .
but the human brain — ( laughter ) the human brain always triumphs , and indeed , in the united states today , 86 percent of americans will marry by age 49 .
and we as citizens , as we go through this experience of the kind of , the crisis of confidence , crisis of competence , crisis of legitimacy , i think there &apos;s a temptation to pull back from the world and say , ah , katrina , iraq — we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re doing .
and it &apos;s not a special effects film ; it has to be a man .
now it &apos;s 11 : 00 pm in rio .
but if you take that logic , you know , you should consider life unfair , because the test of truth in life is not whether we can remember what we learned in school , but whether we are prepared for change , whether we are prepared for jobs that haven &apos;t been created , to use technologies that haven &apos;t been invented , to solve problems we just can &apos;t anticipate today .
as many of you are aware , the world of academia is a rather inward-looking one .
how the heck could they be &#91; a &#93; developing country ?

when i entered prison , i was bitter , i was angry , i was hurt .
try and build a political settlement first .
and you see this teenager running down a street , and then you see google street view and google maps imagery and you realize the street he &apos;s running down is yours .
moreover , today , more than half of the world &apos;s population live in cities .
and my grandchildren and everyone else will .
if you climb these three , six steps you will find something very nice .
the canneries are gone . the pollution has abated .
neither can attack the other , because to attack the other side you &apos;ve got to come down the mountain into the valley and then up the other side , and you &apos;re completely exposed .
so we have created a very disruptive structure which mimics the design of bone , or a skeleton , which occurs in nature .
much of the road congestion in and out of our cities will disappear .
on up to iceland .
i don ’ t know of any other submersible , or even remote , that just takes advantage that this is a three-dimensional space .
here on the model you see the predator attacking .
i &apos;m talking about losing it in the same way that we lost the dinosaurs : actually losing it , never to be seen again .
here &apos;s what most of the sand in our world looks like .
bassem was a good swimmer , so he held her hand and tread water .
i came mainly to be reunited with my family and to reconnect in a way that i found my place in the society .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
so was mars habitable ?
and he went back to them , and they agreed to do another 10 .
it &apos;s not because she is stupid or he is stupid .
it &apos;s especially important now .
i &apos;m going to argue tonight that compassion and the golden rule are , in a certain sense , built into human nature .
this is a measurement we obtained a few years ago from a mars-orbiting satellite called odyssey .
for anyone here from brazil , you &apos;ll know about this plant .
the publication of those images , as opposed to the images themselves , caused a government to change its policies .
we see it as terrorism versus democracy in that brand war .
this is a bit shocking , because in fact our government is relying on that for us to meet kyoto , and do all those kind of things .
and i use that sort of technology to create things that are quite beautiful .
our credit scores have helped us deliver over 200,000 loans in kenya in just the past year .
but there are more important things that are already occurring : embryo screening .
let &apos;s talk about dna analysis in space .
we &apos;ve used it to bring people face to face and connect them with each other , building real relationships and supporting people to find work .
and i &apos;ve done this in three parts .
the years went by and the princess grew up into a beautiful young woman , who whistled even more beautifully . ( whistling )
what ought we to be studying ?
worldwide , over 1.5 billion people experience armed conflict .
abed said that i should call back in a few weeks , and when i did , and a recording told me that his number was disconnected , i let abed and the crash go .
everything that is allowed , every configuration that is allowed to be obtained by the molecules in this room , would eventually be obtained .
and then the process on shore takes around three or four days , and then , when it &apos;s done , they put the manhole cover back on top , and they push the sand over that , and we all forget about it .
we like our suffering because it &apos;s so good when it ceases for a while . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) this is what i see from the balcony of my hermitage in the himalayas .
while we humans , we are happy in our comfort zone , these plants also need their ecosystem to be preserved , and they don &apos;t react — endemic plants don &apos;t react to very harsh changes in their ecosystem , and yet we know what are the challenges that climate change , for example , is posing to these plants .
my funeral home sells a few caskets made out of things like woven willow and bamboo , but honestly , most of our families just choose a simple shroud .
165 .
now hold your breath , not too long , to imagine what comes next .
i &apos;d say , watch any successful well-written , family-friendly sitcom in the west for your answers .
that &apos;s actually not so bad . if you go back to the carter and even reagan administrations , they were rating the other party 43 , 45 . it &apos;s not terrible .
getting the cause and the effect right makes all the difference in the world .
( applause )
and what we &apos;re doing with them is taking a traditional race-car chassis and giving it a nervous system .
what &apos;s your hope / depression level on this ?
we need to get away from feeling , in the same way , human rights matters because of the other things it brings , or women &apos;s rights matters for the other things it brings .
and i started to fall .
and you &apos;re kind of trapped in the texture of kymaerica .
as a result , they can &apos;t improve on others &apos; ideas or learn from others &apos; mistakes — benefit from others &apos; wisdom .
truly extraordinary altruists &apos; compassion extends way beyond that circle , even beyond their wider circle of acquaintances to people who are outside their social circle altogether , total strangers , just like the man who rescued me .
we have .
there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors . thanks .
and i think we can go and use our technology to go and digitize things , put them on the net , and then download , print them and bind them , and end up with books again .
any event that happens anywhere in the world , i should be able to know about it pretty much instantaneously , as it happens , for free .
and how much will they pay for this ?
and it &apos;s not based on theology or philosophy , it &apos;s in the study of the mind , across all these spheres of research , from neuroscience to the cognitive scientists , behavioral economists , psychologists , sociology , we &apos;re developing a revolution in consciousness .
all right ? anybody else like that , no ?
that &apos;s it , thank you .
100 years later .
i can &apos;t tell you when this will start , because i don &apos;t want my competition to know my schedule .
so the oyster was the basis for a manifesto-like urban design project that i did about the new york harbor called &quot; &quot; oyster-tecture . &quot; &quot; and the core idea of oyster-tecture is to harness the biological power of mussels , eelgrass and oysters — species that live in the harbor — and , at the same time , harness the power of people who live in the community towards making change now .
like one of the ways to understand our greenhouse future is to drill down in time to the last period where we had co2 double what it is today .
he &apos;s not quite a child , and he &apos;s not quite a man .
that &apos;s a very powerful idea , and it &apos;s a very powerful reality .
so i just lifted my face up from the manuscript and i directed my comments to an empty corner of the room .
i didn &apos;t know what was the war for .
good news : chariot &apos;s coming . good news : chariot &apos;s coming .
and after a few years , you can remove some of those shade trees .
embarrassed , the animals fled , and that was the last time they revealed themselves this way .
and if you were going to fight orcs on the fields of mordor against the ra &apos;s al ghul , you &apos;d probably want to be the bigger one , right ?
but along with the scientific challenge and the economic challenge , there &apos;s also a cultural challenge , and this is probably the part about malaria that people don &apos;t like to talk about .
so what is happening ?
right around d-day , bonica showed up to madigan army medical center , near tacoma .
here &apos;s the mystery , then : how do we actually make these polymer chains inside the brain so we can move all the biomolecules apart ?
now it &apos;s a little bit of a surprise that to get an answer to that question , we have to go to tool use in the chimpanzees .
we said : if we take the top hundred companies , what percentage of all 15 commodities do they touch , buy or sell ?
preach technology to all the twittering members of all the iranian demonstrations who are now in political prison in tehran , where ahmadinejad remains in power .
what is raveling ? you see that in this road that the stones at the surface come off .
you can see on the pottery and the baskets .
we didn &apos;t — a lot of flying , a lot of experiments , a lot of things that didn &apos;t work , and ones that did work , and the plane kept getting a little better , a little better .
and i love my country , and i &apos;m not going to fail that . i &apos;m not going to fail that .
so let me just end with a couple of scenarios .
it &apos;s a start .
whoosh . okay .
here &apos;s koko with her kitten .
i want to stress , you know , social organization can transcend political bounds .
that &apos;s what we do .
some of it is controlled , like music or theater , but most of it is chaotic and incoherent , which some of us refer to as noise .
you don &apos;t learn how to hold two things just from the fluff , you learn it from the grit .
it &apos;s a death sentence .
all they had was mike &apos;s hard lemonade , which was five percent alcohol .
the human brain also seems special in the amount of energy that it uses .
the brain is a bit of a hog when it comes to using glucose .
familiarity destroys and trumps fear . try it .
dj : so at this stage , i guess , we had very , very firm ideas on what conservation meant .
but we only looked at a handful of individuals at this point .
( applause )
we need to somehow get their message to the policymakers .
we ride the elevator up and we crawl in , on your hands and knees into the spaceship , one at a time , and you worm your way up into your chair and plunk yourself down on your back .
he was wrong .
and third , it had to be what amitabha calls infinitely expandable .
or worse , about to sue them . and so i went through — ( laughter ) right ? i went through my entire business career , and never spoke about being a woman , never spoke about it publicly .
but as early as 1968 , this visionary man , robert kennedy , at the start of his ill-fated presidential campaign , gave the most eloquent deconstruction of gross national product that ever has been .
it &apos;s also the great theoretical triumph of biology .
but this time , i was the patient .
and this work corrects that bias in our culture , that dehumanizing bias .
a single cave system , like mammoth cave , which is in kentucky , can be as long as more than 600 kilometers .
mahmood ali balogun : i think filmmaking in nigeria , for those who work in it , is a kind of subsistence filmmaking — what they do to make a living .
♪ sending out an s.o.s. ♪ come on now .
jp : no not at all . i &apos;m having a great day with the kids .
they asked the fbi to go to congress and make the case .
almost anybody who &apos;s looked at well-run organizations has come to pretty much the same conclusion .
the unforgivable shit i would do to her . &quot; &quot; online misogyny is a global gender rights tragedy , and it is imperative that it ends .
for the hundred or so countries that are ranked below china , more than half of them are electoral democracies .
i didn &apos;t know who she was , and she said , &quot; &quot; did you get george abbott to talk ? &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; yeah . apparently i did . &quot; &quot; and she said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m his old girlfriend , maureen stapleton , and i could never do it . &quot; &quot; and then she made me go up with the tape of it and prove that george abbott actually could talk .
he wrote that , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radical acts like the brain of one of the lower animals . &quot; &quot; this is not a metaphor .
face 2 face demonstrated that what we thought impossible was possible — and , you know what , even easy .
on october 7 , he calls his cousin in belgium , and explains his situation .
so what does it mean to design at a global scale ?
what i &apos;m going to do is look at five categories of experiments , each of which challenges an old assumption of philanthropy .
and she doesn &apos;t know when it &apos;s going to be available again .
modeling , they tried modeling all the time . they were always modeling things .
do you hear me ? do you hear me ?
so nice , all week . he &apos;s the kind of man you could say to , &quot; &quot; chris , i &apos;m really sorry , i &apos;ve crashed your car .
so , an interpreter of what ? of a piece of music , right ?
we look in cortical areas that control specific movements , and the sequences of movements that are required in the behavior , and so forth .
how do you know ?
i was surrounded by extraordinary women in my life : grandmothers , teachers , aunts , cousins , neighbors , who taught me about quiet strength and dignity .
we were totally dependent during those years on this amazing acronym , which is mad .
the rest of you , you will grow older and you will get two billion children .
they &apos;ve funded research that shows that we can double global palm oil production without cutting a single tree in the next 20 years , and do it all in borneo alone by planting on land that &apos;s already degraded .
we can track these changes , and have tracked these changes in many such behaviors across time .
so , clearly , we were in a substantially better place for this .
they &apos;re probably going to be angry , depressed , frustrated .
and one of the things i really like about gardening is that it doesn &apos;t take all your concentration , you really can &apos;t get hurt — it &apos;s not like woodworking — and you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation .
and here &apos;s what i found : most people are worrying about the wrong thing .
so let me just explain to you that the smartest man ever was a scotsman .
dysmorphophobia is a perversion of this where people who may be very good looking regard themselves as hideously ugly and are constantly seeking surgery to correct their facial appearance .
this is the first experiment that we did — eight year-old boy on your right teaching his student , a six year-old girl , and he was teaching her how to browse .
i &apos;ve heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet is the adolescent male .
so the next time you find yourself in a pitch-black closet clutching your grenade , know we have all been there before .
the color represents different rooms they are in the house .
so it turns out the two species were interdependent , like yin and yang .
sometimes i get little old ladies from the seventh day adventist church showing me these cartoon pictures of heaven .
that &apos;s the place to be .
i &apos;m going to talk to you now about the elephant rather than the camel in the room .
yeah , so seeds that could save your life . you know ?
i &apos;m watching who &apos;s watching me .
you know , the spanish didn &apos;t sink the battleship maine , the lusitania was not an innocent vessel but was loaded with munitions , the north vietnamese did not attack the seventh fleet , and , of course , saddam hussein hated al qaeda and had nothing to do with it , and yet the administration convinced 45 percent of the people that they were brothers in arms , when he would hang one from the nearest lamppost .
and when i came back , i had to give them a lot of gratitude and praise because they showed me that they truly had my back and that they truly had their own backs .
it &apos;s like the old maxim of &quot; &quot; you can tell somebody something and show them , but if they do it they really learn it . &quot; &quot; here is another thing you can do .
we had heard this story about lost gold from a gold rush-era robbery , and we wanted to go up there .
now i &apos;m going to close with a video that is kind of unusual .
her spanish was great because she was from mexico .
so , you can kind of get an idea from this extrapolating that back under this huge picture , so we get this idea of what the primal universe looked like .
for decades , workers with a high school degree have been denied a fair share of what they have produced .
if you have any videos of yourself , three or four years ago , you probably feel embarrassed because you don &apos;t recognize yourself .
hyperbolic overkill is a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit , just for the fun of it . this was a piece i did — a brochure again — &quot; rms tyrannic : the biggest thing in all the world . &quot;
we could test the safety of chemicals that we are exposed to on a daily basis in our environment , such as chemicals in regular household cleaners .
the first thought is that , hey , you know there &apos;s somebody somewhere out there playing some music , and this is a small but i think important human connection to make that perhaps the technology affords .
would you describe that as global citizenship ?
taiwan succeeded , china under mao zedong didn &apos;t .
here are three sets of firing patterns . the top one is from a normal animal , the middle one is from a blind animal that &apos;s been treated with this encoder-transducer device , and the bottom one is from a blind animal treated with a standard prosthetic .
here &apos;s another one : &quot; &quot; sorry i didn &apos;t respond to you earlier .
and so i asked jawad , &quot; &quot; how do you guys navigate ? this is a really diverse community .
is this just an interesting mathematical structure that might be able to explain some previously unexplained features of the world , or can we actually test for these extra dimensions ?
or languages have different word orders .
what did we want from each other ?
and if you reach back into the dark corners of your memory , you might remember something like what i felt when my grandfather died and when i realized it could happen to me too , that sense that behind all of this the void is waiting .
( applause )
they held my mouth and dragged me out of the stadium , where they thoroughly beat me up and locked me up in jail .
and for those of you that don &apos;t have that authority : it &apos;s time to stand up for your right to .
i &apos;ve lost all faith in the media — a hapless joke i would much rather laugh at than become a part of .
the problem is that we have these color-tinted glasses as we look at all kinds of situations .
thank you .
and as adults , we &apos;re certainly not alone .
i believe at this time we need a moratorium .
again , it &apos;s perfectly safe for people . it puts out the fires , doesn &apos;t hurt anything .
if not , well , this is the hardest problem perhaps in science and philosophy .
it listens to the lecture , and then it uses the amplitude of each word to move a point on the x-axis , and it uses the inflection of sentences to move a same point up and down on the y-axis .
transistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen , and technology has really benefitted from that .
if you want to change the world , you have to group together , you have to be collaborative .
you &apos;ll see that this is exactly the same condition , only in the no-director condition they just have to remember to apply this somewhat arbitrary rule , whereas in the director condition , they have to remember to take into account the director &apos;s perspective in order to guide their ongoing behavior .
this is why politics is so tribal .
we &apos;re going to need individuals of all ages , from the young to the old , and with all different shapes and sizes of the autism spectrum disorder to make sure that we can have an impact .
one is a little larger , it maybe also has a few tricks in the exact way it &apos;s wired .
he created this experiment that is used in many other experiments in behavioral science .
but under the surface was a very different reality .
it turns out , miguel spent the better part of his career in the mikumi national park in africa .
they don &apos;t shy away from infrastructure .
it &apos;s in spite of doctors , not because of doctors .
now , unfortunately , there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly .
so governments from russia to china to iran are actually hiring , training and paying bloggers in order to leave ideological comments and create a lot of ideological blog posts to comment on sensitive political issues . right ?
they believe juniper smoke is holy .
they rock the mic outside my window every morning .

but i got a phone call from bono in 1985 and , as you know , he &apos;s a great singer , but he &apos;s a magnificent hustler , and — ( laughter ) — a very hard guy to say no to , and he was saying , you know , just after i &apos;d done the biko song , we &apos;re going to do a tour for amnesty , you have to be on it , and really that was the first time that i &apos;d been out and started meeting people who &apos;d watched their family being shot in front of them , who &apos;d had a partner thrown out of an airplane into an ocean , and suddenly this world of human rights arrived in my world ,
we pay for it in our taxes on april 15th .
tracey gamley stepped up to give me the impossible kidney that i was never supposed to have .
down the road , there was another building , a nice visual structure : horizontal , vertical elements , little decorative lines going across , these magenta squiggles , the workmen being reduced to decorative elements , just a nice , kind of , breakup of the urban place .
and when we made a solution of this , tagged with the fluorescence and injected in the body of a mouse , their nerves literally glowed .
so they built the buildings and then they waited a few months for the paths to form .
eventually , hasbro themselves invited me to their headquarters so they could go and unveil their new easy-bake oven product to me in black , silver and blue .
we begin to go on the hill and lobby .
these are called minimization procedures .
third , i work at an enormously supportive workplace at usc law school .
so however we do it ...
we want to be able to build technological artifacts that are maybe good for the world .
but my clearest and sharpest memory of my auntie , is also one of my first memories of life at all .
thank you . ( applause ) ( applause ) thank you very much . ( applause )
and i &apos;ll tell you why we need to change it , but we absolutely have to change it .
let &apos;s go back to that time , to this city .
ur : i &apos;d never learned it before , but he told me that we would be playing that on stage , so i was familiar with it , so that &apos;s why i had so much more fun learning it .
now you might recognize this one .
a little rarer are the fallstreak holes . all right ?
julian treasure : i call this the mixer .
bg : now what about the money ?
certainly not good for the police department .
as : so how do you make a selfish character likable ?
in every case , they got the weapons before they got the nuclear power .
of diamonds , correct ? ( audience : no . ) lg : yes ?
it was then that abed resumed at once the tale of woe he had begun over the phone 16 years before .
how did we get so information poor and how can we do better ?
so i decided to start a lawsuit against them , because i wanted to have this information .
and we have the elves in the form of china .
poster for atlantic center for the arts , a school in florida .
the teachers always say , well , it &apos;s fine , but it &apos;s too expensive for what it does .
find an artist or a writer — or , heaven forbid , find a philosopher and talk to them .
( applause ) let &apos;s talk about film now .
so , 16 inmates and 18 girls were invited .
here &apos;s just a symbolic picture of that .
they &apos;re busting through obstacles .
jk : we still had this idea of the hill , though .
so , if we want to track something that was spreading through a network , what we ideally would like to do is to set up sensors on the central individuals within the network , including node a , monitor those people that are right there in the middle of the network , and somehow get an early detection of whatever it is that is spreading through the network .
when my schedule ends , mira briefly shows me how i progressed throughout my session .
their acuity — our acuity is 20 / 20 ; babies &apos; acuity is like 20 / 800 , so they are looking at the world in a very , very blurry fashion .
we all internalize it from a very early age without even having a language for what we &apos;re doing .
and it &apos;s not a banal story — after the liberation he continued to make false papers until the &apos; 70s .
i love contemporary art , but i &apos;m often really frustrated with the contemporary art world and the contemporary art scene .
you may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there but you know to demand it .
we &apos;re ready , because today we have the technology to gather and analyze data in ways that would have been unimaginable to kuznets .
the music &apos;s half of me , but the other half — i landed probably the best gig of all .
and it &apos;s serving 52,000 villages , which represent about 80 million people .
the book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape dictionaries come in . and it &apos;s not going to be the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in .
funny , that .
using molecular engineering , we can actually design a superweapon that can travel through the bloodstream .
eventually i decided , if i was going to end up in prison , i &apos;d better end up on the right side of the bars , so i thought i &apos;d check it out , take a tour of the place my dad worked , the mcneil island penitentiary .
but first , i have to explain why they &apos;re important because vaccines , the power of them , is really like a whisper .
what about bigger numbers ?
imagine an immersive system that permits to go and dive and reconstruct the venice of a given year , some experience you could share within a group .
but there was something really exciting , because i could see at a distance the tv channels covering it , and they had these big vans and the teams and the cameras , and i was basically doing the same thing and all i had was a backpack .
i see that you &apos;re clutching a teddy bear , etc . , etc .
you can have an amazing shot of atrocity , but if you can &apos;t verify it , it &apos;s worth nothing .
now , why am i telling you this story at this meeting ?
it &apos;s a little paper chip .
you end up like some kind of rabid windmill .
come with me .
i actually don &apos;t say this in despair .
very simple .
( applause )
and based on this , people have calculated that the number of permutations and combinations of brain activity exceeds the number of elementary particles in the universe .
it gets worse than that — or perhaps better than that .
a few years ago , after finishing my ph.d. in london , i moved to boston .
and i &apos;m also inspired by the actions that i &apos;m seeing older people taking in service of this movement .
we are committed to making sure that all our agricultural raw materials are sourced from sustainable sources , 100-percent sustainable sources .
what i want to do this afternoon is something a little different than what &apos;s scheduled .
so , it makes one wonder , &quot; &quot; why is it there ? &quot; &quot; i mean , why is there that stop sign in each direction ?
the cmus also include some non-muslim prisoners .
like , now you can do whatever you want , like , you gotta get on with that .
and if we can eventually get good solar in space , that also could help .
fourteen americans die each day from asthma , three times what it was in the &apos; 90s , and it &apos;s almost all coming from car exhaust .
but it &apos;s going to work . it &apos;s more effective than just computational aids .
like this pattern of pulses here actually means &quot; &quot; baby &apos;s face , &quot; &quot; and so when the brain gets this pattern of pulses , it knows that what was out there was a baby &apos;s face , and if it got a different pattern it would know that what was out there was , say , a dog , or another pattern would be a house .
so sometimes fear can produce a constructive response .
but also because the content was very close .
this diagram on the right shows a very beautiful compilation of studies suggesting indeed that there is a nonlinear — possibility for a nonlinear transition just in the next few decades .
and what we found — we thought , these are the older people who are going to be really interested in this program .
unlike , say , a traditional maker of shoes or cabinets , the worker in an industrial factory has no control , no pleasure , and no true satisfaction or understanding in her own work .
one of the most dramatic manifestations of these improvements will be moving from population pyramids to what we might term population coffins .
we &apos;re trying to process so much stuff that some people get synesthetic and just have huge pipes that remember everything .
there &apos;s a about a tenfold difference there , log scale up the side .
there &apos;s — no reactor &apos;s been even built to an old design , much less a new one , in the united states for 25 years .
we so rarely note how different it is from moment to moment , with clouds coming and going .
i &apos;ve got a hydro conversion at a watermill that i own .
autonomous robotic weapons concentrate too much power in too few hands , and they would imperil democracy itself .
for instance , i took them skiing in the mid-atlantic range , which is this range of mountains in the middle of the atlantic .
so online dating is the second most popular way that people now meet each other , but as it turns out , algorithms have been around for thousands of years in almost every culture .
but if you look in nature , you see that different kinds of animals can have really different lifespans .
and i think that &apos;s much better , that kind of control would be much better as a drug .
think about that for a minute .
i don &apos;t know if you have this , but in britain we have two major political parties .
all of quality control , which has had a major impact on industrial processing , is underpinned by statistics .
and how would that change the experience for the patient ?
i don &apos;t know for sure that the brits invented this particular view of the world , but i suspect we might have done so : we are right in the middle , and we &apos;ve cut the pacific in half and flung it to the far corners of the world .
and crazy as it may sound , i believe we can revive the joy of voting .
these are different wars , with different religious factions , different political factions , and different socioeconomic problems .
the mushrooms then are harvested , but very importantly , the mycelium has converted the cellulose into fungal sugars .
and that &apos;s why we can tell the emotion of somebody else — because their muscles are acting , subconsciously , except that we &apos;ve evolved to make the facial muscles really rich with emotion .
here &apos;s an example from hong kong , where some kids made a game and then built their own physical interface device and had a light sensor , so the light sensor detects the hole in the board , so as they move the physical saw , the light sensor detects the hole and controls the virtual saw on the screen and saws down the tree .
and luckily for us , we live in a time where we &apos;re incredibly good at capturing information about ourselves .
well , a lot .
what if we created a private sector challenge to the governors ?
so , she &apos;ll make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys , with african material mixed in . very creative designs , has reached a stage where she even had an order from wal-mart .
these are the ayatollahs , mostly based in qom , who have great clout in the religious community , have been quiet on politics and are going to be getting louder , because they see iran going in an unhealthy direction , a direction contrary to what khomeini had in mind .
it can be wonder .
so maybe you get into things like high-powered lasers or tugging using nets or tethers , as crazy as those sound in the short term .
one of the things that defines a tedster is you &apos;ve taken your passion , and you &apos;ve turned it into stewardship .
and if you look at this tree again within the african context , in west africa , it &apos;s known as the palaver tree , because it performs great social functions .
and from these kinds of serial electron microscopy slices , one can start to make reconstructions in 3d of neurons that look like these .
i want you to imagine that the girl is a chip in the huge macrocosm of collective consciousness .
what was interesting is , by videotaping on a bus , they were able to produce exactly what people on their smartphones were typing , and then they had a surprising result , which is that their software had not only done it for their target , but other people who accidentally happened to be in the picture , they were able to produce what those people had been typing , and that was kind of an accidental artifact of what their software was doing .
this is getting ready for the monsoon in bombay , india .
the devil is in me , court .
this is a donated japanese atom incubator that we found in a nicu in kathmandu .
i got a ferocious sore throat two days later .
when does the learning process begin ? does it begin in first grade ?
you hear it all the time .
the mother came to me , knelt down , and said , &quot; &quot; leymah , take my daughter .
what ? did we do this ? really ? does anyone do this ?
now , recently i &apos;ve been told i &apos;ve been taking the high road .
and i said , &quot; &quot; kids , really quickly — i woke up this morning , i decided i wanted to be able to jump over a house — nothing too big , two or three stories — but , if you could think of any animal , any superhero , any cartoon character , anything you can dream up right now , what kind of legs would you build me ? &quot; &quot; and immediately a voice shouted , &quot; &quot; kangaroo ! &quot; &quot; &quot; no , no , no ! should be a frog ! &quot;
and this reminds me of something i understand lord salisbury said to queen victoria over a hundred years ago , when she was pressing him , &quot; &quot; please change . &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; change ?
it was fun . that was pretty much it .
( music ) panbanisha is trying to give nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors .
even worse , what if blaming the obese means we &apos;re blaming the victims ?
but look in the southern hemisphere .
there were enormous differences between kids who resisted and kids who yielded , in many ways .
and hold onto this . good luck to you .
population growth will mainly occur among the poorest people here because they have high child mortality and they have many children per woman .
and if we have b , a , g , f , what do we expect next ?
they , the woodpeckers , typically will peck , they will bang their head on a piece of wood thousands of times every day . every day !
well , anne frank touched millions with her powerful account of the holocaust .
( applause )
and so you can see here , old-fashioned technology of the paintbrush being applied .
and we &apos;re going to read to you . &quot; &quot; a child who has not been read to is in danger when that child gets to school .
how can we apply this knowledge ?
so it &apos;s not just my father that i &apos;ve imitated .
and you describe it , gabby , over and over , as deeper on so many levels . yes ?
she is on the taliban &apos;s hit list .
where is it ? there &apos;s no way — kt : ( beep ) kt : oh , my god !
as you know , when you put oil and water together , they don &apos;t mix , but through self-assembly we can get a nice oil droplet to form , and we can actually use this as a body for our artificial organism or for our protocell , as you will see later .
and the pattern of these interactions determines whether the ant comes back out , and what it does when it comes back out .
i had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak , looking like the michelin man .
we &apos;re moving into this future where the factory is everywhere , and increasingly that means that the design team is everyone .
this work is called xia gang ( &quot; &quot; leaving post &quot; &quot; ) .
i can tell you , even if you have ten ph.ds. , you can never beat bill gates in understanding the computer industry .
they &apos;re smart .
each time you &apos;re closer , it gets bigger , down to very , very small distances .
so it was a moment in time where all of these startups had to sit and think and got really excited about what they could be .
so , stepping down out of the bus , i headed back to the corner to head west en route to a braille training session .
college ended and i returned to jerusalem for a year .
look at zanesville , ohio .
( laughter ) and especially if it &apos;s kind of interesting books that you care about , in languages that you can read .
and yet , we all rejected this project , none of the donors was willing to have their name connected with it , and it was the first project to be implemented .
so we &apos;re asking for human artifice to become a living thing , and we want growth , we want free energy from sunlight and we want an open metabolism for chemicals .
the thing that &apos;s special about it is this modular targeting system .
just as water drops come together to form oceans , i believe that we all must come together when tackling this global problem .
as you remember , cindy gallop said men don &apos;t know the difference between making love and doing porn .
and the chords , it turned out , were capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions .
and the person walks up to me , and says , &quot; &quot; hi , my name is so-and-so .
what &apos;s more important is that they all seem to share the same ability to implement a process that transforms their assistance , transforms the way they practice medicine .
even if we borrow just a fraction of its ability to tolerate radiation , it would be infinitely better than what we already have , which is just the melanin in our skin .
almost all of these are not only small , they are proliferation-proof .
ultimately , there &apos;s a quantum level where we have to delve into this weirdness .
and about four or five months ago , he underwent an experimental procedure .
it &apos;s very easy to adopt .
so we &apos;ve talked a lot about facial appearance .
and when we have overwhelming problems in front of us , we tend to seek simple answers .
you may just be loud or obnoxious , or some other way causing them to have the headache .
this is about 50 million light years away , so one of our neighboring galaxies .
she &apos;s interacting with her kids and her grand kids .
anyone can lead . anyone can follow .
and with biomimicry , if you &apos;ve got an underutilized resource , you don &apos;t think , &quot; &quot; how am i going to dispose of this ? &quot; &quot; you think , &quot; &quot; what can i add to the system to create more value ? &quot; &quot; and it turns out that different things crystallize out at different stages .
in the world of 4shbab , it &apos;s not about bump and grind .
their face doesn &apos;t look like this . when they &apos;re angry , they look ugly , every being , but when they &apos;re happy they look beautiful .
what would happen if you could actually pay twice as much money to cross the bridge , but go through a lane that &apos;s an express lane ?
so newcastle gave me a call . i said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ll do it from delhi . &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; there &apos;s no way you &apos;re going to handle a million pounds-worth of university money sitting in delhi . &quot; &quot; so in 2006 , i bought myself a heavy overcoat and moved to newcastle .
yes , that &apos;s us , with the greatest income inequality and the greatest social problems , according to those metrics .
i was the kind of religious where everyone i know donated 10 percent of everything they earned to the church , including myself .
that takes an enormous amount of faith and dedication .
because we have all those old men that are creating wars in africa . they will die soon .
i know you &apos;ve been given a lot of challenges today , but if you can take this one piece and think about it a little differently , because diversity is magic .
we &apos;re facing this problem .
but for the first time in three decades into this epidemic we have a real chance to come to grips with hiv .
all this stuff that happens around .
there &apos;s important insights just locked away in company data .
now , when we talk about suicide , there is also a medical contribution here , because 90 percent of suicides are related to a mental illness : depression , bipolar disorder , schizophrenia , anorexia , borderline personality . there &apos;s a long list of disorders that contribute , and as i mentioned before , often early in life .
there &apos;s a definition of leadership which says , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s the ability to use the smallest possible crisis for the biggest possible effect . &quot; &quot; and i want to talk about how we ensure that this crisis , which is by no means small , really is used to the full .
now , imagine building that up to a city , or to a society , and you &apos;ve got , obviously , an interesting problem .
in fact , this image also contains the equivalent of this , more specifically , this .
( music ) l.d. was my college romance .
the second thing i learned is that when people like me , who understood that fear , who had learned a new language , who had navigated new systems , when people like us were sitting at the table , we advocated for our communities &apos; needs in a way that no one else could or would .
it was mairead &apos;s sister .
when we saw that , we asked : could the impairment in visual integration be the manifestation of something underneath , of dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism ?
so if you lose that precious resource , where you are somewhat equal to the richer countries , that &apos;s a huge waste .
and the last thing is that — actually , the direction of the conversation .
here for example is a flamenco dancer , except there was one problem .
it will be prohibited because we &apos;ll have to save our natural resources in a few decades from now .
and it was a shocker , because it was everything we wanted those other pictures taken from orbit to be .
and tonight , what i would like to do is speak directly to other plutocrats , to my people , because it feels like it &apos;s time for us all to have a chat .
( applause )
the banks — these banks are now consolidated , and that strengthening of the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside .
i mean , that &apos;s what &apos;s harvest — we say we harvest the pig , you know ?
and so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world , unless you &apos;re a particle physicist .
but again , you can see this , kind of , organic fusion of multiple building elements to make a thing which is whole , but breaks down into smaller parts , but in an incredibly organic way .
why , we found , people were interested in this , is that at work they don &apos;t feel very expressed .
we need sustainable harmony . i love this term .
some things are certain , i think .
my mom &apos;s great-uncle was a jesuit priest .
one of the earlier results that we got — we have a singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a village of 25 vietnamese girls for their education , and that was one of the earliest results . and as i said , now there have been many , many stories that have come in , because we do have hundreds of charities in there , and the google foundation will be an even broader endeavor .
they look somewhat similar , but they mean very different things .
maybe we don &apos;t quite need the data , but we need reminders .
she says , &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t know , my mom always did it ! &quot; &quot; so they call grandma , and grandma says , &quot; &quot; my pan was too small ! &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so , it &apos;s not that we have good words and bad words .
by mid-century we &apos;ll be about 80 percent urban , and that &apos;s mostly in the developing world , where that &apos;s happening .
thank you .
here &apos;s a little caricature of a million individuals .
but compassion , from my vantage point , has a problem .
plank number one : adapt all the time .
just wanted to say , &quot; &quot; hey guys .
and two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people experience at that moment and the amount of skill that they feel they have at that moment .
he also runs this amazing drone mapping program , some of the images of which you can see behind me here and here .
do you know that today , there are over 70 million americans today who are underbanked , because existing banking services are not designed to address their basic needs .
women , celebrate your body , for god &apos;s sake .
it requires hundreds of steps , and it takes a long , long time .
but the money ran out .
so digging deeper into this with the science and technology council of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences reveals some truth behind the trickery .
and then we can debate , you know , is it better to be there , where performance is strong at the price of large disparities ?
they all have their breakfast and complain about everyone right there . and it &apos;s a great experience , and i really encourage you to drop in at that diner during that time , because that &apos;s quite essential american experience .
it was the most inspiring and empowering moment of my life .
many blind people use them to read pages on the web to themselves .
and you can see just what a shoestring operation this really was , because we cast these 16 blue leds in epoxy and you can see in the epoxy mold that we used , the word ziploc is still visible .
because in some way one could say sex isn &apos;t something you do , eh ?
that meant that in 1998 , the oldest among the group were only 14 , and the youngest , just four .
you need efforts to supplement schools .
they make balloon animals .
but the doctors of the day thought he was crazy , because they knew , and had for hundreds of years , that odorous vapors called miasmas caused disease , not these hypothetical particles that you couldn &apos;t see .
we haven &apos;t even started to try to solve the problems .
taniyama tried and tried and tried and he could never prove that it was true .
they came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread called carta musica made out of durum wheat , a type of cheese made from grass-fed animals so the cheese is high in omega-3 fatty acids instead of omega-6 fatty acids from corn-fed animals , and a type of wine that has three times the level of polyphenols than any known wine in the world .
the oceanographers , when they go and look at these hydrothermal vents , they &apos;re teeming with life , regardless of whether the water is acidic or alkaline — doesn &apos;t matter .
these thoughts were going through my head when i looked at the pages of my first dinosaur book .
and we looked at that and we said , we have to start much earlier .
i &apos;ll connect you , or say &quot; &quot; details , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; go back . &quot; &quot; dp : he &apos;s connecting me ! he doesn &apos;t even tell me the phone number .
you &apos;re immersed in the liquid .
the only thing anyone was trying to find out is what percentage of zambian children are vaccinated , and this is the data , collected on paper over weeks , from a single district , which is something like a county in the united states .
but that &apos;s only half of the story — 99.9 percent of the folding ratios produce not this , but this , the geometric equivalent of noise .
the attacks happened everywhere : in the hardware store , in my office , or even while reading a book in bed .
all stories interest me , and some haunt me until i end up writing them .
they even took the word &quot; &quot; citizen &quot; &quot; away from us , and imprisoned them for a whole year .
and i really think that &apos;s where we are .
thank you .
the visibility &apos;s 600 ft . ; we &apos;re on our safety lines ; the ice is moving all over the place .
our drinking water safe we make .
because it was when that happened with this walk-and-talk idea that things became doable and sustainable and viable .
and we believe that as designers , it holds us accountable to our customers .
very different notion .
these are my valentines from 2005 and 2006 .
and today , if you go to kurdistan , you &apos;ll see that kurdish peshmerga guerillas are squaring off against the sunni iraqi army .
in other words , the victim of an affair is not always the victim of the marriage .
i hope you are too .
and everyone agrees : politicians and scientists are in agreement that we are headed for a phosphorus crisis .
that &apos;s not being politically active , that &apos;s being bureaucratically active .
what about the problem of picking up a chess piece , dexterously manipulating it and putting it back down on the board ?
when i was a diplomat negotiating the disarmament treaties with the soviet union in geneva in the 1970s , we succeeded because we understood we shared a destiny with them .

there &apos;s something big and loud over here .
this fish actually has high beams .
everything is based on the files leaked by mr. snowden .
moral arguments within cultures are especially about issues of in-group , authority , purity .
mexico is not at all on par with the united states , but they are quite close .

similarly , the astronomer royal , whom we heard speak yesterday , also has a 50 percent probability estimate .
pm : so tell me , what do you look for in a friend ?
and it &apos;s the responsibility of the artist to ask questions about what that technology means and how it reflects our culture .
they feel fear and doubt . they procrastinate .
this image , to me , is almost like from a shakespearean play , with a man , surrounded by various influences , desperate to hold on to something true within himself , in a context of great suffering that he has created himself .
weather patterns have changed .
we can revert the malignant phenotype .
so this then seems pretty obvious that everything we &apos;ve achieved , and everything we care about , depends crucially on some relatively minor changes that made the human mind .
it &apos;s not a video game peripheral .

the smell of the garbage unloaded from those trucks was intense , and the noise of the traffic was loud and overbearing .
so i appreciate being here . thank you .
but basically by the time you &apos;re nine months and you &apos;re given birth , you have almost 60,000 miles of vessels inside your body .
so i came back to newcastle with these results and decided that there was something happening here that definitely was getting very serious .
and when i came out of my coma , i recognized my family , but i didn &apos;t remember my own past .
so again , you can see the extension of this great wall of galaxies showing up here .
( laughter ) so , you might say , ok , there are these differences between liberals and conservatives , but what makes those three other foundations moral ?
the top one , in fact , is walmart on the right .
maybe i can do this all the time .
you can make money , you can lose money in africa .
the meaning of her name is pig .
so we basically copied the format of the comic book to actually tell the stories of behind the scenes , how our projects actually evolve through adaptation and improvisation .
compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cross this tipping point .
it &apos;s really changed our lives in ways that are sort of imperceptible ; and yet , when you pull back , you see it all the time .
and if i tried , i &apos;d disappoint them .
and he studied — there was a film about king fishers .
black field , brown field , toxic waste field , battlefield — we &apos;re proving in the bronx that you can grow anywhere , on cement .
but at some point , he must have given up all hope .
so in 2000 , when it was announced that the citizenship application fee was going to more than double from 95 dollars to 225 dollars , i decided it was time to apply before i could no longer afford it .
so i remained with them , and the more i wrote that story , the more i got into those beliefs , and i think that &apos;s important for me — to take on the beliefs , because that is where the story is real , and that is where i &apos;m gonna find the answers to how i feel about certain questions that i have in life .
the thing about cancer — when i got into this , i really knew nothing about it , but working with david agus , i started watching how cancer was actually being treated and went to operations where it was being cut out .
a teacher once instructed me in the hallway : &quot; aaaaaas-king . &quot;
in a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute , only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have .
that &apos;s another piece .
( laughter ) yeah , i &apos;m not worried about it now .
so it &apos;s a really slow process , it &apos;s really expensive , and the outcome of that process , namely electronic circuit boards , are limited in all sorts of kind of interesting ways .
secondly , when we talk about men who are succeeding , we rightly consider them icons or pioneers or innovators to be emulated .
they &apos;re being generated at a pace that &apos;s far beyond what any human , or teams of humans , could hope to view , and you and i are contributing to that at this ted .
and this is really heavily backlit .
i see evidence everywhere of how it works .
and if your brain is failing at integrating bad news about the future , you will constantly leave your rose-tinted spectacles on .
when schools stop doing that all the time , i will admit that , yes , it &apos;s obvious that trial and error is a good thing .
some of you may wince to remember this riddle .
quantum mechanics was developed in the 1920s .
but excessive reliance on incentives demoralizes professional activity in two senses of that word .

i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m sorry , art center — art center is good , too .
an account that explains the presence of beauty in everything on this list is not going to be easy .
we should not shrink from this opportunity simply because we don &apos;t really understand it .
one of my students , who has now become an instructor , when he lost his vision , after a few months he was sitting in his three story house and he realized that he could hear everything going on throughout the house : conversations , people in the kitchen , people in the bathroom , several floors away , several walls away .
now , it was the courage and verve of radical designers like bucky and moholy that drew me to design .
think about that for a minute .
not stamps , but one day .
cheryl responded , &quot; &quot; well , first , i don &apos;t know what quinoa is . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) &quot; &quot; but i do know that it &apos;s a monday , and that in my school , at high school in the community , i always cook pasta . &quot; &quot; see , cheryl explained that for many of her kids , there were no meals on the weekends .
we can even add microprocessors and have this as an input and create squishy sound music that we &apos;ve done .
so far , a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music , but singers , like frank sinatra , could use the mic and do things that they could never do without a microphone .
so you ask about a defining moment — ain &apos;t no defining moment in american history for me .
that &apos;s a juvenile .
created after the post-election riots in kenya in 2008 , this crisis-mapping website and community is actually able to crowdsource and target the delivery of better rescue services to people trapped under the rubble , whether it &apos;s after the earthquakes in haiti , or more recently in italy .
about four months ago , we finally tied all this together and produced one of the first computer vision models that is capable of generating a human-like sentence when it sees a picture for the first time .

the next — second — equation says that there is no magnetism other than that .
( bono : yes ! ) andrew mwenda : i can see bono says he knows the country .
new models for pedagogy for the displaced .
and i ran the story and i said , &quot; &quot; what do you think ? &quot; &quot; and in the back of the room , a woman stood up and she said , &quot; &quot; in 35 years of living in this god forsaken place , you &apos;re the only person that &apos;s come down here and treated us with dignity .
she left , did the same thing — it was a 10-second conversation , such a short interaction .
and so i sat down to wait .
clearly , human locomotion is more complex than cat and salamander locomotion , but at the same time , the nervous system of humans is very similar to that of other vertebrates .
i was flying back to the u.s. from an exhibition overseas .
some use and advocate violence .
i take a picture of them everyday because i never know if i will make it back to them .
firstly , because greenhouse gases , once released , stay in the atmosphere for decades .
you &apos;d just have information come to you as you needed it .
think of the allosphere as a large , dynamically varying digital microscope that &apos;s connected to a supercomputer .
and he gets right over the trap , and i see that he &apos;s seen it .
i was in the gulf , and i was swimming around and saw a little octopus on the bottom .
and so , of course , i decided to create an art installation called the dna vending machine .
energy is the key factor here . it changed everything .
it has truly revolutionized the way we communicate on the planet .
and somehow , these most essential workers are also among the world &apos;s most underpaid and exploited today .
i started in 1999 to try and address this problem with an experiment , which was a very simple experiment in new delhi .
i can &apos;t tell you how reassured i was by the very last sentence in that glorious presentation by dean kamen a few days ago .
i enjoyed being pregnant . i loved it .
but i wanted the score of a game to be the byproduct of these other things , and not the end itself .
you could take these special unpaid leave , as they called them , and yet remain part of the diplomatic service , but not actually do any work .
this is a whole wall of bananas at different ripenesses on the opening day in this gallery in new york .
which means that each and every one of you here today knows at least one child that is suffering from a developmental disorder .
( laughter ) but what makes our experiences perhaps a little bit different and a little more unique than that of the average person is that we have this gnawing thing in the back of our mind that even in our darkest moments , and those times of despair , we think , &quot; &quot; hey , there might be an image to be made here , there might be a story to be told . &quot; &quot; and why is storytelling important ?
but there &apos;s also a certain beauty within this technology .
people who happened to be women didn &apos;t have the same rights , couldn &apos;t vote .
visible light has a wavelength , a size , that &apos;s much smaller than the things around you , the features on people &apos;s faces , the size of your cell phone .
it turns out , when you add mobility — the ability to roll around the table — you get a little more of a boost .
so if you take , say , natural gas , which is the most prevalent hydrocarbon source fuel , if you burn that in a modern general electric natural gas turbine , you &apos;ll get about 60 percent efficiency .
and this problem is : where are the plants ?
it evolves .
it &apos;s a very holistic way of improving the lives of the people living in the villages around the park .
some of it even came from lianas , those things that dangle in the middle of the jungle .
and then it &apos;s a high savings rate .
no , i &apos;m not even going to look up . no . &quot; &quot; to understand why this is happening to us , and what we can do about it , we need to learn more about moral psychology .
but not all the vessels have those to date .
and they decided to tell me that i could see .
tm : ok , now for all the talking , and inspiring , and possibility-modeling we &apos;ve done , we &apos;ve been nowhere near perfect .
fatah , hamas and the popular front !
what happens right now , though , is that we have this mixing airflow pattern .
and i wanted to see — i want to dedicate this film to my father , homer .
haryana is a state which has 30 million people .
the idea is that , with free electricity , they will no longer have to use firewood to cook their food .
so , i was going to throw some condoms in the room and whatnot , but i &apos;m not sure it &apos;s the etiquette here .
well i don &apos;t have time to tell you about all the mathematics , but underlying this is the social networks , because this is a universal phenomenon .
and we &apos;ve never looked back .
it started out in the &apos; 80s , but at the beginning it was machines carving out of a foam block a model that was very , very fragile , and could not have any real use .
this was a brain that paid its dues .
in spite of what some people in the press don &apos;t get it , didn &apos;t understand it , we didn &apos;t take it off because we didn &apos;t want to do — having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want .
they do this with their toes . it &apos;s bizarre ! this peeling inspired irobot — that we work with — to build mecho-geckos .
we have this war with iran coming for 10 years now , and we have people , you know , afraid .
bringing up three children when you &apos;re the world &apos;s richest family seems like a social experiment without much prior art .
( singing ) ( laughter ) and i took a high-speed video of my throat while i was humming .
all right , so you get your little tutorial right there .
and it &apos;s expanding .
i was a misfit .
within 12 hours , i was horribly sunburned , just like richard dreyfuss in the movie .
the stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter .
all right , let me show you some more about this .
this is clara , a famous rhinoceros that was traveling europe in the mid-1700s , at a time when seeing a rhino was an exciting rarity .
i am a leader , so i know i cannot do anything alone .
but we know that occasionally ants go astray , and what happens is that , if army ants are wandering around and they get lost , they start to follow a simple rule — just do what the ant in front of you does .
salmon is a carnivore , it has no way to digest soy .
this is where we want to get , though , in the next three years .
all right , i can see a rhinovirus — and here &apos;s the blow-up of the rhinovirus &apos;s little barcode — but what about different rhinoviruses ?
they were delighted , and by the time it was time to go see the principal , whom they &apos;d actually come to see — not the computer room — they went upstairs and they said , &quot; &quot; this is absolutely remarkable !
of course , there are the bases , which refer to specific sexual activities that happen in a very specific order , ultimately resulting in scoring a run or hitting a home run , which is usually having vaginal intercourse to the point of orgasm , at least for the guy .
so as a great physicist once said , there &apos;s these little upstream eddies of biology that create order in this rapid torrent of entropy .
people look at the roads , for example , and they &apos;d say , &quot; angola : 90 percent of roads are untarred . ah , problem ! &quot;
this is sea-monkeys .
uncontacted peoples hold a mystical and iconic role in our imagination .
let &apos;s journey together . let &apos;s journey together .
the way we do that , i believe , is at the level of the city .
we &apos;re the ones who have to do it .
so you just get a bigger and bigger ball of whatever that is mixed with your tears on your eye until eventually , the ball becomes so big that the surface tension takes it across the bridge of your nose like a tiny little waterfall and goes &quot; &quot; goosh &quot; &quot; into your other eye , and now i was completely blind outside the spaceship .
so next time you &apos;re talking to a stranger and you feel comfortable , tell them something true about yourself , something really personal .
other places , gmo is saving the world .
but think again . why should that be always the case ?
but then along came the industrial revolution , and then goods became the predominant economic offering , where we used commodities as a raw material to be able to make or manufacture goods .
and it &apos;s viewed in those sort of idealistic terms .
i work with really amazing , little , itty-bitty creatures called cells .
( laughter ) and when the crisis was happening , the head of quantitative equities at lehman brothers said , &quot; &quot; events which models predicted would happen once every 10,000 years happened every day for three days . &quot; &quot; so , it &apos;s extraordinary . it &apos;s a new world that &apos;s very , very difficult to make sense of .
now what i like about this video is it &apos;s actually a video of the first time they ever danced together because of his lead . he had a strong lead .
i graduated .
and at the same time , you have a number that you can call to get more information on commuting , or a low-interest loan on a different kind of car , or whatever it is you &apos;re going to need to actually reduce your gasoline dependence .
so now we faced , you know , a little bit of a problem here .
tattoo was , at one time , a kind of a blacklisted or con thing , but now it is in thing .
so if you put these physiological processes to work , i &apos;d hypothesize that it might be our increased intake of refined grains , sugars and starches that &apos;s driving this epidemic of obesity and diabetes , but through insulin resistance , you see , and not necessarily through just overeating and under-exercising .
so i immediately decided , this is going to be the name of the game , or my new exclamation .
so this morning i &apos;m going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand .
i &apos;m just the same as everybody else . &quot; &quot; and i think that &apos;s actually a really telling answer , because it suggests that the circles of these altruists don &apos;t look like this , they look more like this .
it &apos;s almost as though most of gravity has gone missing .
he makes us the subject of his art .
so , it &apos;s about choosing the parts of the bible about compassion , about tolerance , about loving your neighbor , as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin , or intolerance , or violence , which are very much in the bible as well .
plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cooling load by a third .
or if they do have our interests at heart , we worry that they don &apos;t know us well enough to figure out what they need to do in order to allow us to secure those interests .
( applause ) thank you . thank you very much . thank you . thank you very much .
i had a lot of journalists calling me , asking me , &quot; &quot; which is the test they &apos;re going to run that will tell us whether or not caster semenya is male or female ? &quot; &quot; and i had to explain to the journalists there isn &apos;t such a test .
look into those eyes . i &apos;m not able to focus those eyes .
and there are a lot of other problems with that . it &apos;s very hard to do .
but you will remain one of the most important superpowers , and the most hopeful superpower , for the time to be .
in a primitive and simple world , there &apos;s really no reason for a model because feeling is close to reality .
i could get you admitted right away , and the whole thing could be very discrete . &apos; &apos; ha , ha , ha .
you cannot say it &apos;s a mere treatment 10,000 dollars , but because you are poor i &apos;ll give it for 9,000 .
redemption songs .
the physicians of the ancient world — especially the egyptians , who started medicine as we know it — were very conscious of what they could and couldn &apos;t treat .
and if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks , it &apos;s worth 100 bucks no matter what you &apos;re saving it on . people don &apos;t think that way .
they tend to be creative . they tend to be entrepreneurial .
we &apos;re not interested in your help . &quot; &quot; and he threw me out of the room .
what i find amazing is that africa is transcending its geography problem .
and it turns out that as we called around to the independent crash test companies around the country , none of them wanted to do our crash test because they said , some explicitly , some not so explicitly , &quot; &quot; all of our business comes from car seat manufacturers .
now , similarly , in locke ’ s society there are individuals who have certain rights , properties in a formal sense , and those are defined with respect to some absolute , abstract notions of rights and justice , and so forth , which are independent of what else has happened in the society .
these are survival skills .
and indeed , i think , rather than being annihilated , the performing arts are poised on the brink of a time when we will be more important than we have ever been .
now , we &apos;re all here to dream , but maybe if we &apos;re honest about it , each of us chasing our own dream .
this is due to the attraction and the repulsion of the individual particles inside the liquid .
we &apos;re going to speak now to the operations center .
then we made these legs that are cast in soil with a potato root system growing in them , and beetroots out the top , and a very lovely brass toe .
but i &apos;m obsessive , so i couldn &apos;t just stop there , so i actually started modifying the bunks where you could actually slide out the bunks and slide in desks or shelving , so the same unit can now be used for an office or storage location .
well , ultimately , it could mean that you could print your own medicine .
it was , what i would say , compositional complexity , and i felt that if i had to fulfill what i talked about — a building for science — there had to be some kind of a generating idea , some kind of a generating geometry .
they said , we won &apos;t think about it until we know it &apos;s right .
rb : philippe is quite erratic , so i think that he wouldn &apos;t be the best person to design the engine , no .
so we were the first to actually name a bird from the famous series that later exploded onto the pages of science and nature .
well before i go any further , this is something worth sharing .
and there was something very moving about all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky .
well , i finally decided i needed to lose weight , and i knew i could because i &apos;d done it so many times before , so i simply stopped eating as much .
and if you &apos;re in the half-mile radius of where this bomb went off , you have a 90 percent chance of not making it .
and when i started out , i was just using these blue duct-tape filters over my strobe , so i could make sure i &apos;m actually seeing the light that &apos;s being transformed by the animals .
we need more than that . where do we draw the line ?
some of us have a burglar alarm system at home , and some of us don &apos;t .
he saw that first glint of light — he knew what the weather was going to be three days from now .
we might even call them citizens , because they &apos;ve recently risen up to fight against legislative incursion , and the citizens of these networks work together to serve each other in great ways .
a plant , quite simply , needs light , it needs co2 , but even more importantly , it needs nutrients , which it draws from the soil .
i remember one day , it was a very hot day in the spring , and we hadn &apos;t been in a fight in a couple of weeks , maybe .
obviously that doesn &apos;t work very well for — ca : what just happened there ? we just saw something land ?
they hatched out in india .
so what we need is space inside the aircraft , inside a very dense area .
now , would that this were just about sarah palin and her reality tv show .
and i learned a new word last week .
and hence , the enormous role that a marine protected area can play .
he &apos;s standing the watch in helmand , in southern afghanistan .
many had undiagnosed conditions like multiple sclerosis , epilepsy , brain tumors .
i can &apos;t forget auntie .
you get divided , and a continent &apos;s division corresponds to a fork in the evolutionary tree , or you &apos;re crafty , and you manage to escape from one to the other and erase that division , or you &apos;re living peacefully on each side , and on one side you just go extinct , and you survive on the other side and create a difference .
make a decision and give me some blood .
i don &apos;t want him killed . i know he &apos;s going to love cliffs .
and her voice was the most powerful voice .
yeah . jack — you &#91; unclear &#93; with jack ? jack
but as i sat there for four hours , the full afternoon , reading maslow , i recognized something that is true of most leaders .
because , you know , most people , when they hear that i predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more , they think that i &apos;m saying that we &apos;re going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more .
you know about objects and their properties .
where do you see your doctor and your dentist ? &quot; &quot; then i &apos;m very much of the united states , and i have been for 48 years now , since i was a really small child .
but a lot of times , whole categories of innovation — ones that can help us live more beautifully — turn out to be illegal .
they wouldn &apos;t go listen to him .
no democracy anywhere in the world offers this feature to its citizens for either legislation or for budgets , even though those are the things done with our consent and with our money .
and he was soon controlling huge servers around the world where he stored his games that he had cracked and pirated .
howard is not so easily placated .
ag : so we know that young people are the present and the future , but what inspires me are older people who are becoming transformed in the service of this movement .
now , in a situation where the best current treatment is inexpensive and simple to deliver , the answer is straightforward .
around the world , my shows air in 256 territories in 67 languages for an audience of 30 million people .
but even after months of working feverishly — sleeping in our offices and not going home , candy bars for dinner , coffee by the bucketful — physicists are machines for turning coffee into diagrams — ( laughter ) this little bump would not go away .
so the first time i worked with colors was by making these mosaics of pantone swatches .
when i went to sleep , the next day it wasn &apos;t there .
if you want to add to this picture and try and sketch it globally , you really have to force yourself to go down to the four corners of the earth — africa , india , antarctica , australia — and start putting together some of these pieces .
so john &apos;s now 18 months further down in that journey , and i &apos;ve now asked him to tell us something about his current predicament .
so i &apos;m looking , really , for a mentor , because i just had my birthday .
and it is a true challenge , and i do want you to help me .

edison stated it best . he said , &quot; &quot; hell , we ain &apos;t got no rules around here , we &apos;re trying to accomplish something . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so , how do you restore trust ?
because it took negotiation for almost every one of these photographs — to get into that place to make those photographs , and if it wasn &apos;t for those people letting me in at the heads of those corporations , i would have never made this body of work .
why couldn &apos;t masa have taken an airplane to sweden ?
we &apos;d actually — ( laughter ) it would be harder . it would take — take 2 would be a bitch .
( applause )
i believe we can connect every school in ethiopia , every health clinic , every hospital — we can connect to the internet .
you should be nice to nerds .
getting to school , for a kid that was actually pretty short for his age , through the canadian winter , was not a pleasant experience .
mt : sorry . now , one way of persuading humans that robots are safe is to create the illusion of trust .
the flashlight gives us this really intense , bright l.e.d. , and six hours worth of rechargeable battery pack , and the lunch box is a nice little package in which you can put everything inside , and a bunch of mini speakers to sort of amplify the sound large enough .
this bias and systematic lack of engagement of indigenous people in both clinical trials and genome studies is partially the result of a history of distrust .
so , sometimes , wolfram alpha will be able to do the whole thing immediately and just give back a whole big program that you can then compute with .
thanks .
i used to be a fan of bach .
they are a kind of social capital .
( laughter ) and so , to me , i wanted more value in this , so when she asked if she could play a game , i said , &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and so i happened to have all of these little pieces .
you see the canal they dug ?
i went to teach seventh graders math in the new york city public schools .
and that is , to me , the sign of a masterpiece , of a painting when there &apos;s a lack of resolution .
so we won &apos;t give the rest of the code , but we will give the three quotations .
and the question is , should we run them or not ?
you can &apos;t be a feminist who &apos;s also interested in fashion .
the future research is &quot; &quot; how can we find the genetic and molecular markers for the viability of seeds , without having to plant them every 10 years ? &quot; &quot; and we &apos;re almost there .
so unfortunately , this orphan spends most of his time in storage , along with quite a number of other orphans , some of them some beautiful paintings .
this was a golden age of bipartisanship , at least in terms of the parties &apos; ability to work together and solve grand national problems .
well , eventually i learned enough english , and my parents were so happy the day that i got into medical school and took my oath of healing and service .
we then use optical sorting to color sort this material .
and i will be in your corner for the rest of your life . &quot; &quot; for me , that is the power of girls .
finally , this is a 26-year-old nun i spoke to .
it &apos;s our own pond . and that &apos;s how it happens . &quot; &quot; and she goes , &quot; &quot; then how do they get fertilized ? &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; well , men , through their penis , they fertilize the eggs by the sperm coming out .
toxic waste , i guess , is the key clue to that one .
it craves stories of success in dealing with complex issues , especially in developing countries .
the ashaninka people are known throughout south america for their dignity , their spirit and their resistance , starting with the incas and continuing through the 19th century with the rubber tappers .
and then there is social media , and what &apos;s happening on the internet .
and it feels just incredibly cool to do that .

there are hundreds of them all over the earth , but in this country , james van praagh is very big .
we &apos;ve got to confront that reality .
they accompany me wherever i go in my life , and i fill them with all sorts of things , records of my lived experience : so watercolor paintings , drawings of what i see , dead flowers , dead insects , pasted ticket stubs , rusting coins , business cards , writings .
so i should say , i guess , that since the time of that original president johnson report , and the various reports of the u.s. national academy — 1977 , 1982 , 1990 — people always talked about this idea .
that hit a wall . they couldn &apos;t shrink them and keep the vacuum .
among the most pressing challenges that our species is faced with today are the chronic problems of africa .
the hospital put him on a water drip for three days .
it took me several months to design the column , but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces .
there &apos;s lots of room , so people can come up and understand what it is before they get involved .
so i want to tell you about someone like this that i know .
think of this as a form of edited biology .
we &apos;ll go over to jacques tati here and grab our blue friend and put him down on the table as well .
there she is .
maybe not surprisingly , in the deep ocean , where it &apos;s mostly blue , the photoreceptors tend to see blue light .
whether it &apos;s a &quot; &quot; floral fusion &quot; &quot; or a &quot; &quot; paradise winds , &quot; &quot; they &apos;ll have their chance .
when was the last time you were at ted and you got to connect physically with every single person in the room ?
so anyway , she comes here , 1967 , she &apos;s pregnant , and she comes from ethiopia that was celebrating its own jubilee at the time under the emperor haile selassie , and she lands months before the enoch powell speech , the &quot; &quot; rivers of blood &quot; &quot; speech .
so , everything that i put into my body , i considered as medicine .
it &apos;s such a big problem , so complex . can we really do it ?
so , what if you could get your gas at a 10th the price ?
she also creates life-size fiberglass sculptures , often of animals , which she then completely covers in bindis , often with potent symbolism .
and you can &apos;t just draw them arbitrarily .
first we &apos;ll see the animals toes peeling — look at that .
and if you don &apos;t know where to find someone different , go to the places you wouldn &apos;t usually go .
and what looks like two big heaps of leaves , is actually two single leaves that get shredded up by the harsh desert conditions over time .
and we &apos;re acting out of that fear .
if you are trying to solve a really hard problem , you can speak up and be color brave .
this is hitting the reservoirs .
on twitter that night , we were like toddlers crawling towards a gun .
well real organized crime on the internet goes back about 10 years when a group of gifted ukrainian hackers developed a website , which led to the industrialization of cybercrime .
and after noah built his ark , i believe he told noah to warn the people that they must change all their wicked ways before he come upon them and destroy them .
because here &apos;s the crazy thing : in law enforcement , we have evolved into something incredible .
these were networks of mercenaries , not ideologues , who were in the coordination business for profit .
and when you &apos;re hungry , food becomes more attractive , and so forth .
it &apos;s their right to fight . &quot; &quot; now as you know , mandela didn &apos;t do that .
going back to the beginning of our country — historically , defenses meant protection of the homeland .
i collect autographed books , and those of you authors in the audience know i hound you for them — and cds too , tracy .
so we had jonathan train with the vest for four days , two hours a day , and here he is on the fifth day .
they can be shocking or silly or soulful .
this is the mechanism by which you lower blood pressure , by which you dilate the coronary arteries also , to let the blood be supplied with the heart .
i sit on the board of a center for the developmentally disabled , and these people want laughter and compassion and they want love .
now to bring home the point of how close it is — the relationship between the grid of neurons and the topographical arrangement of the activity of the neurons and our mental experience — i &apos;m going to tell you a personal story .
does your work relate to his ?
we &apos;ve actually kind of made an ethical choice in society to not have coral reefs .
so here are some of the technical terms , all three-letter things , that you &apos;ll see a lot more of .
and even animals , like these donkeys , love our buildings .
so where are we ?
this work , which was published in &quot; &quot; nature , &quot; &quot; late 2009 , after a number of years of analysis , led to the final proposition that we can only find nine planetary boundaries with which , under active stewardship , would allow ourselves to have a safe operating space .
ak : wow , a hundred million miles away . this is crazy !
we just dismiss it out of our consciousness .
here &apos;s the first easy problem : you can have 60 dollars now or 50 dollars now . which would you prefer ?
so imagine , if you as a high school can have the satellite for a week and do satellite space experiments like that .
those were the achievements of our great regime .
you see , we tend to think the problem is solved when we solve the technology problem .
so why is that happening ?
so listening to this brought something to the ear besides the obvious burst .
one is in india , where there are 240 million farmers , most of whom make less than two dollars a day .
and this routine went on for some time .
in order not to steal it from our children , we have to do two things .
and they just wiped out — these pathogens just wiped out the native people , who had no immunity to them at all .
i have here a model of the sky that corresponds to the real sky . okay ?
they dropped it , they walked away , but they were arrested .
and the reason why i bring up radio is that i think radio is a great example of how a new medium defines new formats which then define new stories .
and if i can get the camera — okay , great — you &apos;ll see , as i get sort of close ...
in fact , i view the two forces as fusing together into what i call &quot; &quot; connectography . &quot; &quot; connectography represents a quantum leap in the mobility of people , resources and ideas , but it is an evolution , an evolution of the world from political geography , which is how we legally divide the world , to functional geography , which is how we actually use the world , from nations and borders , to infrastructure and supply chains .
another flash alerts you to an open receiver .
and if you &apos;re a leader , the people who count on you need you on your feet .
can you say &quot; &quot; raw &quot; &quot; ?
so , it has to end with this — ( laughter ) — gratuitous violence . ( laughter )
well , how do we boot up a chromosome ? how do we activate this ?
and so the first thought that came to mind is , everywhere we park we have electric power .
tell us briefly about that and your role in that .
it is very scary to go through that feeling of &quot; &quot; i am about to die &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; i could die in this explosion . &quot; &quot; but there &apos;s also the fear of losing loved ones , and i think that &apos;s even worse .
and this turns out to be useful .
second of all , the court doubled down on this exclusion by making it legally inconsequential .
let &apos;s talk about billions . let &apos;s talk about
being criminalized leaves you exposed to mistreatment by the state itself .
and you know , it &apos;s just one of the great things about being a musician , is that it is so unbelievably fluid .
it means &quot; &quot; i have enough . &quot; &quot; and that is utterly true .
the concept that they &apos;re working towards — and they have working prototypes — is that we placed it throughout the motor points of the body where they &apos;re needed .
so my freshman year of college i signed up for an internship in the housing unit at greater boston legal services .
it &apos;s not a lot of money at the global level .
tolerance is not really a lived virtue ; it &apos;s more of a cerebral ascent .
and as far as isolation goes , when we as a species do colonize distant planets , there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way .
( laughter ) sr : are you convinced ?
what if , in the coming crowd of nine billion ...
two men , rahul and rajiv , living in the same neighborhood , from the same educational background , similar occupation , and they both turn up at their local accident emergency complaining of acute chest pain .
so when the echo of the gunshots had lingered , it was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob , and i didn &apos;t believe what i was hearing .
now , here &apos;s the story .
the colors show the continent .
so in fact , the price of timber in the beijing marketplace ought to have been three-times what it was had it reflected the true pain and the costs to the society within china .
and yet you don &apos;t put a letter after that first &quot; &quot; t. &quot; &quot; why ? because it wouldn &apos;t have been useful in the past .
so one of the people that i met was a senior bush administration official , who had this to say about our unmanning of war : &quot; &quot; it plays to our strength . the thing that scares people is our technology . &quot; &quot; but when you go out and meet with people , for example in lebanon , it &apos;s a very different story . one of the people i met with there was a news editor , and we &apos;re talking as a drone is flying above him , and this is what he had to say .
it &apos;s brought a lot of bad stuff , like the stuff that i just described , but it &apos;s also brought a lot of good stuff .
right now , her favorite character is groot .
well , what happened when i was a little kid was — some pretty heavy stuff too .
this light switch that reads , on the one hand , flashfloods , and on the other hand , off .
this plus the fact that you &apos;ve got phenomenal work from ceos from ford to zappos , connecting on twitter , creating an open environment , allowing their employees to be part of the process , rather than hidden behind walls .
and the blue hoods helped us with two things : one , we could easily erase their heads ; and we also put tracking markers on their heads so we could recreate the camera motion and the lens optics from the set .
thank you for your kind attention .
it &apos;s really a time machine .
here &apos;s the gecko running up a vertical surface . there it goes , in real time . there it goes again . obviously , we have to slow this down a little bit .
so of course , labor isn &apos;t free , on that practical versus awesome spectrum .
and that &apos;s that the company and the building was multiform .
the other kind of reviewer is a certain flavor of feminist who thinks they know what little girls ought to be .
and then i started to think , ok , well now this thing is probably just laughing at me , because it hasn &apos;t left , and i probably just look like this impotent , powerless thing that couldn &apos;t get it to go away .
and the prophet , in one of his sayings , said , &quot; adorn yourselves with the attributes of god . &quot;
but over time , interestingly enough , this concept adopted the branching schema of a tree in what became known as the porphyrian tree , also considered to be the oldest tree of knowledge .
most people think that i was an actress . i was never an actress . &quot; &quot; but i hadn &apos;t asked that , and then she went off on a tear , and she said , &quot; &quot; oh , well , there was that one time that i was an actress .
and we &apos;re alive .
darwin also has a lot of other talents .
now , as a mother , what do i want the very most for my children ?
because everybody is downstream , downwind of whatever is done .
a storm blew in that no one was anticipating .
and this idea of machine learning is going everywhere .
you can see the united states and california and san diego , and you can use the mouse or the keyboard to spin things around .
and we have this kind of — as voters , we have kind of a &quot; &quot; eureka ! &quot; &quot; moment .
we then take this vascular structure and we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply .
with the millions of visitors that come every year , it &apos;s actually one of the best places to try to invent the museum of the future .
i &apos;m told they don &apos;t bite ; in fact , they might not even leave that jar .
if the state is more than just a market fixer , if it actually is a market shaper , and in doing that has had to take on this massive risk , what happened to the reward ?
we &apos;ve developed this ability because it makes evolutionary sense .
each of us , every day , need just eight glasses of this , because we &apos;re human .
and then i actually slow down my whole nervous system .
those are goat babies .
and when the vaccine appeared last winter , there were a lot of people — a surprising number — who refused to get it — as a nice example of how people &apos;s feelings of security change , how their model changes , sort of wildly with no new information , with no new input .
over 50 new countries were born .
and then i took an inventory of the characteristics , along with her , of the of the capabilities and elements of different dancers who &apos;d won championships .
another important idea is this notion of persistence of character across realities .
and this ceremony has to take place in front of the eyes of the whole community with everyone &apos;s participation .
but the cyclist , we see , is going to proceed through the intersection .
a local official literally prostrated himself in the street , in front of these protesters , in order to get them to go away .
these are rounded numbers .
and then pushing the glass in with its own friction .
we can choose life over fear .
so when you finally actually get outside on a spacewalk , it feels much different than it would if you just went out first time .
so , sarah and i — my wife — walked over to the public library , which is four blocks away , on pacific street , and we got the oed , and we looked in there , and there are 14 definitions of hope , none of which really hits you between the eyes as being the appropriate one .
you now , our brain is two to three percent of the body mass , but actually it uses 25 percent of the total energy we use .
if l &apos;oréal in india , in the philippines , in brazil and in russia can do it , you can , too .
and we &apos;re starting in june . so this is the monsoon rain .
i &apos;m a visual artist .
we will need a robust cybersecurity approach that protects sensitive information and intellectual property and safeguards critical infrastructure from cyberattacks .
no , we learned something else .
perhaps because a lesson had been learned by the weak response to the war in bosnia and the failure in rwanda , when serbia attacked kosovo , international action was taken much more decisively .
your politician &apos;s always echoing that trickle-down idea by saying things like , &quot; &quot; well , if you raise the price of employment , guess what happens ? you get less of it . &quot; &quot; are you sure ?
cmus aren &apos;t solitary confinement , but they radically restrict all of these to levels that meet or exceed the most extreme prisons in the united states .
and i started doing research , and we found , very excitingly , that the skin produces nitric oxide .
this was not something that happened with regularity back then in 1998 , and by this , i mean the stealing of people &apos;s private words , actions , conversations or photos , and then making them public — public without consent , public without context , and public without compassion .
you &apos;re just two people shouting out barely related sentences in the same place .
one of the fundamental characteristics of a network is that , once you are linked in the network , the network starts to shape your views and starts to shape your interactions with everybody else .
( applause ) because ladies and gentlemen , that &apos;s my day job .
and so , a lot of what has been done with people like danny hillis and others is to try to bring in engineering principles , try to bring the software .
and you know , we love grandma and we love uncle joe . we do .
this sounds great . a lot of people agree .
but because of writers like chinua achebe and camara laye , i went through a mental shift in my perception of literature .
there is no keyboard standard because there &apos;s no market .
what i discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces .
together , the central banks of the u.s. , u.k and japan increased the stock of money in their economies by 3.7 trillion dollars .
and it &apos;s a very horrible thing to see anarchy , to know that the police and the military — there were lots of military troops there — actually can &apos;t stop that rampaging mob who &apos;s coming down the street .
to mention just a few examples , our lives are longer , materially much richer , and less plagued by violence than are the lives of people in traditional societies .
as a patient , i need to do sit and stand movements , and when i stand up , i bid for the items i want to buy .
these are the ones where you have to press what floor you &apos;re going to go to before you get in the elevator .
and so if we can learn lessons from the innovators in every sector , then in the future we make together , that happiness can be just as ubiquitous as coca-cola .
and they &apos;re going to be playing this clip : &quot; i &apos;m such a good mother . &quot;
since then , no one has ever skied — this was 93 years ago — since then , no one has ever skied from the coast of antarctica to the pole and back .
and you can see , eventually the airport actually flips directions .
i do believe if we build a movement that &apos;s one million americans strong , we &apos;re not going to be denied .
there have been several close calls .
three months after that , i did my first runway show for alexander mcqueen on a pair of hand-carved wooden legs made from solid ash .
( laughter ) one of my most recent endeavors is to try to translate the habits of creativity that i &apos;ve learned into something others can replicate .
as china plays such an important role in the global economy and geopolitics , the decisions made based on the zodiac and other chinese traditions end up impacting everyone around the world .
we have all this at the same time .
the goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have ; the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe .
a marvelous place .
who will win ? canada ? russia ? the united states ?
but they are falling only slowly , because in botswana , with good economy and governance , they can manage to treat people .
it was just lying on the surface .
when you provide such a focus point , a swarm intelligence emerges .
and this graph sort of sums up what the problem is .
steaming ought to be faster .
and the starshade is a very specially shaped screen and the goal is to fly that starshade so it blocks out the light of a star so that the telescope can see the planets directly .
i &apos;m very , very , very inspired by movies .
we were driving with friends down a dark road at night , when a police car stopped us .
this species lives only in the congo .
( laughter ) so he sat me down , and he warned me .
so , if i simplify the laws of simplicity , i have what &apos;s called the cookie versus laundry thing .
and much of the political and social history of the last 200 years involved what to do with this class , and the new problems and opportunities .
and i &apos;m so glad to be here , and i &apos;m very grateful to be here , chris .
gross .
es : it &apos;s no mystery that there are governments out there that want to see me dead .
&quot; electricity . &quot;
and then jay chiat , a friend and client , asked me to do his headquarters building in l.a.
everyone was very excited about this archaeological find , because it meant that they might finally be able to assemble a single dodo skeleton .
as i &apos;m signing on to the various dating websites , as it happens , i was really , really busy .
and the world population in the meantime has doubled .
the young accused the old .
so while pgp does a great job of what it &apos;s designed to do , for the people out there who can &apos;t understand how to use it , the option to communicate privately simply does not exist .
and so , as we get to stage 12 and we partake of that , again completing the life cycle , you know , we have a chance to essentially ingest that — it nurtures us , and we continue to carry on and have opportunities to ponder things like this .
it &apos;s not clear why they thought she had the flu , but they switched to tamiflu .
but i did find myself wondering , what &apos;s happening now ?
and i thought to myself , well , that &apos;s well outside my lifetime , and a much greater figure than the predictions for oil .
in the congo , for those of you who don &apos;t know , there has been a war raging for the last 12 years , a war that has killed nearly six million people .
1939 , that &apos;s when they discovered oil .
i found neruda scribbled on a piece of paper in a field hospital in tahrir , and i decided to take a no of mamluk mausoleum in cairo .
i &apos;m going to share with you four of those commitments now .
it &apos;s about what we do right here , right now , and for the rest of our working lives .
so imagine white guys pasting white papers .
but e-miles follow moore &apos;s law .
in other words , what are the costs of doing business as usual ?
that &apos;s year by year . this comes from our friends at gapminder.com.
they have flown in the past , but without saving capabilities , without batteries .
( laughter ) okay , here &apos;s another question : do you think of yourself as spiritual in any way , shape or form ? raise your hand .
okay . right to left , how many ? okay .
buy it anyway .
yet actually , whenever we talk about human rights , we do say that human rights are universal .
we can flag that and we can put it to the side , and people who are buyers and consumers don &apos;t have to deal with it .
and this trend of what rachel naomi remen is doing , how these kinds of virtues are finding a place in the vocabulary of medicine — the work fred luskin is doing — i think this is one of the most fascinating developments of the 21st century — that science , in fact , is taking a virtue like compassion definitively out of the realm of idealism .
she scared us with the lava man is coming , then the tsunami is coming , but then finally there were flowers and trees , and it was very beautiful .
you know , we &apos;re pumping out lots of co2 into the atmosphere , from fossil fuels , from cement production .
well , i should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensors stopped working .
the weight is really difficult when it &apos;s up above your head .
but i persevered , and i eventually conducted some experiments deep in the forest , 25 years ago .
he couldn &apos;t free himself from personal problems and personal evils that included murder and adultery .
modeling : on the right hand side , there &apos;s a very complex computational model .
yellow is so-so , and in green are the countries doing really well .
because we are all dependent on these water sources .
i &apos;d gone up to photograph orcas , and we had looked for a week , and we hadn &apos;t seen a damn orca .
so here &apos;s the sound that we played in the room .
here is this diagram in crochetness .
today we have the opportunity , and we have the imperative , to create thousands of new ways of interconnecting between networks and institutions , thousands of new kinds of juries : the citizen jury , the carrotmob , the hackathon , we are just beginning to invent the models by which we can cocreate the process of governance .
this was taken in the old croton aqueduct , which supplied fresh water to new york city for the first time .
and here studying , in three dimensions , how to give some kind , again , of order , a structure ; not something you feel you could just change because you stop the design of that particular process .
your new joint venture partner might shake your hand , celebrate , go out to dinner with you and then leak an expression of anger .
and then something for me changed pretty profoundly .
and here &apos;s an interesting map .
so can you imagine the situation — she walks all this way to go get her injection .
so for instance , we told some people , &quot; &quot; look , you can buy the sweater , but you can &apos;t tell anybody you own it , and you can &apos;t resell it . &quot; &quot; that drops the value of it , suggesting that that &apos;s one reason why we like it .
bg : a personal question , and this is the last one .
the globalization of power — we talk about the globalization of markets , but actually it &apos;s the globalization of real power .
and that &apos;s why i believe that groups like ted , discussions like this around the planet , are the place where the future of foreign policy , of economic policy , of social policy , of philosophy , will ultimately take place .
here &apos;s one : &quot; &quot; gold gab ich für eisen , 1813 . &quot; &quot; the interesting thing is that for 50 years hence , the highest status jewelry you could wear in prussia wasn &apos;t made of gold or diamonds .
but it &apos;s not just the mortality from these disorders .
and one day he couldn &apos;t add up a line of figures .
by the way , i &apos;m teaching you how to use our website , gapminder world , while i &apos;m correcting this , because this is a free utility on the net .
you may have heard about rathergate , which was basically the result of bloggers realizing that the &quot; &quot; th &quot; &quot; in 111 is not typeset on an old typewriter ; it &apos;s on word .
but we want to make them have enough information that we can get the cells to do what we want , but not be so complex as to make it difficult to get to clinic .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not limited to the james camerons of the world , but something that we &apos;re all participating in .
but it &apos;s now your turn .
because we &apos;d been held up in russia , of course , the full moon brings the highest and lowest tides ; when you &apos;re standing on the frozen surface of the sea , high and low tides generally mean that interesting things are going to happen — the ice is going to start moving around a bit .
and then as we go further , today we have continuous glucose sensors .
your mission is to figure out how you want to spend your extra seven and a half minutes .
and actually , since this is a tech crowd , i talk in the book about how the bible actually reminds me of the wikipedia , because it has all of these authors and editors over hundreds of years .
the first experiment — i walked around mit and i distributed six-packs of cokes in the refrigerators — these were common refrigerators for the undergrads .
( laughter ) on a 42,000 mile mountain range . great job security , but not the way to go .
this is auto-gyro jousting in malibu in the 30s .
but there &apos;s one big puzzle remaining , and this was most succinctly put to me by my primary school math teacher in tanzania , who &apos;s a wonderful scottish lady who i still stay in touch with .
but you go back to the same vent eight years later and it can be completely dead .
the camera is actually doing — just , getting all the images — is doing the edge recognition and also the color recognition and so many other small algorithms are going on inside .
you can also code to interact with the physical world around you .
so hyperscore lets you start from scratch very quickly .
but what &apos;s even more striking is what &apos;s happening at the very tippy top of the income distribution .
but it &apos;s acoustically engineered to focus the sound into the house and back to the stage . and here &apos;s an acoustic shelf .
do you know , in some states across america you need less identification to open up a company than you do to get a library card , like delaware , which is one of the easiest places in the world to set up an anonymous company .
all this is being recorded on her time log .
you might think that that &apos;s not a surprise .
( sighs ) ( laughter ) do you have a preference ? ( laughter )
it was an amazing feat .
this is a very unusual teacher who was a kindergarten and first-grade teacher , but was a natural mathematician .
i still remember this decisive moment .
your cat wants more food .
now , we like to think that technology creates jobs over a period of time after a short , temporary period of dislocation , and that is true for the frame of reference with which we all live , the industrial revolution , because that &apos;s precisely what happened .
so at stanford , we created this haptic edge display , which is a mobile device with an array of linear actuators that can change shape , so you can feel in your hand where you are as you &apos;re reading a book .
now each company handles it different ways .
girl 8 : well , sometimes there is a lot of stuff going on because i have music lessons and i &apos;m on swim team — all this different stuff that i have to do , and sometimes it gets overwhelming .
these plants occur in great diversity , over 28,000 species around the world .
he said a just society is a society that if you knew everything about it , you would be willing to enter it in a random place .
just a few moments .
but because the robots interact with each other , they sense their neighbors , they essentially follow .
notice those red marks .
so what i actually get , based on this lovely , smooth , desired force , is a very noisy version .
that &apos;s a lot more than conventional science has done .
and this links up with a lot of the other ideas that have been talked about .
so all these factors , and many more besides , we don &apos;t even fully understand some of them yet , these came together to defeat a monstrosity as big as bin ladenism , the global jihad , you needed this group effort .
now archie was a doctor , so he hung around with doctors a lot .
it &apos;s about understanding that people really don &apos;t want handouts , that they want to make their own decisions ; they want to solve their own problems ; and that by engaging with them , not only do we create much more dignity for them , but for us as well .
so , they did their work with kittens , with different kinds of deprivation regiments , and those studies , which date back to the &apos; 60s , are now being applied to human children .
and so they give us , through their dna , this precise model and measure of how to date and time these ancient geological events .
it used to be kind of two to one . now , humans are catching up .
and taking that into the world of climate change — which is , frankly , the mt . everest of all problems — just because we &apos;ve lived the way we have lived for so long , just because we have consumed the way we have for so long and populated the earth the way we have for so long , doesn &apos;t mean that we can carry on the way we are carrying on .
if you &apos;re seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles , some black circles , there &apos;s another way of seeing it .
so , i hope you &apos;ll turn this conference into that kind of movement forward .
it came out of the university of washington in seattle .
here &apos;s a building at oberlin college we designed that makes more energy than it needs to operate and purifies its own water .
first of all , you are not getting clips like that about four in the afternoon .
all those colors are ice and it goes up to about two miles thick , just a gigantic dome that comes in from the coast and rises in the middle .
that &apos;s kind of what it &apos;s like .
we think there &apos;s on the order — visible to the hubble space telescope , if you had the time to scan it around — about 100 billion galaxies . right ?
this sculpture is , of course , at the heart of all of it , and it &apos;s really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars .
i want that to happen .
but for that distinction between how things consciously seem and how they really are , you can &apos;t make that distinction for the very existence of consciousness , because where the very existence of consciousness is concerned , if it consciously seems to you that you are conscious , you are conscious .
you can see here , sometimes we needed something specific reflected in his eyes — usually eve .
it will not come from radio signals .
the degree of integrity that each of us can bring to the surface , to bring to this question , the depth of character that we can summon , as we show up for the question of how do we change — it &apos;s already defining us as individuals and as a nation , and it will continue to do that , on into the future .
let &apos;s use the market as the best listening device we have , and understand at what price people would pay for this , so they get the dignity of choice .
we then found corals that are of an intermediate age , and they show us that the ocean mixed partway through that climate transition .
cc : yeah . now pick the swing beat , and do the same thing . one , two , one , two , a-one-two-three-four . yeah . mm . one-two-three , one-two-three , one-two-three , one-two-three . whoo . so i want to take the second line beat and the swing beat and put them together ,
so many diseases were once thought of as psychological until science uncovered their biological mechanisms .
compare them to the tools our ancestors used ; they bear a striking resemblance to kanzi &apos;s .
my little seven-year-old picasso dreams were crushed .
how do you describe that ?
so this is just an example of what can happen when you bring the community together towards a common goal .
be relaxed .
several long-term studies have shown that girls who diet in their early teenage years are three times more likely to become overweight five years later , even if they started at a normal weight , and all of these studies found that the same factors that predicted weight gain also predicted the development of eating disorders .
he said , well , entropy increases because there are many , many more ways for the universe to be high entropy , rather than low entropy .
there was no cooked food .
but if this can happen in tasmanian devils , why hasn &apos;t it happened in other animals or even humans ?
they met when they all had small children , through a parenting class at a family resource center in san francisco .
&quot; well , &quot; he said , &quot; i once went 60 in a 40 . &quot;
she was sitting with someone who i presume was her mother , and they were talking about the novel , &quot; &quot; dune . &quot; &quot; they were both big fans , mother and daughter — very unusual .
how do you reconcile that ?
the internet is home to two billion people , or 30 percent of the world &apos;s population .
so , i think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit , a spirit that &apos;s been crushed doesn &apos;t have hope , it doesn &apos;t see beauty , it no longer has our natural , childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine .
the reality is that many white americans are affable and kind .
so we &apos;re going to make more of them .
it really is microsoft &apos;s office . it &apos;s adobe &apos;s photoshop .
and by the evening of that day , 70 children were all browsing .
now edward de bono argued that our brains are pattern matching machines .
but what if cats are hidden ?
so , i &apos;m curious about what &apos;s going to happen in the next 5,000 days .
you have to , of course , be aware of the needs of others , but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life and be of help to people .
would you rather be c or d ?
now i want to take you into the caldera .
but within 10 minutes , my father came outside , grabbed me by my forearm and led me into our room with an unfamiliar grip .
it is a tool to reimagine a world where black people are free to exist , free to live .
but what i have to do now , feeling again , what i &apos;ve got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzymes , of these triggers into something early on in the process , that you pick it up , not through your thinking , but through your feeling .
and not relating to people starts at a very early age .
and we &apos;ve also been trying to get computers out to the world , so that groups can communicate much more effectively , campaign much more effectively , but now we have the wonderful possibility , which is given to us from the mobile phone with the camera in it , because that is cheap ; it &apos;s ubiquitous ; and it &apos;s moving fast all around the world — and it &apos;s very exciting for us .
and just — i want him to understand what happens if she stays here .
leandro is an amazing guy in a slum in rio , and he created a recycling project in the slum .
and ultimately , because you can do this for the individual , we could even see this moving to the point where the ability to develop and test medicines will be you on a chip , what we &apos;re trying to say here is the individualizing of the process of developing drugs and testing their safety .
i saw one study that compared women in nigeria , one of the most chaotic and violent and corrupt and poorest countries in africa , to women in north america .
( laughter ) hp : ( in chinese ) yr : the only problem with masking it with chinese mandarin is i can only speak this paragraph , which i have learned by heart when i was visiting in china . ( laughter ) so all i can do is keep repeating it in different tones and hope you won &apos;t notice . ( laughter ) hp : ( in chinese ) ( laughter )
now , i think , in fact , we &apos;re at a turning point in human history , where we can finally now rebuild many of the institutions of the industrial age around a new set of principles .
yes , you can , and i &apos;ll show you in a second how to do that .
as isolated as these areas are , let me show you how the outside world is crowding in .
they said his head was up in space and they would bring him down to earth , essentially he came from nothing and that is what he was worth , he ’ d never get to go to university to learn , only degrees he ’ d ever show would be the first degree burns from those that came too close , they told him he was too bright , that ’ s why no one ever looked him in the eyes , his judgment became clouded so did the sky , with evaporated tears as the sun started to cry .
how do you try to get a handle on extraterrestrial life ?
that &apos;s how physics works : a single measurement can put us on the road to a new understanding of the universe or it can send us down a blind alley .
according to freedom house , the number of democracies went from 45 in 1970 to 115 in 2010 .
they put all their heads together and they decided that there was nothing that could be done for this surgeon who had essentially separated himself from the world , who by that time had become so overwhelmed , not just with depression and feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy , but with obsessional thinking , obsessional thinking about coincidences .
if you look at this picture , what you will see is a lot of dark with some light objects in it .
but i &apos;ve also , over the last year or so , got in touch with my inner tortoise .
as you see here , we had to develop a special rig to bring the scanner up close and personal .
this is the other context .
because what would happen if all of these individual so-called choices to have babies started to turn into individual choices not to have babies .
so there &apos;s a clear message : whether you care about a fundamental , basic research of really interesting , bizarre , wonderful animals , or you want to build a search-and-rescue robot that can help you in an earthquake , or to save someone in a fire , or you care about medicine , we must preserve nature &apos;s designs .
we thought this was emotion and we thought maybe emotions were transplanted with the heart . nope .
with a sample size of just one child , no matter how much we love her , you don &apos;t really have enough of a sample size to figure out what happens on average , but at two years old , she hasn &apos;t had an ear infection yet , so we &apos;re keeping our fingers crossed on that one .
i knew we &apos;d kick ass in the war with the leviathan force .
( laughter ) ks : now , the interesting thing about this is , you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to appreciate why a 10-foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting . ( laughter )
they harass you , right ? they call you , they say , &quot; &quot; i want to see your grades . how &apos;d you do on that last test ?
they can also choose not to do that , but those that go down that road may end up in a similar situation the wright brothers ended up with early last century , facing forcible measures by government . so they &apos;d better jump now .
we are all beginning to build technology that will enable us to return to the humanity that brought us where we are today — technology that will let us stop living inside this 2d world of monitors and pixels , and let us start remembering what it feels like to live in our 3d world .
we did it with 150 combat casualties in six weeks .
he &apos;s not greedy . he doesn &apos;t see skin color .
we ended up with 11 oscar nominations for these films .
i &apos;m saving you some brain activity , because you don &apos;t need to use your hair detector cells .
and i &apos;d like to run through a few of these today .
they &apos;re not under any illusions about what &apos;s happening .
it &apos;s really hard , but in essence , nerves from the brain go up into the nose and on these nerves exposed in the nose to the outside air are receptors , and odor molecules coming in on a sniff interact with these receptors , and if they bond , they send the nerve a signal which goes back into the brain .
and some of the largest projects in the country were being constructed through government-to-government arrangements with some of the leading countries in the world , the united states and britain and france and so on and so on .
three weeks later , i was healed , and i was back in high school .
ying solved this problem by insisting that all bows and arrows were designed identically , so they were interchangeable .
virtually all of you could , right ?
in north idaho , in my red pickup truck , i kept a notepad .
they are actually making urine .
so this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing at least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye .
with the siege on gaza , tunnels brought people all the basic needs like food , building material , other stuff we needed .
and before long , i was commuting between budapest , milan and florence .
you know what today &apos;s leadership is doing ? concave length .
and that worthy ambition became his lodestar .
i mean , think about how much we love this .
at five minutes to six in the afternoon , we come together at the natural history museum in rotterdam , the duck comes out of the museum , and we try to discuss new ways to prevent birds from colliding with windows .
when you go to the exhibition , you &apos;ll see the mermaid and the pool .
they had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments .
it &apos;s not different , it &apos;s the same stuff : calcium carbonate , calcium carbonate .
it &apos;s a very great honor for me to welcome onstage one of the greatest brazilian musicians of all time .
okay , see ? it &apos;s done . it &apos;s almost done . here we go .
you need more .
and they had just come down from the high pastures , at 18,000 feet .
do you think the world is going to be a better place next year ?
on the side here , this is temporal cortex .
i don &apos;t have time to explain it , but it has to do with dna and rna .
and it was really moving . and this picture here was taken the final night from a distant cliff about two miles away , where the contents of the capsule were being beamed into space .
and he whipped out his cellphone , dialed the number , and a voice said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m up here . &quot; &quot; and right on top of the nearest coconut tree , with a hatchet in one hand and a cell phone in the other , was a local toddy tapper , who proceeded to bring down the coconuts for us to drink .
the openings are letting the hot air out and light in .
you can make a biocensor out of yeast to detect pollutants in water .
alpha is the distribution of the sizes of attacks , which is really the distribution of the group strength carrying out the attacks .
and quite often we sit in a design meeting and we discover that there is this great idea .
and it is an awesome thing to be a part of empowering someone in this way .
and when you &apos;ve got that , you &apos;ve pretty much sacrificed any hope of making lots of money .
so you can look at that piece , but you can look at the other pieces too .
when we first put the mouse into this box , it &apos;s exploring , sniffing around , walking around , minding its own business , because actually by nature , mice are pretty curious animals .
now , all of the women , or most of the women in vermeer &apos;s other paintings wore velvet , silk , fur , very sumptuous materials .
but i think that it &apos;s quite interesting to know that there is really mathematical evidence to say that you should never let the sun go down on your anger .
there is jeopardy , and of course , the closer you get , it gets harder .
but they have other communication signals they use .
and here is the fruition of that in actuality .
and michael fleischman was another ph.d. student in my lab who worked with me on this home video analysis , and he made the following observation : that &quot; &quot; just the way that we &apos;re analyzing how language connects to events which provide common ground for language , that same idea we can take out of your home , deb , and we can apply it to the world of public media . &quot; &quot; and so our effort took an unexpected turn .
for the most basic , most common , most frustrating part of being a patient .
it ’ s a neural system that ’ s wired up to reward the brain for doing a grubby clerical job .
if you remember that bald guy , you &apos;ll know that what has been stripped off of these trunks in the pacific northwest old-growth forest is going to take decades and decades to come back .
it &apos;s happening to me , i know that &apos;s right .
once upon a time there &apos;s this happy little bacterium .
and then we stuck them under the steps .
i still had migraine headaches .
government institutions were completely decapitated , including the presidential palace .
( laughter ) it &apos;s really cool .
and i thought up a lot of ideas .
and my daughter — oh , surely she is extra-intelligent . &quot; &quot; and so on . so i suddenly figured that , how come all the rich people are having these extraordinarily gifted children ?
and i think it &apos;s because of what i &apos;m hearing today in ted talks .
it is to explain death to a child , and it deserves a piece of plain-song music . &quot; &quot; and my blood froze when i read that because i had written the plain-song music 130 years after he &apos;d written the letter .
if you do this , you surely will hit somewhere near the center .
and then when i got home , i sat down and i set myself to task to really try to create something just completely outside of the box .
and we lobbied on behalf of women &apos;s issues .
at dec , i worked on software for the new area of computerized typesetting .
and we &apos;ve seen that repeatedly through this conference , not just this year , but in past years .
so at the age of 14 my father had to work .
and the one thing i &apos;d like to point out here is that we &apos;ve done this before .
if they could do it for them , surely they could do it for me .
several scientific studies have shown that abnormal microrna expression levels varies and creates a unique , specific pattern for each type of cancer , even at the early stages , reflecting the progression of the disease , and whether it &apos;s responding to medication or in remission , making micrornas a perfect , highly sensitive biomarker .
( applause )
( applause ) i want to talk to you a little bit about user-generated content .
she had a spina bifida defect , a spinal cord abnormality .
and what kind of things were people talking about ?
eventually , though , paul thinks that she just figured that he was never going to survive .
you press start , nobody touches anything , and it can reach its destination fully autonomously .
( laughter ) i did that for two reasons .
our relationship is still important .
i &apos;m palestinian , muslim , i &apos;m female , i &apos;m disabled , and i live in new jersey .
in germany , scientists are starting to find evidence of autoimmunity , and in japan , of brain inflammation .
china &apos;s highest ruling body , the politburo , has 25 members .
but the most important thing we must do is , i think , we must all walk to the end of our lives and turn around , and ask ourselves a most fundamental question .
these ideas probably remind you of &quot; &quot; total recall , &quot; &quot; &quot; eternal sunshine of the spotless mind , &quot; or of &quot; &quot; inception . &quot; &quot; but the movie stars that we work with are the celebrities of the lab .
but it was interesting because i had some very preconceived notions about , for instance , evangelical christianity , and i found that it &apos;s such a wide and varied movement that it is difficult to make generalizations about it .
from astronauts &apos; experiences in space , we know that spending time in a microgravity environment means bone loss , muscle atrophy , cardiovascular problems , among many other complications that range for the physiological to the psychological .
so in other words , while our vascular system uses the three dimensions inside us , our urban transportation is mostly two-dimensional .
so i &apos;m on a mission to change that .
the first day they all came back .
but he doesn &apos;t know whether it &apos;s an infection , whether it &apos;s to do with malnutrition .
it &apos;s got an amazing user experience .
so inside our country , we are a net carbon sink .
this is my first trip , first time in life i &apos;m outside of the walls of gaza .
the monarch butterfly could be one of the 20 to 50 percent of all species that the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates will be ticketed for extinction by the end of the century if we stay on business-as-usual fossil fuel use .
but in the mean time , i &apos;m going to call on the worldwide education expert , who &apos;s my 10-year-old daughter , noa , to talk to you about why the boys in her class do worse .
which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice overload problem , which is concretization .
does it have to take a tragedy or a disaster for us to feel deeply connected as one species , as human beings ?
you were sleeping during that class .
who decides what reality is ?
and when the resources came , be it oil , we started building these fancy technologies and bringing people together because we needed the concentration .
then i ran 50 miles — ultramarathons .
another called maidsafe works on similar principles .
and she does really good business . in fact , i watched her walk through the streets hawking . and before you knew it , there was a crowd of women around her , buying these dresses .
on the top , now , that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through — the dotted line , the temperatures .
someone put up all the wikileaked cables from the state department , along with software used to interpret them , including my favorite use ever of the cablegate cables , which is a tool for detecting naturally occurring haiku in state department prose .
we &apos;re ready because we &apos;ve seen , in the financial crisis of 2008 , how our fetish for economic growth led us so far astray .
so you start with the personalized data where the speed limit on the road that you are at that point is 25 , and , of course , you &apos;re going faster than that .
ten years ago , on a tuesday morning , i conducted a parachute jump at fort bragg , north carolina .
well it means growing an actual heart , let &apos;s say , or grow a piece of bone that can be put into the body .
it &apos;s kind of like genomics .
they can detect credit card fraud and block spam and they can translate between languages .
the dot is visible whenever a cell fires an electrical impulse .
well , let me give you a demonstration of about 200 instruments we &apos;ve created so far for the laptop orchestra .
but i &apos;ve done more in the seven decades since that miserable day when my mother put me on the train than i would ever have dreamed possible .
i was a young australian woman doing extraordinary things in london .
and i realized that , when i &apos;d left the country , free and fair elections in a democratic environment were a dream .
so the best place for x-ray crystallography was at the cavendish laboratory at cambridge .
we might not ever know .
oh , look how it lies there .
mm : the medium does things to people and they are always completely unaware of this .
shit offends people . feces is too medical .
so , how do they do that ?
what they &apos;ve done is they &apos;ve shifted their operations .
thank you .
interestingly enough , an example : one young man who earned a c in the first course and wanted to go on to med school , we said , &quot; &quot; we need to have you retake the course , because you need a strong foundation if you &apos;re going to move to the next level . &quot; &quot; every foundation makes the difference in the next level .
but then one night , my mom was cooking grilled chicken for dinner , and i noticed that the edges of the chicken , which had been marinated in lemon juice , turned white .
we &apos;ve observed that the process of art therapy bypasses the speech-language issue with the brain .
hp : thank you . ( applause )
and the then-communications minister replied in a lordly manner that in a developing country communications are a luxury , not a right , that the government had no obligation to provide better service , and if the honorable member wasn &apos;t satisfied with his telephone , could he please return it , since there was an eight-year-long waiting list for telephones in india .
there was a great story of some little girl who they saved from leukemia by taking the blood out , editing it , and putting it back with a precursor of crispr .
i was one of the only kids in college who had a reason to go to the p.o. box at the end of the day , and that was mainly because my mother has never believed in email , in facebook , in texting or cell phones in general .
banking hasn &apos;t always been the way we read about it now in the newspapers .
or the man who decides that he is going to take his life , uses facebook as a way to say goodbye to friends and family .
now , let me ask you another question .
&quot; limpia &quot; means &quot; clean , &quot; because we want to empower and we want to inspire citizens .
language must have been useful for the genes .
and our work doesn &apos;t really resolve itself into a body in any way at all .
now smule &apos;s mission is to create expressive , mobile music things , and one of the first musical instruments we created is called ocarina .
it &apos;s a mystery .
children don &apos;t like it .
and then leilei — i know his other name — told us about interconnection , and how we &apos;re all totally interconnected here , and how we &apos;ve all known each other . and of course in the buddhist universe , we &apos;ve already done this already billions of times in many , many lifetimes in the past .
but the effect is relatively small .
so that &apos;s why the petitioner , the victims , the peasants , want to take the train to beijing to petition to the central government , they want the emperor to settle the problem .
they will enable compelling new concepts in how we design cities , work , and the way we live .
when play is about building a tower out of blocks , the kid begins to learn a lot about towers .
( laughter ) now how would you feel about handing your phone over ?
and what &apos;s happening here , this is where you &apos;ve actually elected to join that nike community . you &apos;ve bought into it .
person with the goods , person with the money , because they can &apos;t trust each other , are not going to exchange .
find the truth for yourself , and when you find the truth for yourself , there will be a truth in it , but it may contradict the plot , but don &apos;t worry about it . &quot; &quot; so , the sequel to &quot; &quot; elizabeth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; golden age . &quot; &quot; when i made the sequel to &quot; &quot; elizabeth , &quot; &quot; here was a story that the writer was telling : a woman who was threatened by philip ii and was going to war , and was going to war , fell in love with walter raleigh .
it takes really a lot of time and it &apos;s expensive to train the operator to operate this complex arm .
add on pandemic threat , you &apos;re in big trouble .
and i didn &apos;t know exactly why i had it , but it was so vivid .
and i thought , well , henry viii , okay .
and she &apos;s already at the nano .
did you touch it ?
boltzmann explained that if you start with low entropy , it &apos;s very natural for it to increase because there &apos;s more ways to be high entropy .
be a mentor .
es : i can see you . ( laughter ) ca : and who goes with the second choice , the fundamentally heroic act ?
when i enter into dialogue , i really hope that the other side would pick up my points of view , that i would impress upon them my opinions and my values .
so you imagine , if we &apos;re able to create a self-sustaining artificial life form , not only will this tell us about the origin of life — that it &apos;s possible that the universe doesn &apos;t need carbon to be alive ; it can use anything — we can then take &#91; it &#93; one step further and develop new technologies , because we can then use software control for evolution to code in .
now if i graph , for instance , some other technology , say transportation technology , on a semi-log curve , it would look very stupid , it would look like a flat line .
you can make objective claims about a domain that is subjective in its mode of existence , and indeed that &apos;s what neurologists do .
so nowadays in the operating room , we no longer need to use sunlight .
when you actually look at the motor of the world economy , it cannot move forward unless there is trade between the different countries .
remember that image from the beginning ?
ca : and then the only recourse is some form of forced migration .
using a grid the size of your thumb , with 32 electrodes on the surface of his brain , tim uses his thoughts to control an advanced prosthetic arm .
i remember thinking , my friend could have explained that entire experiment with a dance .
that means that by the age of five , you can &apos;t see as well for the rest of your life .
children are not adults .
light comes through , it bounces back off the layers ; it &apos;s called thin-film interference . imagine being able to self-assemble products with the last few layers playing with light to create color .
only months later , i discover who he really was .
there &apos;s other ways of making flaps .
richard dawkins : &quot; &quot; we &apos;ve evolved around courtship and sex , are attached to deep-rooted emotions and reactions that are hard to jettison overnight . &quot; &quot; david pizarro : so my favorite part of this clip is that professor dawkins actually gagged .
after a while , i got a bit — i wanted to go somewhere else .
i am going to tell you how i do it and the most important thing i &apos;ve learned .
i have no idea how that works . we &apos;ll send that over there .
with those three systems , you have what is always necessary — a level of redundancy that says , if one system fails , you &apos;ll still have a way to make sure that you &apos;re being controlled .
and the very best of luck to you .
and as the sandstone weathers , new grains break free .
but he experiences himself , his thoughts and feelings , as something separate from the rest ...
but some of you might not know that the arm itself can actually regenerate a complete starfish .
we got a survey done on medical conditions with people who have similar issues , and i look at medical records , and i say , wouldn &apos;t it be amazing if everyone &apos;s medical records were available anonymously to research doctors ?
the year is 2005 .
somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles .
the world that meant a lot to me , i saw it vanish in my face .
kallikuppam had caught up with my control school in new delhi , a rich private school with a trained biotechnology teacher .
he was a very selfish meme .
on average , there &apos;s one within 20 to 30 miles of wherever you are in the united states .
the employment in the rich countries will go down from about 800 to about 700 million of these people .
but in order to try and explain the whole thing , i would need another 18 minutes or so to do it , so you &apos;re just going to have to take it on trust from me on this occasion , and let me assure you that all of these issues are involved in cybersecurity and control of the internet one way or the other , but in a configuration that even stephen hawking would probably have difficulty trying to get his head around .
now if we look forward a bit to the 19th century , we find a new style of technology .
( laughter ) voice : look at my smile .
she still made the two-hour trek to the schoolhouse and tried to catch every little bit of information that seeped out of the doors .
pope francis , who has made such a difference to this whole issue , visited tacloban right after that .
so we better find out what the target is soon . &quot; &quot; so we extracted and decompiled the attack code , and we discovered that it &apos;s structured in two digital bombs — a smaller one and a bigger one .
people &apos;s states of their own body changed how they perceived the environment .
that &apos;s what happens to me . it kind of ruins my whole week , because whatever i &apos;ve got planned that week is kind of out the window .
there was just no future .
and many advances now , we can do that fairly readily .
there &apos;s 7.3 billion people in the world today ; there will be 9.6 billion by 2050 .
and humans dispersed — not once , but twice .
i don &apos;t think so .
the government recently announced plans to return to the moon by 2024 .
and so immediately as you meet people , you shake their hand , and then your eyes go to their shoulder , because you want to see where did they serve , or what unit did they serve with ?
i met humble people .
now , i get to the final thing , which is the set of which my name is attached .
the second stage was completed at the penn state university main campus lab , which is where i extracted the chemicals , changed the ph so i could run it through the equipment and separated the compounds i needed from the rest of the chicken .
and then when rockefeller center said , nbc , could you put this thing up on the walls ? we were delighted .
but the most surprising part was when we turned to , what are we going to work on in the week ahead ?
so what we did was put all the instructions online as open source .
health studies from the region are conflicting and fraught .
therefore , they asked their parents to go down to the streets and collect them , bring them back home .
and , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time .
( laughter ) this was a fun one .
those are their expectations of who you are , not yours .
( laughter ) don &apos;t go asking for a frappuccino there .
it doesn &apos;t , i agree , look very much .
i &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; wow , that was great — ( laughter ) — please lady , don &apos;t say another word . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and the camera is down at her , and this guy has to put the microphone in her face , said , &quot; &quot; what do you mean by that ? &quot; &quot; and i figured , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all over now , &quot; &quot; and she looks up and she says , &quot; &quot; well , &quot; &quot; she &apos;s still watching these guys go ; she says , &quot; &quot; i can &apos;t ride a bike , &quot; &quot; no , she says , &quot; &quot; i can &apos;t use a skateboard , and i &apos;ve never used roller blades , &quot; &quot; she knew them by name ; she says , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s been 50 years since i rode a bicycle . &quot; &quot; then she looks up , she &apos;s looking up , and she says ,
when we originally looked at bringing civil actions against terrorists , everyone thought we were a bit mad and mavericks and crackpots . now it &apos;s got a title . everyone &apos;s doing it .
i make the dove appear .
there &apos;s a bit of randomness here too because , when i was beginning independent diplomat , i went to a party in the house of lords , which is a ridiculous place , but i was holding my drink like this , and i bumped into this guy who was standing behind me .
and so many opportunities get missed when that happens .
( laughter ) which tells you something about our place in the universe .
why strangeness ? because our social relations are increasingly mediated by data , and data turns our social relations into digital relations , and that means that our digital relations now depend extraordinarily on technology to bring to them a sense of robustness , a sense of discovery , a sense of surprise and unpredictability .
most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day .
and i &apos;m grateful .
here &apos;s the idea .
what about global politics ?
the only thing that they don &apos;t have is access to resources . they don &apos;t even have a textbook sometimes , and they don &apos;t even have a proper curriculum .
so , there &apos;s going to be a tremendous struggle .
sughar is a local word used in many , many languages in pakistan .
and by seven minutes and 30 seconds , they had to pull my body out and bring me back .
the same is true every time as i started thinking about information .
vertically , you have the time .
i taped my aunt . i taped my aunt singing a song in russian from the — you know , could we have it for a second ?
the shipping lanes have been moved .
ag : that &apos;s right .
you &apos;re literally in your own world .
so there &apos;s some problem with these metrics now .
so this is what we hope to do in the next few years .
and some people will get people to be on the other team .
she &apos;s carrying all the weight through harnesses .
i can &apos;t wait to find out what it looks like .
&quot; &quot; pickpocket &quot; &quot; started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement .
so the smell of vanilla , that might change the four on the left to brown and the one on the right to yellow . this matrix can produce thousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells .
i have a wonderful visit to facebook hq coming up .
( applause ) so let me tell you a little bit how this was done .
because when we looked at the four platforms around the site , one of which is an upgrade of the families &apos; platform , we knew that these had to be moveable to respond to changing conditions , and the changing definition of what ground zero is .
and that &apos;s the difference between problems that are additive , like co2 , which we go slowly up and then we tip , and problems that are depletive , in which we lose what we have , which oscillate , and they oscillate until we lose everything we &apos;ve got .
but i think that glamour actually has a much broader meaning — one that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters , but also comes in other forms .
for myself , i tried to get away from infectious diseases , and i didn &apos;t .
let &apos;s start here .
and that led to all kinds of things , from being in curricula in universities and schools to — one of my favorite pictures i have from south asia , it was a couple of men with long beards and a lot of girls wearing the hijab — it looked like a school .
there was shared attention looking at the same sort of thing , and recognizing socially communicated reinforcement at the end .
and all of the data , we aligned based on the following idea : every time my son would learn a word , we would trace back and look at all of the language he heard that contained that word .
here &apos;s a question that matters .
one way of thinking about it is to imagine what it would be like if language — where it could only be used literally .
and so does every wild habitat on the planet , like the amazon rainforest you &apos;re hearing behind me .
what we can measure is that tangible stuff at the bottom of the pyramid .
and , so now , when the polar ice caps melt , my recording studio will rise up like an ark , and i &apos;ll float off into the drowned world like a character from a j.g. ballard novel .
the more stress , the less brain development , which in turn causes less adaptability and causes higher stress levels .
why do many people believe that india is still a growth disaster ?
then we can actually see that what started out as just straight lines is actually a curve called a parabola .
we have to have treatment centers , specialized ebola treatment centers , where the workers can be protected as they try to provide support to the people who are infected , so that they might survive the disease .
at the present time , my collaborators and i , what we &apos;re aiming for is much more modest — just to find partial connectomes of tiny chunks of mouse and human brain .
probably the largest urban-renewal project , i think , ever attempted on the planet .
( applause )
this was taken in the riviera sugar factory in red hook , brooklyn .
john mccain .
and that i do .
the words &quot; &quot; water &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; dry &quot; &quot; do not match , right ?
and then he got so excited , he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better , and the giant didn &apos;t run away , so he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible , bringing a creature of legend from the misty history into high-resolution video .
his father was an sob , and , in fact , he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood , but then we were off and running .
you know , she was very chic , but she was very filled with ennui , you know .
and every now and then , find a friend , find a turtle , and take a long , slow walk .
they comment on politics , they cry out against the evils of congress .
so this was how the finished shot appeared in the film .
because by definition , news is something that almost never happens .
well , as a synonym , they often use ambiences .
all of origami comes from that .

but i &apos;m also happy and honored to be up here and i think that it &apos;s great that i got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and i &apos;d had more agency in my career , because maybe then i wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how i got my first job , or maybe i wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how i paid for college , which seems so important right now .
av : we , or i ?
you &apos;re saying hey , you know , i don &apos;t think i &apos;m going to need them , so i &apos;m just going to trust that , you know , let &apos;s get rid of them , it doesn &apos;t really matter , these guys are going to do the right thing .

and so i &apos;m so excited to discuss this with them , and i come in and i say , &quot; &quot; can somebody please explain the main ideas and why this is so cool ? &quot; &quot; there &apos;s silence .
well , i think what part of the problem is that , in haiti , although the problem is huge , somehow we understand it , it &apos;s localized .
proximate self-similarity . and that accounts for this phenomenon .
it &apos;s a different way of thinking about it , but i think it &apos;s kind of beautiful , because it is certainly far more inclusive than the us-versus-them or the abled-versus-the-disabled , and it &apos;s a lot more honest and respectful of the fragility of life .

i graduated high school in may , and — ( laughter ) ( applause ) — i graduated high school in may , and i decided that i was going to start up a company to commercialize these technologies that i &apos;ve developed , these revolutionary detectors for scanning cargo containers and these systems to produce medical isotopes , but i want to do this , and i &apos;ve slowly been building up a team of some of the most incredible people i &apos;ve ever had the chance to work with , and i &apos;m really prepared to make this a reality .
this uses 20 times less energy for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car , which means not only is this thing fast to charge and really cheap to build , but it also reduces the footprint of your energy use in terms of your transportation .

pew research did a study of 10,000 american adults , and they found that at this moment , we are more polarized , we are more divided , than we ever have been in history .
that code looks pretty much like all the other code on that system .
but i didn &apos;t get it .
i became obsessed with the object — not just the beautiful photograph itself , and the color , the shallow depth of field , the detail that &apos;s visible , the wire you can see on the beak there that the conservator used to put this skeleton together — there &apos;s an entire story here .

how much is your field talking to great marketers about their insights into human psychology ?
so , it &apos;s a full range of facial expressions simulating all the major muscles in the human face , running on very small batteries , extremely lightweight .
like i &apos;ll read that one of the two attributes of matter in the newtonian universe — there are two attributes of matter in the newtonian universe — one is space occupancy . matter takes up space .
i &apos;m talking here a little bit about display technologies .
most of them explode spontaneously in contact with air , and when you call up the companies , they only give you minimum ten tons , ok ?

( applause ) it &apos;s nothing we had to do about this .
this is the muktuk , or the blubber , all lined up for community distribution .

and another man looked in my direction and said , &quot; yes , there he is . he &apos;s on this elevator with us . &quot;
now , the commodity exchange itself , that concept , is not new to the world .
he said , &quot; &quot; if i keep tossing myself off i get fresh sperm being made . &quot; &quot; which i thought was an interesting idea , theory .
so out of all these planets out there , and the variety is just simply astonishing , we mostly want to find the planets that are goldilocks planets , we call them .
and i would like you to join with all of humanity to draw a line in the sand and say , &quot; &quot; no more .
and i might add , by the way , over half of us are women .

in gando , there was no electricity , no access to clean drinking water , and no school .
so the myth here is that the left brain is logical , it &apos;s good with equations like this , and the right brain is more creative , so the right brain is better at music .
it blows my mind away that we can now quantify something as personal as our emotions , and we can do it at this scale .
now this is not something that &apos;s ready for the public , but it is in working progress .
our cultural imagination about compassion has been deadened by idealistic images .
and for this reason , they were deeply disturbed , deeply alarmed and the entire epidemic was unraveling in front of them .

we brought musicians to the canopy , and they made their music — and it &apos;s fantastic music .
( applause ) ls : let me show you the experimental results .
i didn &apos;t have to try to flap my wings .
we have thousands and thousands of european fighters in syria and in iraq , so this is not something that you solve by just not allowing syrians to come in .
just as we can &apos;t predict what one molecule in a gas will do — it &apos;s hopeless to predict a single molecule — yet we can predict the properties of the whole gas , using thermodynamics , very accurately .
lp : well , i think for me , this is kind of one of the most exciting things i &apos;ve seen in a long time .

not just translate them , but interpret them .
( sa : customizable for the boss of your choice . ) dk : and of course : a hammock for your afternoon nap that stretches across your cubicle .
it &apos;s called momentum .
and now string theory comes along and says , yes , gravity , quantum mechanics , electromagnetism , all together in one package , but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see .
so it was not easy at all .
so i &apos;m going to show you a few examples of what we can do .
( laughter ) so let me tell you what aroused such irate responses , and i &apos;ll let you decide if whether they — the claims are really that outrageous .
now i don &apos;t mean extra gills or something — something we care about , like aging .
they did not get me any closer to understanding why i thought i recognized this one particular poem .
consider the memory of long temporal sequences of movements , like a pianist playing a beethoven sonata .
we homo sapiens are the only species we know of that is driven to scientific inquiry .

ta-da !
this is the work i made out of that material .
the european union ets is the main marketplace .

the frequent furl of five fingers , the chips in my teeth come from biting at all the many things a solitary hand cannot open .
it just sucked me in immediately , as if i began preparing myself as a patient to die according to the schedule that they had just given to me , until i met a patient named verna in a waiting room , who became a dear friend , and she grabbed me one day and took me off to the medical library and did a bunch of research on these diagnoses and these diseases , and said , &quot; &quot; eric , these people who get this are normally in their &apos; 70s and &apos; 80s .
so there you go . my name is john hodgman .
momentum was being built .
a couple years later , my dad took me to a film called &quot; &quot; excalibur . &quot; &quot; i actually got him to take me to it twice , which is no small thing , because it is a hard , r-rated film .
hollow organs have a much higher degree of complexity , because you &apos;re asking these organs to act on demand .
( laughter ) now , at harvard , we learned by the case method .
even though it &apos;s earth-like , and even though early in its history it may very well have harbored earth-like life , it soon succumbed to runaway greenhouse — that &apos;s an 800 degrees &#91; fahrenheit &#93; surface — because of rampant carbon dioxide .
we &apos;ve had people pretend that this is a problem that &apos;s been fixed .
a virus grabbed onto a bacterium and it slipped its dna into it .
it &apos;s equally testable .
each camera was covering 60 degrees of his head , so that in post-production we could use pretty much any angle we needed , and we shot only his head .
i &apos;ve learned that borders are where the actual ends , but also where the imagination and the story begins .

that &apos;s all true .
this world that you &apos;re going to be talking about tomorrow is going to be completely integrated . you &apos;re not going to be a pilot , you &apos;re going to be a passenger .
and they will be able to jump right into the project and start working on it without asking anybody &apos;s permission .
that education will work better if we &apos;ve got electricity and railroads , and so on .
but they lose , right ?
but if you get the kiss in three days , well that &apos;s three days of jittery anticipation , the thrill of the wait .
so luke , you go to your communications professors — you &apos;re majoring in communications — and you ask them for permission to come to ted , which might have a little bit to do with communications , and what was their reaction ?
second , you need to reenforce integrators .
so , bad news first .
so millions of viewers are watching those episodes .
so you say to yourself , &quot; &quot; well , that &apos;s worth something . &quot; &quot; so you go back into the room , and you break this thing to pieces , and you haul it away .
a lot of experts were saying it was impossible , and my mum certainly wasn &apos;t very keen on the idea .
ok , but he &apos;s losing ground here .
and the biggest problem is that overall , they &apos;ve appropriated the largesse of the digital age asymmetrically : we have wealth creation , but we have growing social inequality .
ha ha . no , no , no .
now , about that cow model i talked about .
the blade fell , the head fell into a basket , out of sight immediately , and they called out , &quot; give me back my gallows , give me back my wooden gallows . &quot;
but the good news is that decades of development and research have led to a lot of new technologies and knowledge that allow us to do a lot better .
and second , it was not restricted to pairs of people .
( applause ) yeah , but there were hundreds of individuals , obviously , who made that a reality .
i &apos;m feeling the sonic world around me .
this is another cartoon from &quot; &quot; the rejection collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; too snug ? &quot;
but while the west has opened on sex , what we found is that arab societies appear to have been moving in the opposite direction .
we need to employ someone to glue and to screw the sole of the feet .
computers control our military equipment , everything from missile silos to satellites to nuclear defense networks .
each of those is an outcome ; you would like something to happen .
and then we grow these things , and we tell people , back in the countries where these seeds have come from , &quot; &quot; look , actually we &apos;re not just storing this to get the seeds later , but we can give you this information about how to germinate these difficult plants . &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s already happening .
and this ideagora that he created , an open market , agora , for uniquely qualified minds , was part of a change , a profound change in the deep structure and architecture of our organizations , and how we sort of orchestrate capability to innovate , to create goods and services , to engage with the rest of the world , in terms of government , how we create public value .
the worst part was this year was the year where they decided to do a big cleanup operation on mt . everest .
so during a two-hour race , each car will be sending 750 million numbers .
maybe i should get away from this map completely , and really be honest about wanting to show you my favorite bits and pieces of rome and simply kick a soccer ball in the air — which happens in so many of the squares in the city — and let it bounce off of things . and i &apos;ll simply explain what each of those things is that the soccer ball hits .
you can say , &quot; &quot; give a muffin to a mouse , &quot; &quot; the prepositional dative .
instead , our eeg scans revealed very specific problems hidden within their brains that couldn &apos;t possibly have been detected by their behavioral assessments .
i &apos;m as certain of that as i was of the success that we &apos;ve had with direct television broadcasting , sirius xm .
looking at the entire facade — there were 70 total windows — and i knew what i had to do .
so that &apos;s my point , that you can have a big effect on these kids .
and finally , well , isn &apos;t this just intuition ?
it &apos;s been missing in much of the architecture , because we think architecture is the realm of the neutered , the realm of the kind of a state that has no opinion , that has no value .
they see us as adults , rational adults .
it would be really great if you didn &apos;t let people divide the world into the creatives and the non-creatives , like it &apos;s some god-given thing , and to have people realize that they &apos;re naturally creative .
but seriously , seriously , we did get along , because we had a common goal of wanting to inspire these young people .
so i want to give a little bit of a different perspective of how we can perhaps look at these things in a little bit of a different way .
inside there , on these two opposite sides , there is the secret of translation .
what happens in one place very quickly affects everything else .
and lastly , the only portrait of a male that leonardo painted , &quot; &quot; the musician . &quot; &quot; before we go into these faces , i should explain why i have some right to talk about them .
no crows are brought up .
but really , if we &apos;re all going to be honest with ourselves , i have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with , was it .
now let &apos;s stop and think about it for a minute .
and i select &quot; &quot; it &apos;s embarrassing . &quot; &quot; and then i &apos;m encouraged to message my friend , but here &apos;s the critical difference .

and i feel like we &apos;re sort of at the point now where we need to make that choice of what kind of future we want to be living in .
jf : you spell it right out — lt : i spell it , every letter .
( laughter ) now this may be a way of saying &quot; &quot; pure beings &quot; &quot; — like in angels — or it may be like the greek kouros or kórē , an eternal youth .
that &apos;s my question .
using this technology , the specialists at ucla medical center were able to identify where that compression in the hose pipe was occurring .
things are changing and today , on the united nations statistic division home page , it says , by first of may , full access to the databases .
if you &apos;re like most people , just seeing that gave you a small sense of elation and joy — just to think about making 50 percent more money in retirement than before .

if you are a latina , we &apos;re at 54 cents .
this judge is someone you &apos;d never want to play poker with .
and looking back , he said to me that , yes , proust was right that at 22 , we are sure we will not die , just as a thanatologist named edwin shneidman was right that at 90 , we are sure we will .
31 is a prime number , and that five in the power is also a prime number .
but we take the severe ones , and we reschedule the other ones the next day .
and we actually had to install white walls to separate these pieces , which didn &apos;t belong together .
we can look at all 10 million synapses now .
this guy . who is he ? he &apos;s the critic .
in fact , no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all .

i just fell in love with the culture and the people .
no masks ...
and i &apos;m going to break it down for you for just a second .
the big challenge became actually taking the pictures through that telescope .

let &apos;s see , should we order that all pets be kept indoors ?
ca : that &apos;s not 30 percent a year , that &apos;s — ms : yes , thirty percent a year .
but they want it to be easy , affordable and attractive , and they expect business to help , and they &apos;re a little bit disappointed today .
so what does the eight-year-old do ?
and this question is really what i want to talk about today .
so i looked for furniture .
what if we reorganized this approach ?
the pictures that came a bit later had a very simple reason .
that &apos;s a huge statement on how broken the indian public education system is .
she launches this thing above the spanish steps and sets off for an aerial tour of the city .
i didn &apos;t ask you to chant it because it &apos;s true ; i just want you to remember it .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated entities offers a new palette for aesthetic expression .
we conducted months of user research overseas , trying to think like designers , human-centered design — &quot; let &apos;s figure out what people want . &quot;
and of of the criticisms is this idea of merit .
design &apos;s power of synthesis is just an attempt to put at the innermost core of architecture the force of life .
what &apos;s the population of the earth ?
the effects of personal stress and social stigmas are a deadly combination .
to do this , we extracted enzymes from our bacteria and reacted with an intermediate of phthalic acid .
and it &apos;s something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
we &apos;re sometimes contacted by people in other parts of the world who can &apos;t travel to the united states , but would like to hear this record .
now , fast-forward to today and this is what you see : the 15 million cell phones a month .
and people said , &quot; &quot; oh that &apos;s a very very large space that you &apos;re asking for . &quot; &quot; and we said , &quot; &quot; what if we had proven that in the same space we found oil for the country for the next hundred years ? &quot; &quot; and they said , &quot; &quot; we tried . there isn &apos;t any . &quot; &quot; we said , &quot; &quot; no no , but what if we prove it ? &quot; &quot; and they said , &quot; &quot; well you can dig . &quot; &quot; and we decided to dig up , instead of digging down .
but the window of opportunity was innovation and new mindset , which today has led to a completely new governance strategy to build resilience , acknowledge redundancy and invest in the whole system as an integrated whole , and then allow for much more redundancy in the system .
and then i swap it out with the students and actually re-release that carbon black .
so , tissue design .
i myself am now collecting these cool pyrex containers and using those instead of glad and tupperware containers to store food in .
but a few years ago , i noticed a disturbing trend in leadership preparation .
so , music videos are something that i always found interesting , but they always seem to be so reactive .
by the way , check out my sweet ride . ( laughter ) since birth , we have both suffered from the inability to fly on our own .
that &apos;s not true of the robot .
that &apos;s a four percent reduction per year — and this , with measuring .
now the staggering system , not just that this worked in everquest , but that today , a decade on , every single video game in the world with this kind of task uses a version of this system — tens of millions of people .
remember we used to throw things away , and we &apos;d point to away ?
luckily , there are millions and millions of geniuses willing to gift us with their best ideas .
but what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily ?
today &apos;s commercial markets worldwide , global commercial launch market ?
and importantly , those bits of dna are passed on to the cells &apos; progeny , so cells are protected from viruses not only in one generation , but over many generations of cells .
( laughter ) so — ( applause ) but what are some other tools or hacks that sound designers use ?
and there was a young girl named jaclyn .
and so , what i &apos;d like to do now is to tell you about what we &apos;ve learned in those journeys .
so i took one &quot; &quot; no &quot; &quot; off a tombstone from the islamic museum in cairo , and i added a message to it : &quot; no to military rule . &quot;
and somebody like dr. victoria hale , who started the world &apos;s first nonprofit pharmaceutical company , and whose first drug will be fighting visceral leishmaniasis , also known as black fever .
so we could either take something long and make it a topic , like with the railway and the hurtigruten , or we could take a topic and make it long .
( laughter ) this is a very different demographic .
it is simply how we protect our walls .
they &apos;ve been doing it since 1948 , and what they show consistently throughout is that it &apos;s almost impossible to find americans who are consistent ideologically , who consistently support , &quot; &quot; no we mustn &apos;t tax , and we must limit the size of government , &quot; &quot; or , &quot; &quot; no , we must encourage government to play a larger role in redistribution and correcting the ills of capitalism . &quot; &quot; those groups are very , very small .
and it &apos;s moving through us , this self-organization , and we &apos;re extending and accelerating it , and we can be part of it by aligning the technology that we make with it .
we can design new materials , new products , and new facilities .
now , being a biologist , i was very curious about this .
he now has a chain of restaurants .
and right now this is in the okavango delta in botswana .
that &apos;s good .
so , we &apos;ll click ford , and now that becomes the center .
what it &apos;s telling us is that capitalism is going to become more social .
and we think people like this probably don &apos;t want to vote for people who look like this and are named barack obama .
first of all , there &apos;s the object in the world .
from tobacco to lead poisoning to hiv / aids , the united states actually has quite a strong track record with addressing public health problems , but replicating those successes with aces and toxic stress is going to take determination and commitment , and when i look at what our nation &apos;s response has been so far , i wonder , why haven &apos;t we taken this more seriously ?
so on the subject of deception , i wanted to quote one of my favorite authors .
it &apos;s about fighting them on contemporary battlefields .
i wanted to get back where the romance was .
second , we are both responsible for and the victims of our own pollution .
now i have beaten a song back into you .
miranda : do you love me ?
it was proceeding at moore &apos;s law pace , but then in 2008 , something changed .
however , my boss always asked if i had the data to prove it would sell , and asked me to think of product development after analyzing market data .
they are our body &apos;s own repair kits , and they &apos;re pluripotent , which means they can morph into all of the cells in our bodies .
it was approaching 11 when i exited right toward afula , and passed a large quarry and was soon in kfar kara .
but if you take a lens , like that , this line is ack , ack , ack , ack , ack . like that .
so roughly five liters of air per breath , 17 breaths per minute of the 525,600 minutes per year , comes to approximately 45 million liters of air , enriched 100 times in carbon dioxide , just for you .
larry , you can explain this one .
it gives you a sense of the scale , and it doesn &apos;t look anything like the others .
now that would give you an unfair advantage . &quot; &quot; he sued , and his case went all the way to the supreme court , believe it or not , the case over the golf cart , because the law says that the disabled must be accommodated , provided the accommodation does not change the essential nature of the activity .
so we gave them some more tasks to deal with , and what we did here is we turned the world under their feet . and watch its response .
and the big goal here is to take inspiration from animals to make robots that can handle complex terrain — stairs , mountains , forests , places where robots still have difficulties and where animals can do a much better job .
( laughter ) as you can see , these are all maps .
animators had to actually animate them .
and this just came off last september at ars electronica ; we repeated it in england .
thank you .
most politicians in my country want to roll back the drug war now , put fewer people behind bars , not more , and i &apos;m proud to say as an american that we now lead the world in reforming marijuana policies .
i mean , just incredible to see bunches of gharial basking on the river again .
( applause )
we need better tools .
one billion — that &apos;s more than ever before — because of gross inequalities in distribution , not tonnage .
income there stayed stagnant , as it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world .
it &apos;s called the norden mark 15 bombsight .
they integrated with the building in really peculiar ways .
india has many because they are many .
and here we are frantically building these experiments , doing these calculations , writing these computer codes .
and this tenuous veneer around our planet is what allows life to flourish .
his story is their story .
because the social progress index also has some very good news .
it says exactly the same thing : poor kids lose ground in the summertime .
it wasn &apos;t clear .
now during the clinical trial , she &apos;d been given all her antiretroviral drugs free of charge , and her transportation costs had been covered by the research funds .
the dead zone , it turns out , is full of life .
it was less than i would pay for a bar of chocolate at home .
they were almost entirely replaced with fossil fuels , and so the consequence was that we wiped out almost as much clean energy electricity that we get from solar .
there &apos;s a whole variety of other reasons why property rights sometimes don &apos;t work in these cases , but they do need security of tenure .
and the fact that france has put food at the center of the g20 is really important .
and it won &apos;t be done .
that &apos;s very important to us .
we are missing a completely other side of wars .
but here &apos;s the problem : to catch cat fleas is difficult .
however , his chin skin doesn &apos;t look the same as it did before .
can biotechnology be used to create work as moving as music ?
at worst , they &apos;re throwaways , they &apos;re for amusement .
thank you very much .
could we use , let &apos;s say , pharmacological drugs to activate or inactivate brain cells ?
two ? so you should have sat down earlier .
inside the virtual newsroom , the reporters could gather around the themes that were emerging from the documents .
so what do you do ?
i didn &apos;t want to stand out in the crowd anymore .
look at the toxic mix of unemployed graduates on our streets , while employers say they cannot find the people with the skills they need .
i &apos;ve got something to show you .
do what you can . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so they do what they can .
and then he breathed his last , with loved ones around him , and i know that he had chicken soup also , as his last meal . &quot; &quot; i happen to know it for a fact .
there &apos;s some arduino balls collecting data and sort of measuring some parameters .
there &apos;s one last elephant in the room , the proteins themselves , which come from algae and bacteria and fungi , and all over the tree of life .
it &apos;s china , india , russia .
( applause )
now that last mile , last foot , in a sense , is the first step of the infrastructure .
and i was thinking , how many terrorists could i possibly play before turning into one myself ?
but for molecular programming , our question is , how many molecules do we need to put in that seed to get a cell phone ?
so , this is the message of desert .
we don &apos;t even need that much time to do amazing things .
and they react . they told me what is possible , what is impossible .
now , some people call her the first programmer .
now you might look at this result and say , okay , sure , on average people are less happy when they &apos;re mind-wandering , but surely when their minds are straying away from something that wasn &apos;t very enjoyable to begin with , at least then mind-wandering should be doing something good for us .
we &apos;re connecting with something important inside of us .
much better for everybody to go off by themselves , generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics , and then come together as a team to talk them through in a well-managed environment and take it from there .
right ? all of those are man-made , artificiality brought into the woods by you , and by the very nature of being there .
we predict his eye color .
there &apos;s a ted talk on motivation that debunks that we work for money , and it presents science on how we &apos;re really motivated by three things , in terms of larger creative tasks , when we work for something bigger than ourselves .
( music ) and i &apos;m going to slow it down because things sound cooler when they &apos;re slower . ( music )
and then came the long ...
( applause )
of course , it doesn ’ t matter , because it could also be that they ’ re not .
in fact , we don &apos;t know about any life beyond earth ,
this is a place called the madangiri settlement colony , which is a very developed slum about 25 minutes outside new delhi , where i met these characters who showed me around for the day .
ask them really interesting questions .
three , property rights .
there were numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment : burning at the stake , disemboweling , breaking on the wheel , being pulled apart by horses and so on .
i invite you to literally share the narratives that you create on our facebook page for citizen university .
so here &apos;s my wife &apos;s bad knee on the left , and her just hiking now four months later in aspen , and doing well .
so these projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots — 8 ft . , 12 ft. long proteins .
and we &apos;ve heard those things about &quot; &quot; is it nurture or is it nature , &quot; &quot; right ?
but what good is this for the worm ?
and the benefit to the sponsors is the sum of the publicity and societal benefits over the long term .
bang ! the gun goes off .
none of them are taught in cooking schools .
and so the next time you meet someone , a stranger , one request : understand that you live in the subjective truth , and so does he .
and these technologies are going to be marketed to all of us as panaceas for deceit , and they will prove incredibly useful some day .
this cloud is completely , 100 percent artificial .
if your enemy was really happy , why would they bother to be your enemy ?
and this has unleashed tremendous energy .
and what i see is that the animal &apos;s brain sets up its initial processing of that sound in a form that &apos;s idealized , within the limits of its processing achievements to represent it in an organized and orderly way .
talk to me . yes . yes . you can say yes .
( laughter ) sw : what about a skunk ?
and they were all eager to learn so they could finish the game as well .
and that &apos;s what it looked like .
no one outside of our lab has seen these yet .
there are lots of ways we have of avoiding and numbing and bypassing pain , but the point of all of this is to deal with the cause of the problem .
so in one of their projects called southwark circle , they worked with residents in southwark , south london and a small team of designers to develop a new membership organization to help the elderly with household tasks .
people are a little risk-averse . so what ?
and that gives me hope because people are not purely selfish .
i check and — ( applause ) i check that email account religiously all the time .
and , in fact , there &apos;s been an interesting coevolution that &apos;s been going on between wolfram alpha and its human users , and it &apos;s really encouraging .
there are so many reasons why we can &apos;t be , indeed , we &apos;re not sure why we should be .
but they &apos;re very small , you know ?
but we &apos;re beginning to see a sea change .
and they use low-intensity electric fields to fight cancer .
but the media lab is an interesting place , and it &apos;s important to me because as a student , i was a computer science undergrad , and i discovered design later on in my life .
indeed , we designed it together with neurobiologists to understand how animals move , and especially how the spinal cord controls locomotion .
and then you put tree seeds in here , and then you end up growing — potentially — an old-growth forest from a cardboard box .
well the act of drawing airplanes led me to , when i had the opportunity to choose a course in school , led me to sign up for aeronautical engineering .
and his design skills — improbable though it sounds — would be essential in enabling him to do so .
but then i would discover something new and totally different , and i would dive into that .
and so , anuj and acumen have been talking about testing the private sector , because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that , look , in a country like tanzania , 80 percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day .
i hit the gun club .
but they can adapt only so far , and then when all the water is gone from the surface , microbes have only one solution left : they go underground .
so this is for real .
what is the default setting if people do nothing , if they keep procrastinating , if they don &apos;t check the boxes ?
why did we ever do it ?
we &apos;re looking to see if we can take captured co2 , which can easily be piped to sites , convert that co2 back into fuel to drive this process .
but we break it down to some basic realities .
we call it the cloud of normality .
and it was singing all day long . and when it stops it means that it just died .
his intent is to be funny .
it &apos;s the only swim i &apos;m interested in .
and &#91; their &#93; kids will be saved , and their grandchildren will be saved , and this passes on .
and that &apos;s the growing fertility .
all of those things matter , but that &apos;s not why .
and so i engaged my father after dinner in long , sometimes heated conversations .
and in my 35 years of working experience , i think i was really serious four times .
if anything , they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already and to build on their own capabilities .
there &apos;s this fact that i love that i read somewhere once , that one of the things that &apos;s contributed to homo sapiens &apos; success as a species is our lack of body hair — that our hairlessness , our nakedness combined with our invention of clothing , gives us the ability to modulate our body temperature and thus be able to survive in any climate we choose .
the other thing is that maybe that fowler apple or maybe a variety of wheat that &apos;s not economical right now has disease or pest resistance or some quality that we &apos;re going to need for climate change that the others don &apos;t .
so we asked the goose to do it again , and hoped she would do somehow , a more elegant or pretty job .
typical post-conflict situation is a zoo of different actors with different priorities .
we &apos;re going to look at the mid-ocean ridge , a 40,000-mile long mountain range .
instead , i am looking forward to , at least somehow , the year of the insurance , or the year of the great harvest .
we &apos;re actually projecting in another 10 years the level of disenfranchisement will be as high as it &apos;s been since prior to the passage of the voting rights act .
and we &apos;ve just recently demonstrated this by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads , and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate .
( laughter ) one of the things i did just before 9 / 11 — august of 2001 — i took my son , dax , who was 16 at the time , and i took him to pakistan .
look here you have china over there , you have india over there , and this is what has happened .
i &apos;ll show an old video . kelly was a sculptor , and this is what she did with her semester project .
this entire process lasts around 60 minutes , but when the process is over , wells that shine are matched with the specific micrornas and analyzed in terms of how much and how fast they shine .
out of four british people , three said that they were optimistic about the future of their own families .
let me give you one example from the world of recruiting , where reputation data will make the résumé seem like an archaic relic of the past .
so there &apos;s deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success .
this certainly is an accomplishment that must never be surpassed .
so a tremendous fund of knowledge despite , again , that so many people told her not to do it , it was too expensive .
but there is another world .
for instance , there are two different types of facial surgery .
and i &apos;m not saying this to save myself , although this would be nice . i &apos;m doing it to save you , because if you do this , you will be lost . &quot; &quot; to be so afraid that you &apos;re standing in the face of a death you can &apos;t escape and that you &apos;re soiling yourself and crying , but to say in that moment , as fraser says to idris , &quot; &quot; tell my girlfriend i love her . &quot; &quot; in that moment , fraser says , &quot; i am lost already , but not you ... not you . &quot;
we know that the problem begins immediately .
now you can get much higher returns , of up to 16-to-one , if you include anti-crime benefits , if you include benefits to former preschool participants who move to some other state , but there &apos;s a good reason for focusing on these three dollars because this is salient and important to state legislators and state policy makers , and it &apos;s the states that are going to have to act .
this is the river , covered , used as a trash yard .
for you nerds , here &apos;s a little behind-the-scenes .
take a look at mathematical attainment by 15 year-olds .
they understand that their quality of life depends on a mix of solitude and solidarity .
and we had to create kind of a sauce .
successions of new species emerged , evolved and became extinct .
( music ) i &apos;d like to talk to you today a little bit about the work that my brother hays and i are doing — that &apos;s us there . that &apos;s both of us actually — specifically about a concept that we &apos;ve been developing over the last few years , this idea of location-aware music .
my talk will be about the impact of religions on the number of babies per woman .
we &apos;ve just come out , we &apos;re commercializing , this year , generation 2.0 of the marrow miner .
it &apos;s estimated that about 15 to 30 million people around the world have this disease .
there &apos;s water in between the skull and the transducer .
people didn &apos;t know what caused it until the early 1900s , when a british military man figured out that it was mosquitos .
and during one of our conversations , i witnessed an interaction that changed my life forever .
and we know from his contemporaries that leonardo was a very handsome , even beautiful man .
your doctor has to make sure that you are meaningfully and knowingly consenting to that medical procedure .
this is , it seems a bit dull you know .
( laughter ) it &apos;s a difficult theory to discount , i think you &apos;ll agree . ( laughter )
it was an amazing moment .
but now that the cold war is over , there &apos;s nearly universal consensus in the muslim world — and pretty close to the same here in the united states , if you talk to people and ask them — that in principle , there &apos;s no reason that democracy and islam cannot co-exist .
they &apos;re comical , they walk upright , and , of course , they &apos;re diligent .
( applause )
70 percent reduction in violence on this day at least .
now , what had changed ?
so i thought i &apos;d bring her with me today on stage , to have her as a witness of a remarkable journey , which humbly reminds us of the period of grace we &apos;ve had over the past 10,000 years .
imagine designing spring .
the first one being women moving into the job market , the second one being the aging world population .
( laughter ) perspective is a very powerful thing . perspectives can change . perspectives can be altered . from my perspective , we live on a fragile island of life ,
the guardian wrote , &quot; &quot; if art is about transformation , then there can be no more transformative experience .
the point that we should be worried about is , how much strangeness are we getting ?
but for too many women , that &apos;s not the case .
but so often , they only get trained once , so they &apos;re not aware of new medicines , new guidelines as they come out .
these three people in the village sat down and decided to think , &quot; how do we elongate the life of this girl of our village ? &quot;
and this time even a greater number , 83 percent of the people , voted with blank ballots .
here we go . i want to see a show of hands .
i found myself in a state of constant creation , thinking only of what &apos;s next and coming up with more ideas than ever .
some have 5,000 . many have more .
without water , the bacteria won &apos;t survive .
in fact , it became so extreme i wrote a play about it .
now if your perception is much worse than your reality , what on earth are you doing trying to change the reality ?
( laughter ) it wasn &apos;t all bad .
in fact , those 15 million cellphones are the most connections that any country , including the u.s. and china , has ever established in the history of telecommunications .
that &apos;s because unlike apple , who will sell an iphone to anyone who wants one , nike doesn &apos;t make their money by just selling $ 200 sneakers .
typically , these things are put in the ground .
western societies , and in particular the u.s. , have always favored the man of action over the &quot; &quot; man &quot; &quot; of contemplation .
so , let me now talk about the last mile problem .
now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?
i mean that &apos;s a fabulous amount of money .
it &apos;s really terrifying .
because you would quickly realize , and maybe be confused by the fact , that there are three organizations that are constantly named in the articles .
now , what you also didn &apos;t see was that — and you may have noticed in the pen beside him and , by the way , the camel &apos;s name is suki .
now , this is bernoulli &apos;s gift . this is a direct quote .
in this case , hans had put the data together he had found from all kinds of united nations websites and things .
i believe we &apos;re at a tipping point where this is now something that we can &apos;t avoid .
and what was amazing about that discovery is that it also solved the mystery of what pollinated a unique flower .
it &apos;s got all the ups and the downs of movements .
well , let &apos;s see if we can do that .
bf : there we go !
and one idea comes from lessons from chewing crabs .
so , together these two nations did something truly audacious .
now you may be thinking that 30 is actually a better time to settle down than 20 , or even 25 , and i agree with you .
the great texts of the ancient world don &apos;t survive to us in their original form .
we think back in the glacial , from the analysis we &apos;ve made in the corals , that the deep part of the southern ocean was very rich in carbon , and there was a low-density layer sitting on top .
okay , now this gives one a little pause .
now this sounds a little theoretical , but it &apos;s not so theoretical .
and this is called blind date . it &apos;s a &#91; unclear &#93; , so if you &apos;re too shy to be really at the date , you can stay at a distance with your flowers and somebody else reenacts the date for you .
when i was a kid , i experienced something so powerful , i spent the rest of my life searching for it , and in all the wrong places .
some journeyed to the moons and planets .
so the next rule of the game is also pretty simple .
now it &apos;s more a part of our web of power than ever before .
it &apos;s fantastic , isn &apos;t it ?
i had just done the long jump , and a guy who was missing two legs came up to me and says , &quot; &quot; how do you do that ? you know , we &apos;re supposed to have a planar foot , so we can &apos;t get off on the springboard . &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; well , i just did it . no one told me that . &quot; &quot; so , it &apos;s funny — i &apos;m three inches within the world record — and kept on from that point , you know , so i &apos;m signed up in the long jump — signed up ?
( laughter ) but what if it turns out that barbie &apos;s actually really lonely ? ( laughter )
and that communication , that connectivity around the world , that globalization now raises a burden .
and the other risk , of course , is when you &apos;ve been working so hard for so long , and slept so few hours over the past months , people are tired , people become fatigued , and these new risks start to creep into the response .
we don &apos;t know if it was our handling methods that went wrong and we don &apos;t know if it was just this coral on this reef , always suffering from low fertility .
the ft . worth t has been on it for 25 years .
over the course of two years , my faithful husband dylan and i each spent over 300 hours underground , hiking , crawling and wriggling around 52 sites in france , spain , portugal and sicily .
that &apos;s our value proposition in a prize .
so the images that you saw at the beginning , they are actually a flame stopped in time while it is traveling through the bottle , and you have to imagine it was flipped around 180 degrees .
a camel .
so , what i am is a historian of medicine .
but that is a huge problem .
as a teenager , i was sketching , drawing , and i wanted to be an artist .
we can plot the planarity of the surfaces , their curvature , how radial they are — all information that may not be instantly visible to you , but that we can bring out , that we can articulate , and that we can use to control the folding .
and he called this part of the course the x factor , the potential of the human will .
( laughter ) and that — ( applause ) — in the depths of a very severe economic recession , i think that there &apos;s a really important lesson there , that if you can remember your international obligations whilst you are trying to rebuild your own economy , that &apos;s really something .
and i challenge anybody in the room to make their chest go like this .
so i did something else . i figured out 100 billion clicks per day , 55 trillion links is almost the same as the number of synapses in your brain .
i suspect there are some people out there sitting , kind of asking tormented questions , almost , about , well , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait a minute , there &apos;s something wrong with mankind interfering in nature in this way .
hong kong was a small bit of china that , for most of the 20th century , operated under a very different set of rules than the rest of mainland china — rules that were copied from working market economies of the time , and administered by the british .
just yesterday , we were having our family meeting , and we had voted to work on overreacting .
bicycles have become forbidden many places .
admit even in the year we leased freedom , we didn &apos;t own it outright .
it was and still is one of the worst droughts in living memory .
and they worked absolutely very , very , very hard .
a vascular surgeon removed most of the first rib on both sides of my body .
you know , people say how half of all water well projects , a year later , are failed .
so i was crushing up these pieces of glass , which , as you can see , that &apos;s the actual frame of the house .
because i had to , at a certain point , say , &quot; &quot; what am i doing out here ?
and this is quite challenging because now you have to think about networks of robots .
now the question , is this important ?
first of all , let me get you to the end step .
like , seriously .
because somewhere along the way , sometimes a single failure convinced them that they couldn &apos;t succeed , and they believed it .
you see banks — i don &apos;t know if there are any bankers over here ; i apologize in advance — but it &apos;s the best job in the world .
top 100 companies : how many women running them ?
( laughter ) you can see how this quickly captures your imagination .
so those are cool images . but these are ones i think are really cool .
obviously , we don &apos;t want one of those . ( laughter ) there &apos;s a flip side to it . in studying stars like our sun , we &apos;ve found that they go through periods of diminishment , when their total amount of energy that &apos;s expelled from them goes down by maybe one percent .
( beatboxing ) tedyouth , make some — ( beatboxing ) ( beatboxing ends ) are you ready ?
why could he not understand this ?
voice offstage : four point five .
the security council does its business in exactly the same way today that it did x number of years ago , when i was there 10 years ago .
so i just had to look around the boat and figure out what i was going to use to fix up these oars so that i could carry on .
pm : last night we gave it a few too many turns and it tried to bash the roof out also . it &apos;s about a gram .
&quot; &quot; everyone who knew me before 9 / 11 believes i &apos;m dead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people , so sometimes i didn &apos;t wear panties , and just had a big smile and chuckled to myself . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) this next one takes a little explanation before i share it with you .
i believe in the concept of a raja yogi : be a dude before you can become an ascetic .
so the small ones are short , and the bigger ones are longer .
on a more personal note , steve said , &quot; &quot; if visicalc had been written for some other computer , you &apos;d be interviewing somebody else right now . &quot; &quot; so , visicalc was instrumental in getting personal computers on business desks .
over the next 20 years he &apos;d have 22 surgeries , including four spine operations , and hip replacement after hip replacement .
a coffee cup will show where you can find more coffee , or where you can trash the cup .
hope you get the word out to many people and they go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends , etc .
god forbid .
we feel less accountable for our actions when we interact online .
it was surrounded by three isolated tribes and thanks to the colombian government and colombian colleagues , it has now expanded .
it &apos;s a very powerful principle .
and you can actually use it for our monkeys to either interact with them , or you can train them to assume in a virtual world the first-person perspective of that avatar and use her brain activity to control the movements of the avatar &apos;s arms or legs .
and , more often than not , they die sooner .
what are the planetary boundaries within which we can safely operate ? &quot; &quot; and then backtrack innovations within that .
this is a very un-pc cover . not in new york .
y &apos;all can see that right there .
there &apos;s a hole at the anus , penis level .
dp : this .
we said , &quot; &quot; that was so great , we saved this little girl &apos;s life . &quot; &quot; we were just like , you know , ah , just full of ourselves .
and in the 12th century , a line was drawn , like a musical horizon line , to better pinpoint the pitch &apos;s location .
we need to have a meal that we can trust , live long lives .
but it slightly bores me .
so then you have to make the decision .
but — ( applause ) but 2016 ! the first !
they are instead the products of downstream imagination leading to hard work , during which mathematical reasoning may or may not prove to be relevant .
audience : yeah !
i can bolster my own identity .
without human rights , you don &apos;t have the protection granted to you to campaign .
then we put a little chip , little tag , onto the trash and then started following it .
and you see , turbo &apos;s pretty intent on his flipper patting .
( laughter ) so , i made a hydrogen generator and i made an oxygen generator , and i had the two pipes leading into a beaker and i threw a match in . ( laughter )
help me ! somebody help me ! &quot; &quot; and the next thing is paralysis .
now , it was a big risk , and it wouldn &apos;t work for every story , but we showed with the panama papers that you can write about any country from just about anywhere , and then choose your preferred battleground to defend your work .
so if you were a little tiny bug living in a flower , what would that flower look like , if the flower was this big ?
for perfect scientific certainty .
and this peaks at super bowl sunday when guys would rather be in a bar with strangers , watching a totally overdressed aaron rodgers of the green bay packers , rather than jennifer lopez totally naked in the bedroom .
and when it comes to sensory restoration , we &apos;re still very far away from being able to provide beauty .
but if these machines have been around for almost 30 years , why don &apos;t we know about them ?
they have a little refueling stop in northeastern india .
you &apos;re walking by the side of the road and you &apos;re hit by a truck , or you &apos;re trying to to jump on a moving train , you &apos;re late for work , and your pant leg gets caught .
and what i love the most about this is really when the students come up to me sometimes afterwards , all surprised and a little confused , and say , &quot; &quot; i just spent two hours in this virtual lab , and ... and i didn &apos;t check facebook . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) that &apos;s how engaging and immersive this really is for the students .
i love this because it looks so easy .
so i just figured that out earlier .
( laughter ) everybody in house loved it , and so off it goes to the author .
and that year , in kosovo , this terrible , terrible thing happened , which i saw .
and indeed , you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex , which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats .
dh : whenever you &apos;re ready there , big guy .
and this very encouraging story , i think , is partly demographic-led .
if you consider a child &apos;s eyes as a pair of biological cameras , they take one picture about every 200 milliseconds , the average time an eye movement is made .
and he finished his talk with the phrase , that , &quot; &quot; the gross national product measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile . &quot; &quot; how crazy is that ? that our measure of progress , our dominant measure of progress in society , is measuring everything except that which makes life worthwhile ?
they also affect people who want to send messages , because this is really a transformation of the ecosystem as a whole , not just a particular strategy .
and it &apos;s in the six official languages of the united nations .
at the same time , while i was interviewing the red brigades , i also discovered that their life was not ruled by politics or ideology , but actually was ruled by economics .
and so , if you think about the precision of these mirrors , the bumps on the mirror , over the entire 27 feet , amount to less than one-millionth of an inch .
he was starting to look glassy-eyed .
we cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind of a foreground for this hotel .
so we thought we &apos;d just kind of model — different amounts of uv hit different parts of the earth at different times of year , so you can actually work out those stores of nitric oxide — the nitrates , nitrites , nitrosothiols in the skin — cleave to release no .
there are various things in here : i could say we might raise more revenue , or medical innovation will make the spending even higher .
five million people have taken it .
( applause ) number seven : particle accelerator mishap .
with the same method , we can also get him to circle a person .
it empowered authorities , and , as a result , marginalized citizens .
ca : it must have been just an extraordinarily emotional day because of these questions about identity , the joy of seeing you and perhaps an emphasized sense of what they had lost .
a third explanation invokes the concept of a nonzero-sum game , and was worked out in the book &quot; &quot; nonzero &quot; &quot; by the journalist robert wright . wright points out that in certain circumstances , cooperation or non-violence can benefit both parties in an interaction , such as gains in trade when two parties trade their surpluses and both come out ahead , or when two parties lay down their arms and split the so-called peace dividend that results in them not having to fight the whole time .
and partly to usa who help to provide technical advice and investment .
now , before i go any further , yes , i know it all began with &quot; &quot; britain &apos;s got talent . &quot; &quot; but my point in discussing this is to show you — i hope i &apos;ll be able to show you how these merit-based competitions , with equal access to everyone , with the winner selected via voting by sms , are changing tribal societies .
and we bring together every summer about 100 very talented students from around the world .
and worse than that , far worse than that , my sense of self-worth was kind of evaporating .
you probably went out and bought them .
what i really want to do , is i want to use this new data to try to figure out what makes the hiv epidemic grow faster or slower .
woolenness and wetness aren &apos;t exactly two concepts that go together .
( laughter ) ka : what does it mean ?
the data is then sent on a cellular network to well-equipped hospitals hundreds of miles away for analysis .
as another example , if we look at what determines an individual &apos;s wages , and we do statistical exploration of that , what determines wages , we know that the individual &apos;s wages will depend , in part , on that individual &apos;s education , for example whether or not they have a college degree .
so think about the future — it will be here soon enough .
and that &apos;s terraforming the planet : making it more like earth , reengineering an entire planet .
the wire is ready .
so in the beginning the monkey could not perform this task at all .
if the officer is honest , you get a huge penalty of being arrested for bribery .
and this exhibition is about the work of designers that help us be more elastic , and also of designers that really work on this elasticity as an opportunity . and one last thing is that it &apos;s not only designers , but it &apos;s also scientists .
and we will think about that when we look at the wider picture of the world in 1858 .
but the time now is to move from mourning and grief to action and transformation .
now we used to think that the different shape of the lure was to attract different types of prey , but then stomach content analyses on these fish done by scientists , or more likely their graduate students , have revealed that they all eat pretty much the same thing .
and every single entry had to be listened to , experienced and then based on the musical ability — then that person could either enter or not .
that &apos;s what he said .
they didn &apos;t know what couldn &apos;t be done .
listen , we have become great protectors .
they &apos;re crowd-mapping the activities of the drug dealers .
the average american used to be more than 20 times richer than the average chinese .
the second area , in brown , is the world &apos;s pastures and rangelands , where our animals live .
so before agriculture , before the agricultural revolution , it &apos;s important to understand that human beings lived in hunter-gatherer groups that are characterized wherever they &apos;re found in the world by what anthropologists called fierce egalitarianism .
and i noticed that a lot of them seemed bored .
and it &apos;s in there that those mini-big bangs will be created , sometime in the summer this year .
all right , recently i started a public art project where i don &apos;t use my artwork anymore .
dr. atkins and i debated each other many times before he died , and we agreed that americans eat too many simple carbs , the &quot; &quot; bad carbs , &quot; &quot; and these are things like — ( laughter ) — sugar , white flour , white rice , alcohol . and you get a double whammy : you get all these calories that don ’ t fill you up because you ’ ve removed the fiber , and they get absorbed quickly so your blood sugar zooms up .
i have eternal imposter syndrome .
there &apos;s certainly no quick security fix .
voice : mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow , and everywhere that mary went , the lamb was sure to go .
well , reality is a bit more complicated than this .
which brings me back to the garden of eden .
when you want the taste that won &apos;t weigh you down , the only way to go is up .
imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks .
thank you . ( applause ) ( applause ) thanks . ( applause )
second woman : dad , mom , i grew up .
that gave an advantage ; that was an implication of the technology &apos;s rise that wasn &apos;t obvious to everybody .
and where we have this gypsum strip they can harvest this water .
we were looking at dead volcanoes in arizona .
and we found all sorts of molecules , they &apos;re called halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins , that respond to green and yellow light .
i will tell that woman that my students can talk about transcendentalism like their last name was thoreau , and just because you watched one episode of &quot; &quot; the wire &quot; &quot; doesn &apos;t mean you know anything about my kids .
i &apos;m going to play a piece of music for you .
if you &apos;re in it , india , obviously , is the place to be at the moment .
we created public health care .
he went to the equivalent of an audubon society meeting .
the bottles connect together , and you can create different shapes , different forms .
but society continues to stigmatize and criminalize living in your vehicle or on the streets .
you cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water .
is this guy dangerous or just nervous ?
there are other pleasures , but this is dominant .
it &apos;s hard not to love data like that , and many people will tell you that that means that there &apos;s a worldview that you have if you speak one of those languages .
i &apos;m not going to tell you how many times it took us to make that happen .
thank you .
freeman dyson , in a ted talk , foresaw that children will design and create new organisms just as routinely as his generation played with chemistry sets .
yet , of course , like all music , it &apos;s essentially not about anything .
long john silver is not afraid of you finishing your copy of &quot; &quot; treasure island . &quot; &quot; and so it should be with us .
but i also had noticed that it wasn &apos;t working .
now this would have been a wonderful paper .
and i want to focus on mathematics .
so the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light .
it says we don &apos;t have a right to our bodies .
you put them all together , you mix them up in a bouillabaisse , and you have consumer confidence that &apos;s basically a ticking time-bomb .
the sahara was much bigger then than it is now .
as citizens , we are ready to decide on our common destinies , because we know that the way we distribute power says a lot about how we actually value everyone , and because we know that enabling and participating in local politics is a sign that we truly care about our relations to one another , and we are ready to do this in cities around the world right now .
if he &apos;s using path integration , then it should end up in the wrong spot over here .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality .
but they don &apos;t have to . they can contribute .
the egyptian people , and many other arabs who &apos;ve revolted and are in transition , have very high expectations of the government .
so , you can go to a natural source .
and i hope that compassion will be both fun and profitable for you too .
created by these very people who live , work and play in these particular spaces , these neighborhoods are intuitively designed to make the most of their circumstances .
because i want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible .
i don &apos;t know why . you know what i &apos;m saying .
and eventually after 103 days at sea , i arrived in antigua .
i was there because a colleague of mine named katrina spade is attempting to create a system , not of cremating the dead , but composting the dead .
the first is competitive , because they &apos;re looking for mates , and the second is cooperative , because if they &apos;re all vocalizing in sync together , it makes it really difficult for predators like coyotes , foxes and owls to single out any individual for a meal .
my son still had his dad .
where do we get this spark of imagination ?
but you know what the actual facts are ?
and you may be familiar with the movie &quot; &quot; contact , &quot; &quot; which sort of popularized that .
she switches from reverse to forward and she holds onto the wheel , rather than turns it .
and that &apos;s 70 percent of the united states stock market , 70 percent of the operating system formerly known as your pension , your mortgage .
that &apos;s what i do .
this is a movement for everyone .
i know that some of you here are worth more — ( laughter ) individually than the entire economy of my country .
and i developed a certitude , a faith that convinced me that i will get safely to the other side .
but you don &apos;t leave them where you found them . okay ?
several years ago , i decided to write down my experiences and my personal journey , and i want to share some more of that story with you today to convey the inside view .
today , i am more independent , but it is still not enough .
and i find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern is completely symmetrical , and it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical , or random sky .
parts of me died early on , and that &apos;s something we can all say one way or another .
they are better at recognizing other people &apos;s fear .
they completely forget .
that &apos;s not the way to solve problems .
but when we met , barack was a community organizer .
( laughter ) what can we do to it ?
and while junkies think that it &apos;s a really bad idea to expose themselves to hiv , they think it &apos;s a much worse idea to spend the next year in jail where they &apos;ll probably end up in frankie &apos;s situation and expose themselves to hiv anyway .
first of all , does everyone have the basic needs of survival : food , water , shelter , safety ?
what i &apos;m trying to say is , i &apos;m not trying to prove which system of transport is better .
well , with experiments , what you can do is answer a simple question .
and this wasn &apos;t a pretty thing .
all right , so it &apos;s here . this y2k + 10 problem is at our door .
and some people get 100 percent discount , and some people get 20 percent discounts , and some people get 50 percent discount , etc .
now we &apos;ve never seen a shadow like this of a black hole , but black holes can be heard , even if they &apos;re not seen .
but it works pretty well .
you see , yeah , perfect .
( laughter ) at the end of the course , the students got a certificate .
and in a bacterium , the crispr system allows that dna to be plucked out of the virus , and inserted in little bits into the chromosome — the dna of the bacterium .
( laughter ) or so we thought , until a woman came rushing across the campus and dropped her bag on the floor , pointed up to the sign and said , &quot; who &apos;s falafel ? &quot; ( laughter )
should i be pro-technology ? should i embrace it full arms ?
the goal of this project , which we called the hive , was to prototype the experience of humans , computers and robots all working together to solve a highly complex design problem .
case in point , einstein .
they don &apos;t draw to sell the work to a client or play the piano to earn money for the family .
but why has it taken so long ?
thank you .
do we take that william blake is somehow more of a human than gertrude stein ?
it &apos;s actually very hot .
but you can always talk to their dog or their baby .
these are chemical clocks , and they &apos;re found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell .
i &apos;m assuming there are not many people here who speak icelandic .
we mark it with a gps fix , and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen , so we could essentially put it back on the surface , exactly where we found it .
it was our mindset , because we are not behaving as a media outlet .
so if someone says , &quot; &quot; oh , i see the portrait , &quot; &quot; it may not be the portrait after a few months .
i guess so . because in a way , if a tedster relates to all the interconnectedness of all the computers and everything , it &apos;s the forging of a mass awareness , of where everybody can really know everything that &apos;s going on everywhere in the planet .
and one of my friends , now , he has a family of eight , and he supports his whole family with a blog that he writes for twice a week .
thank you very much . i appreciate that .
the high point of the public theater , i think , was in 1996 , two years after i designed it , which was the &quot; &quot; bring in &apos; da noise , bring in &apos; da funk &quot; &quot; campaign that was all over new york .
kb : neither , oh , ok .
so , here we got the white area in the middle , and you can pick it up .
( laughter ) th : exactly . so why does this stand out ?
one of the things i &apos;m most happy about is that the spaceshipone is going to hang in air and space museum , next to the spirit of st. louis and the wright flyer .
and it doesn &apos;t really matter — i don &apos;t want you understand why it doesn &apos;t have the if statement , but i want you to understand that sometimes you can see a problem in a different way and rewrite it so that a special case goes away and becomes the normal case .
imagine a world and basically everybody was 20 to 30 years old .
now , it turns out that there &apos;s something fundamental about antibiotics which makes it different from other drugs , which is that if i misuse antibiotics or i use antibiotics , not only am i affected but others are affected as well , in the same way as if i choose to drive to work or take a plane to go somewhere , that the costs i impose on others through global climate change go everywhere , and i don &apos;t necessarily take these costs into consideration .
it seems to me that there is this latent potential everywhere , all around us .
many of these buildings are incredibly beautiful , and also much more effective .
all the branches of the trees , the leaves that come down create a humid area , and they take months and months under the water , go to the rivers , and maintain our source , maintain our rivers .
because what people want is what politicians try , they don &apos;t always succeed , but they try and deliver .
they have shown an exemplary bravery in confronting the brutal dictatorship of gaddafi .
but today , i &apos;m going to pick three i find interesting and share what actually it reminds me about launching new products and services .
we don &apos;t know why some cells want to do one repair pathway and some cells would rather do the other .
and this has already saved millions of lives , and it has prevented entire economies from capsizing in sub-saharan africa .
now , this movie has floated around hollywood for well over half a century , and we first got involved with the project in the early &apos; 90s , with ron howard as the director .
so here &apos;s what you do .
this kind of trafficking , in narcotics , in humans , in weapons , god forbid , in weapons of mass destruction , is part of the threat to the global commons .
we &apos;ve managed to adapt , and have conquered the whole planet .
and when her daughter was born , she suddenly found herself confronting questions that now began to seem quite resonant to me .
of course one can make a biological argument .
steve sillett and marie antoine are the principal explorers of the redwood forest canopy . they &apos;re world-class athletes , and they also are world-class forest ecology scientists .
we need an infrastructure dynamic enough to handle these seismic shifts in our population .
and i can do that in the first year and i can balance that in the next 10 , and the next 20 years , this energy , which is necessary to condition a world cup in qatar , the next 20 years , this energy goes into the grid of qatar .
the regional branch managers are getting nervous .
so , even though sometimes it &apos;s still hard , i will share with you that it helps me to realize society is more tolerant , usually because of places like this , because of ideas like this , and people like you , with an open mind .
so let &apos;s have a look and see how this works when multiple people communicate .
and in total — we just reported this last year — we found over 200 species of biofluorescent fish .
and obviously they were , &quot; &quot; is this what you spent years doing ?
but i was convinced i was going to get him to buy a license plate protector .
basically , no one &apos;s very happy .
clearly , the internet is already having eyes and ears , you have web cams and so forth . but it &apos;s going to also have legs and hands .
i &apos;m a little bit of an amateur historian , so i &apos;ve spent some time going back , trying to see the first mention of this kind of thing . and the best , earliest quote that i could find was one from david livingstone , writing in the 1850s about how the railroad , the steam ship , and the telegraph were integrating east africa perfectly with the rest of the world .
so the cost of the climate crisis is mounting up , there are many of these aspects i haven &apos;t even mentioned .
and so you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis , it will create a disc of light that we can control .
something i never talk about in scientific meetings is how i actually got to this state and why i do the work that i do .
i came across this story about the ancient greek writer , homer .
it &apos;s a waste product .
but sometimes , we have to advocate for ourselves .
these guys came up with a kit version for 750 dollars , and that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks can get a hold of this and begin playing with 3d printers .
we all have a role in making a difference .
ca : so that would produce irrigation for the entire village ?
but the thing that i know you all have heard a lot of times , american soldiers saying , &quot; why don &apos;t they talk about the good stuff that we do ? &quot;
while i was taking care of them , we got more news about rob hall .
based on this trial , in april of this year , the fda approved tumor treating fields for the treatment of patients with recurrent gbm .
what is power ?
even in popular literature , the only book i &apos;ve ever found — and this should be on all of your reading lists — the only book i &apos;ve ever found that makes the entrepreneur into the hero is &quot; &quot; atlas shrugged . &quot; &quot; everything else in the world tends to look at entrepreneurs and say that we &apos;re bad people .
don &apos;t spit , don &apos;t do anything wrong , so that the clean water can be collected .
it &apos;s about zero-sum and non-zero-sum games .
thank you .
but more likely is this .
they were all tired of the fighting .
but it wasn &apos;t just individuals .
and so it is with archimedes , the great greek mathematician .
( laughter ) text : relpy to all .
a city could find oil or diamonds underground and it would not be so valuable as road space .
i get asked a lot what the difference between my work is and typical pentagon long-range strategic planners .
but still , maybe this is something weird about my brain and no one else has one of these things in there , so to find out , we scanned a bunch of other people and found that pretty much everyone has that little face-processing region in a similar neighborhood of the brain .
audience : yeah .
but in fact , they found something very surprising .
it &apos;s not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored , because there &apos;s nothing for the drug to bind to .
because what we realize today is that modern culture appears to have adopted a strategy of tragedy .
fifteen minutes later — next question : where is calcutta ?
when the war ended , we were released , and given a one-way ticket to anywhere in the united states .
so many emotions seem to be inside of it .
let &apos;s look at this cartoon .
then it was as if i stepped back and thought that i could have very well been one of them .
adam smith , 200 years ago , spoke about our desire for a life without shame .
because where we have a surplus of technology in the cybersecurity industry , we have a definite lack of — call me old-fashioned — human intelligence .
there &apos;s something almost quite magical about visual information .
and yet , in many places , a third of the children , by the time they &apos;re three already are facing a life of hardship due to this .
&quot; &quot; my life sucks because i live under a tyrant , also known as king george .
so our energy future is not fate , but choice , and that choice is very flexible .
why are you putting yourself at risk ?
if we could reduce the usage of paper towels , one paper towel per person per day , 571,230,000 pounds of paper not used .
( applause )
any actor in a democracy is embedded in a network of relationships .
at the point where you can weaponize your buildings , you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way .
as you can see , it has world class art , and it &apos;s all my taste because i raised all the money .
so the big difference today , wealth inequality is still very large , with 60 , 70 percent of total wealth for the top 10 , but the good news is that it &apos;s actually better than one century ago , where you had 90 percent in europe going to the top 10 .
this , in the past , is why you didn &apos;t mess with isolated indians .
this is about justice . really .
some part of me — a true living , breathing person — has become programmed , electronic and virtual .
the observation that stem cells , as master cells , could give rise to a whole variety of different cell types — heart cells , liver cells , pancreatic islet cells — captured the attention of the media and the imagination of the public .
they &apos;re feasting . &quot; &quot; feasting ? i was totally confused .
i can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles .
( laughter ) and the good news is i don &apos;t have a prepared speech , but i have a box of slides .
do it over lunch .
you may remember these guys .
and this is one that i did , probably like when i was around seventh grade , and i remember when i was doing this , i was thinking about that little rock there , and the pathway of the vehicles as they would fly through the air , and how the characters — ( laughter ) — would come shooting out of the car , so , on my mind , i was thinking about the trajectory of the vehicles .
they &apos;ve got an apple here from south africa .
now , our data processing on this is still preliminary , but it really seems that these phenomenal feats that the race car drivers are performing are instinctive .
so ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative reality .
one first saying that i &apos;m sure you all have heard is the fact that too much screen time makes your eyesight worse .
well , if we really think about it , we see that the business model of the internet today really isn &apos;t compatible with privacy .
it didn &apos;t happen accidentally .
as a starting point for discussion with the ted group , a major part of the problem is the nature of the written extent of informed consent that the patient or spouse must read and sign .
so does this kind of conversation happen in the real world , not just in these design meetings ?
you up for that ? okay .
( applause ) this baby is fully electric .
anyway , this project , or this experience , make me start a new project on the design of medicine .
and we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism .
everybody : i am my connectome .
this is why we have set up the governance school and the center for civil society here in berlin , because we believe most of our educational and research institutions in germany and continental europe in general , do not focus enough , yet , on empowering civil society and training the leadership of civil society .
energy use . organisms sip energy , because they have to work or barter for every single bit that they get .
just flash it , scare the guy . he &apos;s a punk .
but anyway , this is about the evils of science , so i think it ’ s perfect .
it &apos;s such a simple question , but these days , of course , simple questions bring ever more complicated answers .
all the time he &apos;s been doing 65 miles per hour down the freeway .
i got tired of seeing this happening .
they were calling it the &quot; &quot; billy possum . &quot; &quot; within 24 hours , the georgia billy possum company was up and running , brokering deals for these things nationwide , and the los angeles times announced , very confidently , &quot; &quot; the teddy bear has been relegated to a seat in the rear , and for four years , possibly eight , the children of the united states will play with billy possum . &quot; &quot; so from that point , there was a fit of opossum fever .
each question , there &apos;s a possible answer between zero and a hundred , and at the end of the quiz , you get an overall score between zero and a hundred .
shhhhhhhhhh .
why are they doing that ? because they expect investment to follow .
this room may appear to be holding 600 people , but there &apos;s actually so many more , because in each one of us there is a multitude of personalities .
since then , i &apos;ve played other places that are much nicer .
inclusive leadership is critical to putting people first .
and he said , &quot; &quot; she read it once and then she read it again . &quot; &quot; and she turned to him and said , &quot; is that our cat ? &quot;
now , capitalism has been responsible for every major innovation that &apos;s made this world a more inspiring and wonderful place to live in .
i think that the world trade center in , rather an unfortunate way , brought architecture into focus in a way that i don &apos;t think people had thought of in a long time , and made it a subject for common conversation .
you can spot it in the provocation of a button , an arm poking at a sleeve , a balancing act at a night-time curb while negotiating the dark .
i decided to take a sabbatical , in fact , at the new school , bruce .
now obviously , every time i bring this up , people even , you know , here at the conference , say , &quot; are you serious ? thirty stories ? how &apos;s that going to happen ? &quot;
the question is : how much would people like joshua bell , the music of joshua bell , if they didn &apos;t know they were listening to joshua bell ?
plastic just is not going to do it . &quot; &quot; we sort of worked things out .
nakilia invited reuben too , but — rockett : but what ? isn &apos;t he coming ?
we also have to have energy .
the title of the book is , &quot; &quot; what the dormouse said : how the &apos; 60s counterculture shaped the personal computer industry . &quot; &quot; the title was taken from the lyrics to a jefferson airplane song . the lyrics go , &quot; &quot; remember what the dormouse said .
is that likely , do you think , here ?
so — ( laughter ) and the feedback for the p.a. system is no help at all .
they were put into a segregated all japanese-american unit and sent to the battlefields of europe , and they threw themselves into it .

so this building actually celebrates the water as it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed so that it can be filtered for the final time .
i took this video last week . here &apos;s a paraplegic patient actually walking by strapping on these exoskeletons .
so he was using social media in private .
not to say , &quot; &quot; oh my god , what is it ? &quot; &quot; but to be challenged by it — to say , &quot; &quot; wow , this is beautiful , &quot; &quot; on one level , but on the other level , &quot; &quot; this is scary . i shouldn &apos;t be enjoying it . &quot; &quot; like a forbidden pleasure . and it &apos;s that forbidden pleasure that i think is what resonates out there , and it gets people to look at these things , and it gets people to enter it . and it also , in a way , defines kind of what i feel , too — that i &apos;m drawn to have a good life .
we have a moral obligation to invent technology so that every person on the globe has the potential to realize their true difference .
is there a way to produce algae inexpensively ?
and thank you very much .
if a company was going to donate a block of a decision scientist &apos;s time , it would actually make more sense to spread out that block of time over a long period , say for example five years .
you can see the different seasons there .
of course , this was the holy grail of our industry , and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn &apos;t help either , because i &apos;m sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store , you know — we see his face constantly .
and scientists that have studied this have said they &apos;ve never seen an accident .
( laughter ) but you get the picture . and then it goes to the inauguration .
there are , of course , the therapeutic results of this , but then there are the un-therapeutic ones and they seem to be the ones gaining traction , particularly in the media .
in a 12-month period when i was at the orphanage , only one child had been adopted .
and so now all the birds come in . and i have hawks .
do you know how hard that is to avoid when you actually work at facebook ?
you know , i like to call it &quot; &quot; the national automobile slum . &quot; &quot; you can call it suburban sprawl .
so the cambrian explosion , when all the body plans of the animals were evolved , took only 10 million years . it was 200 times faster .
and as for outsiders , white , black or brown , tar and feather them , and whip them out of town .
we kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics and that selects for resistant mutants .
we &apos;re really good at small numbers .
and then i thought i would share with you what that method is , or one of them .
now what we &apos;re seeing lots of examples of , obviously , is the opening up of government data , not enough examples of this yet , but we &apos;re starting to see this practice of people creating and generating innovative applications on top of government data .
but when you shake it , you get pakistan &apos;s perspective .
and he had to close his eyes , it &apos;s so disgusting , and the smell and everything .
&quot; use a condom , don &apos;t get aids . &quot;
but first i want to say that the intensity and persistence with which we experience these emotional components of regret is obviously going to vary depending on the specific thing that we &apos;re feeling regretful about .
in particular , i &apos;m interested in the relationship to the future financial self .
an image is worth more than a thousand words , so i &apos;m going to start my talk by stop talking and show you a few images that i recently captured .
i am passionate about the american landscape and how the physical form of the land , from the great central valley of california to the bedrock of manhattan , has really shaped our history and our character .
my mother in accra , my twin sister in boston , my best friends in new york : these relationships are home for me .
okay ? so i want you to think about that problem as we go on , and count how many symmetries there are .
so dystonia is a disorder affecting children .

we knew conservation would fail if it doesn &apos;t work to improve the lives of the local communities .
it has taken many years , but it has been very rewarding .
you needn &apos;t bring the gun into the uk anymore .
i &apos;m showing you two works , one on the right by leon golub , one on the left by robert colescott .
and i &apos;ve been studying it for a couple years .

in countless accidents , the driver says , &quot; i didn &apos;t see it coming . &quot;
it &apos;s too much energy on a planet .
so let me tell you about the u-report , which i &apos;m really excited about . it &apos;s 150,000 millennials all across uganda , young people armed with 2g phones , an sms social network exposing government corruption and demanding to know what &apos;s in the budget and how their money is being spent .
it &apos;s become the de facto battle for gay equality , and it seems like daily , laws prohibiting it are being challenged in the courts , even in places like texas and utah , which no one saw coming .
most of our countries don &apos;t even have any opinion research .
i &apos;ve discovered these people , who , in v-day world , we call vagina warriors .
trend-following would have been great in the &apos; 60s , and it was sort of ok in the &apos; 70s .
and you could tell very easily when your experiment was working and wasn &apos;t , and where it was in the phase .
i don &apos;t think it will transport 200 people in the next years .
mb : so i love the effervescence , bubbling up .
they don &apos;t own those facilities .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever felt so happy in my entire life .
i was privileged to have that kind of good start .
so , this is a six-shot sequence .
and what they &apos;re finding is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants can be highly toxic to phytoplankton , which is very bad news , because so much life depends on it .
i &apos;ll leave it at that , thank you very much .
fast forward to 2002 .
and the rules and the belief systems were wildly disparate .
three years later , we have the perimeter institute for theoretical physics in waterloo , ontario . it ’ s the most exciting job i ’ ve ever had .
and that &apos;s the kind of polishing that these mirrors have endured .
i really believe that you have to have a passion for it .
now we do daydreaming in 11 : 30 with 55 seconds left .
and that was the end of the shrinking of vacuum tubes , but it was not the end of the exponential growth of computing .
and this is the first theater project i worked on .
what you see there on the screen is a human hair superimposed on the needle that &apos;s made of silk — just to give you a sense of size .
now looking at a few cases , here &apos;s one of the first cases that we had .
so does a site like this have rules ?
this happens because typically tumors are areas where the immune system has no access , and so bacteria find these tumors and use them as a safe haven to grow and thrive .
and she said to them , &quot; &quot; vusi &apos;s here , and you &apos;re not going to take him tonight .
now , the himba live in northern namibia on the border of angola , and i &apos;d been there a few times before , and i &apos;d gone back to present this book i &apos;d made , to show them the pictures , to get into a discussion with them , to say , &quot; &quot; this is how i saw you . this is how i love you .
if they stick with the process , if they stick with it , they end up doing amazing things and they surprise themselves just how innovative they and their teams really are .
now , given both the common sense and scientific data calling the doctrine of the blank slate into question , why should it have been such an appealing notion ?
i looked it up , and he was right .
♫ not to discuss this at length , ♫ ♫ but my body image was never my strength . ♫ ♫ so frankly , i wish that you all would get dressed , ♫ ♫ i mean , you &apos;re not even really naked . ♫ ♫ and i &apos;m the one with the problem . ♫ ♫ and you tell me , don &apos;t worry so much , you &apos;ll be great . ♫ ♫ but i &apos;m the one living with me ♫ ♫ and i know how i get . ♫ ♫ your advice is gentle but late . ♫ ♫ if not just a bit patronizing . ♫ ♫ and that sarcastic tone doesn &apos;t help me when i sing . ♫
several western companies are now adopting frugal innovation to create affordable products for western consumers .
this region responds when you think about what another person is thinking .
the result : most of the deaths have been in people under 30 years of age , robustly healthy young adults .
and it &apos;s part of what tedwomen does .
and that is the same reef ; that &apos;s the same reef 15 years ago ; that &apos;s the same reef today .
he took women with metastatic breast cancer , randomly divided them into two groups .
as a matter of fact , 1964 was the year with the highest birth rate ever in germany : more than 1.3 million .
my desire to create a sensor-based technology perhaps stemmed from my lifelong love for sensors and technology .
and it &apos;s this convergence that gives us this incredible pace .
but the only way we &apos;re going to be able to write it is if we do it together .
and here , you can see one such example , where we label the fibers coming from the brain in red .
just to give you a few examples : &quot; ending a pregnancy &quot; versus &quot; killing a fetus ; &quot; &quot; a ball of cells &quot; versus &quot; an unborn child ; &quot; &quot; invading iraq &quot; versus &quot; liberating iraq ; &quot; &quot; redistributing wealth &quot; versus &quot; confiscating earnings . &quot;
and those beautiful wispy clouds are , in fact , fires , human-made fires .
it &apos;s a gambler &apos;s game even today .
you see the heart coming out there . it takes about 40 minutes to print , and about four to six hours later you see the muscle cells contract .
i photographed him at the scene of arrest in chicago .
you &apos;d stay until , at some point , the jail would be booked to capacity , and they &apos;d want to book someone new in .
but how can i tell an eight-year-old boy that his father is a politician ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) now , as a politician myself , standing in front of you , or indeed , meeting any stranger anywhere in the world , when i eventually reveal the nature of my profession , they look at me as though i &apos;m somewhere between a snake , a monkey and an iguana , and through all of this , i feel , strongly , that something is going wrong .
even the pencil .
now just don &apos;t untie me no matter what . &quot; &quot; he throws the first mate to the ground .
but we have to use its power wisely .
thank you .
and there , we sat down , and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on mt . everest .
that gets your adrenaline going .
right ? it &apos;s beans ; right ? it &apos;s coffee beans .
well , if we &apos;re going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of millennium development goals that we &apos;re set as a world , we need to learn from the innovators , and those innovators come from every single sector .
( laughter ) it &apos;s pretty scary . ( laughter )
truth be told , i have never found a role model i could truly identify with .
but of course , that was in austria at the height of romantic lyricism , not here in the suburbs of cleveland . ( laughter )
and this excites me , because this means that the energy it takes to accommodate someone with a disability can be leveraged , molded and played with as a force for creativity and innovation .
it &apos;s got two people inside it on stilts , which give them the height , and somebody in the front who &apos;s using a kind of steering wheel to move that head .
and when you label something as objective and rational , automatically , the other side , the subjective and emotional , become labeled as non-science or anti-science or threatening to science , and we just don &apos;t talk about it .
no bill ever disappeared .
there &apos;s sustaining innovation , which will sustain an existing institution or an organization , and disruptive innovation that will break it apart , create some different way of doing it .
we know we &apos;ll use electricity in 20 or 30 years &apos; time .
they give 20 minutes — that &apos;s a time warning .
but in order to find out the real secrets of these creatures &#91; it was necessary &#93; for us to actually insert a small radio transmitter inside &#91; each &#93; snake .
in this strange moment where , like , these things kind of appeared .
so this is a — i used to kind of be an actor .
so again , the really important question is what happens when we change the statistical data ever so slightly .
doctors have a saying that , in fact , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re not dead until you &apos;re warm and dead . &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s true . it &apos;s true .
it &apos;s an insult to the basic laws of nature and of biology .
so there are many reasons , and for all of these reasons , this is time and this is why we must talk .
ss : well , on your way to the olympics , a couple of memorable events happened at georgetown .
i &apos;d like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward .
this object should be ice over a silicate core .
that story perfectly captures for me the final lesson that i learned : happiness is not something we find , it &apos;s something we make .
now we &apos;ve had 50 years of warnings .
and then magd came .
for a minute , i felt like my existence as a person had been noticed , and i was worth saving .
that &apos;s why when , in california , we try to deal with all the solar we &apos;ve brought online — we now get about 10 percent of electricity from solar — when the sun goes down , and people come home from work and turn on their air conditioners and their tv sets , and every other appliance in the house , we need a lot of natural gas backup .
one of those most remarkable parts about all of this is it gives us an entirely new way to understand new information , stuff that we haven &apos;t seen before .
we branch off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
i had a scholarship .
well , one of the problems , of course , turns out to be testing .
well , you feel some chest pain or indigestion .
if you don &apos;t tell us how you did it , we won &apos;t trust you .
the moorish artists were denied the possibility to draw things with souls .

either a conscious agent is carrying out the computation , or he &apos;s got a piece of machinery that admits of a computational interpretation .
if the group doesn &apos;t take action , the other 33 groups have to decide what is going to happen to the group that doesn &apos;t comply with those great deals that we are offering them .
so what you &apos;re seeing here are a couple of machines — a pattern of locomotion .
chris anderson : so i guess what we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re going to talk about your life , and using some pictures that you shared with me .
this is one of the things they ought to be thinking more about .
and users , for all of us — we can demand technology that works this way .
buy african products .
as we think about intersecting technologies — everybody has a cell phone with a camera — we could use this everywhere , whether it be health care , patient care , engineering , law , conferencing , translating videos .
( audience : jack of spades . ) lg : jack of spades . jack of spades .
in this case , they were using a real stunt man . it was a very dangerous stunt .

the good-news stories in medicine are early detection , early intervention .
it basically directed the sounds onto a diaphragm that vibrated a needle that essentially engraved the sound on tinfoil that was wrapped around the cylinder .
it &apos;s one way of describing what happened with deregulation of the financial services in the u.s. and the u.k.

this approach is called integrated water management , or holistic or closed-loop .
but here is what &apos;s really great .
we have the power to do that .
beyond these sorts of things , a medical doctor didn &apos;t have a lot that they could do .
go to the open house and express your options .
i mean , it seems like you &apos;re still a little bit in the growth phases , you &apos;re still doing these incredible new plans .
they even applaud it .
and as i pause for a few seconds , have a look at the screen .
and i &apos;m just going to read one of them to you .
would you like kim jong-il , who &apos;s killed about two million people , would you like him gone ?
essentially , here you have all the bling-bling of the world &apos;s museums organized for you .
and no tv , no radio , no newspaper , no one to talk to .
you get health insurance ? dental ?
imagine you are in a maternity ward in mali , and have a newborn in need of urgent medication .
they needed fewer hospitalizations .
and nature builds large skeletons out of it .
so we can actually use biomaterials now .
( music ) and just like that , the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality .
spect imaging is a brain-scanning technology that uses a radioactive tracer to track blood flow in the brain .
however , still , as you can see , it has a cord , umbilical cord . so , we &apos;re still using an external power source and external computation .
there &apos;s not one that we know of . &quot; &quot; so they &apos;re doing that , and we &apos;re going to launch it later this year , and it &apos;s all an experiment , and it &apos;s all voluntary .
so this is very conscious knowledge .
what force is driving all galaxies to rush away from every other at an ever-quickening speed ?
and the truth is i don &apos;t really understand a lot of what they &apos;re talking about .
where &apos;s art ? i got productivity . i got sports .
when i reach the summit of a steep mountain in the middle of nowhere , i feel young , invincible , eternal .
all of these thousands of loosely connected little pieces are coming together , and it &apos;s about time we ask the question , how do we want to evolve human beings over the next century or two ?
mt : which means magic is theater and every trick is a story .
i tried to think , &quot; &quot; how do i respond to that hopelessness ?
four years ago , i showed you this picture .
we need to be able to measure progression objectively , and ultimately , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure .
you can &apos;t do that with head-tail-tail .
why has it accelerated lately ?
we need lots more .
until quite recently , we simply didn &apos;t know how many brazilians were killed by guns .
my wife started to fine me one dollar for every irrelevant fact i inserted into conversation .
this is a challenge that we share with thousands of other researchers around the world .
it was , like , this is my time for shine .
if you ask men why they did a good job , they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m awesome .
it takes what we know , and it twists it .
my foot goes down its throat . it spits me out .
we live on a planet .
the lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles — a car approaching from the front , the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads , any obstacles around the vehicle .
also the visual separation .
a remarkable idea , and yet evidence is growing almost weekly , with new papers coming out , confirming that this does indeed take place .
and even though the color was pretty hideous , i did love the car , and it really cemented my love affair with cars that &apos;s continued on to this day .
parents pool their money to hire some local teachers to a private , tiny , unofficial school .

ca : can we see that ? em : yeah .
muzetta &apos;s family give the lie to this .
we &apos;ve driven well over 100,000 miles now totally automated .
now this is not a problem of resources ; this is a problem of incentives .
so when i virtually touch data , it will generate forces in the pen , so i get a feedback .
let &apos;s start with the hobbies . when you get dementia , it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself .
and into that ferment came the microprocessor .
i mean i &apos;ve rarely seen lines so flat .
this is a chicken with teeth .
&quot; that misses the point . &quot;
we evolved essentially from an african stock .
right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year that i &apos;ll talk a little bit about .
and i think that can be some really good news .
it &apos;s my response , my attitude , to oppression that i &apos;ve got control over , and that i can do something about .
well , the kids loved the food .
staying is the new shame .
what we see is a unique , personal , virtual reality that is masterfully constructed by our brain .
if the rules for the universe are simple , it &apos;s kind of inevitable that they have to be very abstract and very low level ; operating , for example , far below the level of space or time , which makes it hard to represent things .
ok , so the question is : do we see this in the sky ?
somebody told me today there was this thing called folders , but i don &apos;t know what they are .
but unless we start testing those intuitions , we &apos;re not going to do better .
that &apos;s getting closer .
i couldn &apos;t make it , &quot; &quot; everyone held her breath , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; everyone held his breath , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; everyone held his or her breath . &quot; &quot; whatever i suggested had to blend in .
in fact , i went to nashville .
as a result , déclassé consumption is in .
how can such a thing exist as part of the real world ? &quot; &quot; and this , if you &apos;ve ever had a philosophy course , this is known as the famous mind-body problem .
i haven &apos;t been shot at in six years , and i was woken up very abruptly this morning by a nightmare that i was being strafed by aircraft , six years later .
and in fact , even in that very first event , ligo found things that we didn &apos;t expect .
i mean , most of us know that pitch is a fundamental building block of music .
and you just saw motts the research engineer , there , going into the mri system , and he was wearing goggles .
several years ago , we started thinking about it .
people began to buy their own postcards and make their own postcards .
their treatment is a reflection of the values held beyond prison walls .
she &apos;s being filmed with a hidden camera .
that &apos;s why we all live in developer houses .
this is a very small grain of sand , this whole thing .
it &apos;s great stuff .
he asked the pga , the professional golfers &apos; association , for permission to use a golf cart in the pga tournaments .
so when nicolaus copernicus said , actually the earth is not the center of the universe , the sun is the center of the solar system , the earth moves around the sun .
he quoted the words of all kinds of people who &apos;d had a variety of these experiences .
but really , it wasn ’ t the drugs that were important ; it was this idea that what the drugs did would help shock people out of their normal way of thinking , and getting them to forget the adult behaviors that were getting in the way of their ideas .
what you &apos;re seeing here is , we &apos;ve selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient .
and this is great because , you know , for a quarter , you can play this for a long time . ( laughter )
you can hold it like a liver , but it has no cells ; it &apos;s just a skeleton of the liver .
for every one single neuron , you can actually have from 10,000 to 100,000 different connections or dendrites or whatever you want to call it , and every time you learn something , or you have an experience , that bush grows , you know , that bush of information .
so by the time i &apos;m finished talking here , there &apos;ll be 864 more hours of video on youtube than there were when i started , and two and a half million more photos on facebook and instagram than when i started .
using acoustic emission , you know , this little noise that you hear a structure emit , sing to you when they are stressed , and reveal the damage going on , there &apos;s a collective phenomenon of positive feedback , the more damage gives the more damage , so you can actually predict , within , of course , a probability band , when the rupture will occur .
so let &apos;s move to chapter two : the oil era .
now , you need a laptop .
so we did .
in our fears , the characters are us .
the 20th century , the last hundred years , is riddled with disastrous examples of times that one school or the other tried to explain the past or predict the future and just did an awful , awful job , so the economics profession has acquired some degree of modesty .
if i &apos;m going to use the word &quot; &quot; wednesday &quot; &quot; in a sentence , and i &apos;m coming up to the word , and i can feel that i &apos;m going to stutter or something , i can change the word to &quot; &quot; tomorrow , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; the day after tuesday , &quot; &quot; or something else .
the first is electric autonomous flying vehicles .
when will it catch up ? i have to go back to very conventional graph .
so this is what russian looks like in a visual abstraction .
so thank goodness , they can &apos;t be used to engineer viruses or bacteria .
we can &apos;t afford the fanciest places to stay at night , so we tend to sleep a lot outdoors .
the schizophrenic mind is not split , but shattered .
sexual reproduction enters the picture .
15 years later , 14 or 15 years later , follow-up study .
and what we found was very , very interesting .
i had to practice it as a kid , and i &apos;m really sick of it . so — ( laughter ) i would , so what i might like to try to do is to change it , to transform it in some ways , to personalize it , so i might take the opening , like this idea — ( music ) and then i might substitute — ( music ) and then i might improvise on that melody that goes forward from there — ( music ) ( music ) so that might be the kind of thing — why thank you .
so now what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to vary the order in which these decisions appear .
and also , again , it can — also , it &apos;s something that you — it is not something that is radiating outside .
together , we looked at a variety of biological systems , ranging from natural tropical rainforests through to managed forests and fisheries .
simply documenting these soon-to-be-demolished structures wasn &apos;t enough for me .
while browsing facebook , i saw a photo , a terrifying photo , of a tortured , dead body of a young egyptian guy .
and some people get rich enough , and if they have their ideals — in a sort of domestic sense , they get to acquire their perfect world .
if you look at some of these other items — concussions .
we need to build a log cabin , if you will , at the bottom of the sea .
you might enjoy the awkwardly tight , cut-off pajama bottoms with balloons .
we actually have a very interesting payload on there .
thank you .
and , in a way , i wanted the human figure in the picture to become a part of that nature .
thank you .
no , i &apos;m not even from jamaica . that &apos;s how they market me .
and he managed to track down , whitehead did , many of the cases of people who had drunk water from the pump , or who hadn &apos;t drunk water from the pump .
down the coast here in california , the redwood forest grows to 40 stories tall .
this is a figure from a textbook on underwater sound .
because if you happen to find this one inside your body , you &apos;re in big trouble , because that &apos;s the source code for ebola .
and this isn &apos;t just found in packaging .
now looking at these images , it &apos;s difficult to grasp the scale of this operation , which can already be seen from space and could grow to an area the size of england .
some of you might already know him .
so we really had to think about new , creative ways to flavor , new ways to cook and to change texture — and that was the main issue with this challenge .
even though this wasn &apos;t the direction we went because the crank — it really is stupid to have it on board , by the way .
and that &apos;s to take all the co2 , after you &apos;ve burned it , going out the flue , pressurize it , create a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it stays there .
people want to customize their lives .
so , what technology brought , through the very simple tools like these stone tools here — even something as small as this — the early bands of humans were actually able to eliminate to extinction about 250 megafauna animals in north america when they first arrived 10,000 years ago .
here &apos;s one possibility : basically , countries represent power .
i was a young man who believed that jihad is to be understood in the language of force and violence .
she bought a bright red karmann ghia with the money she made working at burger king .

( video ) abe davis : three , two , one , go .
i &apos;m supposed to scare you , because it &apos;s about fear , right ?
we &apos;ve taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit so that we &apos;ve made antagonists of the interspecies communication system .
it was 25 minutes of absolute terror that thousands of people across the u.s. felt .
but you know , there is progress being made in places like cambodia and thailand .
and we try to do this for as long as possible .
and it was the same — learning by rote — from primary school through graduate school .
i was so determined to survive that i used my scarf to tie tourniquets around the tops of my legs , and i just shut everything and everyone out , to focus , to listen to myself , to be guided by instinct alone .
but what i &apos;ve learned through speaking with people and writing about these ideas on my website , is that there are some tremendous strengths to being this way .
suddenly , the two common threats that had pushed them closer together throughout decades , more or less evaporated .
is it like gravity , which is the same everywhere in the universe , or there would be all kinds of different biochemistries wherever we find them ?
that &apos;s nice .
and let me give you two examples .
his idea of jihad was a global war of terror , primarily targeted at the far enemy , at the crusaders from the west , against america .
and so what happened — and i think there will probably be some people in the audience that will identify with this — i went to my first meeting , first at the u.n. , and that &apos;s when this all started , because that is a very male organization .
( applause ) bg : thank you . mg : thank you very much .
such hidden biases and black-box algorithms that researchers uncover sometimes but sometimes we don &apos;t know , can have life-altering consequences .
&quot; &quot; let her go , let her go , god bless her wherever she may be she can search this whole wide world all over but she &apos;ll never find another man like me she can search this whole wide world all over and she &apos;ll never find another man like me when i die , please god , bury me in my ten-dollar stetson hat put a twenty-dollar gold piece on my watch chain so my friends know i died standing pat get six gamblers to carry my coffin and six choir girls to sing me a song stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon to raise hell as i go along
it &apos;s small and large . this is an ashtray , a water glass .
there &apos;s two spheres and they &apos;re separated in distance .
this is in the mandara mountains , near the nigerian border in cameroon , mokoulek .
imagine that you &apos;ve been raped and you &apos;re bringing up a boy child .
a third interview was conducted with someone about the north pole .
that &apos;s not going to be changed at all .
thank you very much .
i couldn &apos;t go out and play basketball at recess without feeling like i was going to pass out when i got back inside .
so even though when the powder was poison , the friend drank the coffee and died , people say grace deserves less blame in that case , when she innocently thought it was sugar , than in the other case , where she thought it was poison and no harm occurred .
so netra and i really wanted to use our 200-year plan to curate this digital legacy , and not only digital legacy but we believe in curating the legacy of my past and future .
but i think there &apos;s something really poetic about using nuclear power to propel us to the stars , because the stars are giant fusion reactors .
this is what is killing productivity , what makes people suffer at work .
i challenge each and every one of you to mentor someone different .
now , we &apos;ve gotten to a point where today , the machine understands complex events like down screens and wide pins .
it looks like a car wash . you come into your car wash .
if they &apos;re real boxes , there &apos;s not much we can do , but in a game we can just say , &quot; &quot; right , well .
in infrastructure , let &apos;s just take one example .
it doesn &apos;t need light .
that is all aid can be .
i made a hole in the boundary wall of the slum next to my office , and stuck a computer inside it just to see what would happen if i gave a computer to children who never would have one , didn &apos;t know any english , didn &apos;t know what the internet was .
you need also state ownership , especially of land assets , in order to build and roll out infrastructures very quickly .
that change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift , not only in the fortunes of monterey bay , but other places around the world .
and every single part of this mechanism is actually plausible in biology .
and so you too can type in any word or phrase that you &apos;re interested in and see its n-gram immediately — also browse examples of all the various books in which your n-gram appears .
and seeing what happens , it was ok to generalize , and say , i &apos;m sure that this will happen anytime we make one of these things .
as well as triggering severe loss of memory and mental abilities , the damage to the brain caused by alzheimer &apos;s significantly reduces life expectancy and is always fatal .
there is an invisible beauty all around us , each grain with a story to tell ...
thank you very much .
the rain and the wind will take them off anyway .
and it hasn &apos;t been published , so it &apos;s totally privy information just for ted .
a neuron under the microscope is very elegant with little things sticking out and little things over here , but when you start to put them together in a complex system , and you start to see that it becomes a brain , and that brain can create intelligence , what we &apos;re talking about in the body , and cancer is starting to model it like a complex system .
he &apos;s thinking about what he &apos;s got to do to save himself .
( applause ) trans people and trans issues , they &apos;ve been getting a lot of mainstream media attention lately .
here &apos;s sort of the end of that 10 years of work .
thank you . ( applause ) thanks very much . ( applause )
it &apos;s not a matter of teaching it ; in fact , most of the schools tend to discount intuition as an ingredient of your working process because they can &apos;t quantify it : it &apos;s very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design , but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card or a newsletter .
post-white house , he opened an investment firm called generation , where he baked environmental sustainability and other things right into the core investment process .
but anyway , off to the world of ice .
i knew that i might get hacked for giving this talk , so let me save you the effort .
well , somebody had a great idea .
and all the eastern religions except japan had the same level .
guess how much it costs to call rwanda , ghana , nigeria ?
these are going at a relative speed of two meters per second , and this illustrates the basic principle .
the car begins to slide out , dramatic maneuver to correct it , and no change whatsoever in the mental workload .
is our government that generous ? and maybe they are .
now science may dismiss this methodology , but polynesian navigators use it today because it provides them an accurate determination of the angle and direction of their vessel .
but before we get there , we &apos;re engaged in a struggle between good and evil , the good of socialism against the evil of capitalism , and the good shall triumph .
what you &apos;re looking at over here is actually the first unit that i know of of non-human currency .
the best available answer is that they were literally the earliest known works of art , practical tools transformed into captivating aesthetic objects , contemplated both for their elegant shape and their virtuoso craftsmanship .
china also believes that it is being contained by u.s. allies and by those with strategic partnerships with the u.s.
&quot; &quot; because you don &apos;t love us , norman , clearly you &apos;ve chosen your path . &quot; &quot; twenty-four hours later , my social worker , this strange man who used to visit me every couple of months , he &apos;s waiting for me in the car as i say goodbye to my parents .
and just like that , you &apos;ve been seduced into a different way of looking at something because the endorphins have brought down your defenses .
the poor puppy jumps up , you open the dog book , what does it say ?
and actually , they &apos;re very quickly becoming a reality .
anyone who saves a life , saves the life of all humanity .
but they probably don &apos;t think of these opinions as expertise .
no , the fact is , america really is crazy when it comes to drugs .
this may not seem to impress , but technological evolution is progressive , so another 10 , 20,000 years , and armaments technology takes you here .
and we have a school . this is our bright — we opened &#91; in the &#93; last two years &#91; an &#93; elementary school where we have 850 children , and the majority are women and girls .
( laughter ) thank you very much .
and i was always secretly hoping in some part of me that what was being said to me and about me wasn &apos;t ...
every individual starts pushing in one direction and this is what happens .
the connection i have with engineering is the same as any other engineer , in that i love to solve problems .
for example , how a nightlight works , or why an elevator door stays open , or how an ipod responds to touch .
and a good example of this is the rio tinto , which is in portugal .
and the reason this picture &apos;s in here is i did this slide show a couple years ago at a big economics summit , and there was a fellow in the audience who came up to me .
since the age of five , i started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence .
punishment and examinations are seen as threats .
we are so used to doing monologues .
they took pictures of me spread on the police car , and they laughed .
i said , &quot; &quot; and second of all , bad things happen to children every day , and if you didn &apos;t want these retinas , they would probably be buried in the ground right now .
and it &apos;ll be another six billion before that happens , and any remaining life on earth is vaporized .
though , i do know what this means — i think you do too .
so here &apos;s the question : can we grow axons and neurons down these channels ?
basically what it told me was — ( laughter ) ( applause ) — the kinds of countries we prefer are good countries .
the comparisons we make when we are appraising value , where we &apos;re trying to estimate how much we &apos;ll like things , are not the same comparisons we &apos;ll be making when we consume them .
did you know that 68 percent of americans now carry a library card ?
he was making , on average a week , $ 150,000 — tax free of course .
so we got some shows off the ground . we started touring them internationally .
thank you .
we can weave them , knit them , or we can make them like you see here .
the first thing that i learned is when you &apos;re holding your breath , you should never move at all ; that wastes energy .
they know , as someone once said , &quot; character &apos;s who you are in the dark . &quot;
and when the land-based ice of the arctic melts , it raises sea level .
because when you go higher , the atmosphere is getting thinner , it &apos;s getting more unstable , the temperature is getting cooler , and you have a lot more u.v. radiation .
and he is one amazing example of what i have experienced all over africa .
so what is a story ?
and in experimental feedings to rodents and ferrets , we found that the animals exhibit symptoms never seen with flu : seizures , central nervous system disorders , partial paralysis .
and , you know , if you think about this with the tsunami , what you have is essentially a kind of an army of local journalists , who are producing enormous amounts of material for no reason other than to tell their stories .
this was really the bastion of the french enlightenment , and this gorgeous illustration was featured as a table of contents for the encyclopedia .
i &apos;m optimistic , because the new machine age is digital , exponential and combinatorial .
but it &apos;s a famous picture , not because of the beauty and majesty of saturn &apos;s rings , but actually because of a tiny , faint blob just hanging underneath one of the rings .
i was ready to tell him , &quot; &quot; listen , if someone such-and-such comes tomorrow , please tell him that it was a mistake .
something i truly believe .
( applause ) and why only computers ? we can just play with papers .
but 60 years of research has demonstrated that separating children from their families and placing them in large institutions seriously harms their health and development , and this is particularly true for young babies .
and i &apos;ve been very supportive until this picture shows up on my facebook page . ( laughter ) and i actually untagged myself first , then i picked up the phone . i said , &quot; &quot; mom , you will never put a picture of me in a bikini ever again . &quot; &quot; and she said , &quot; &quot; why ? you look so cute , darling . &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; you just don &apos;t understand . &quot;
are there any monkeys here ?
he believed that the crystal was the model for all kinds of representation .
he proclaimed his innocence , his family screamed at the jury , his fiancée collapsed on the floor sobbing , and titus is taken away to jail .
but something interesting happened .
most of that money is parked in bank deposits that give you zero percent interest rate .
so , one of these examples would of course be the historic city of venice .
they &apos;re connecting partly , and perhaps even mainly , because they all belong to one body and one brain .
they give rise to the trees , they create the debris fields that feed the mycelium .
you want people to use clean needles — and junkies want to use clean needles .
the teacher &apos;s role is entirely obsolete .
now we have sprawling residential suburbias that are well distinct from production areas and commercial areas .
dad talked a lot about bad design when we were growing up , you know , &quot; &quot; bad design is just people not thinking , john , &quot; &quot; he would say whenever a kid would be injured by a rotary lawn mower or , say , a typewriter ribbon would get tangled or an eggbeater would get jammed in the kitchen .
and if you just go back to the previous image , and you look at this area of volatility and hostility , that a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture could have the affect of bringing all those warring factions together in a united cause , in terms of something that would be genuinely green and productive in the widest sense .
the brain will do more of whatever got that reward .
because ed , like vineet , understands that our role as leaders is to set the stage , not perform on it .
what do we have to get to to achieve the global goals ?
so , these gloves are a little bit small on me , but here it is .
the first is that social connections are really good for us , and that loneliness kills .
astrolabes have an incredible history .
it &apos;s a special kind of material that , when you add water , it will swell up enormously , maybe a thousand times in volume .
learning to play piano for the first time and playing four hands with a friend , or performing a ridiculous skit with friends looking like idiots — things like that .
and so in that sense , i &apos;m much more optimistic about what humans can do .
how is that going to make you feel and what decision might you make next time ?
look at the nuclei . the nuclei in the cell on the left is in the animal , the one on the right is in a dish .
and so the researchers asked themselves , &quot; &quot; i wonder how many times very secure , important , sensitive conversations are happening on these two-way radios where they forget to encrypt and they don &apos;t notice that they didn &apos;t encrypt ? &quot; &quot; so they bought a scanner . these are perfectly legal and they run at the frequency of the p25 , and what they did is they hopped around frequencies and they wrote software to listen in .
so as a result , i decided to open up a private practice , and i became the first foreigner to litigate in afghan courts .
if you want to give some of your own money to punish people who aren &apos;t contributing , you can do that . &quot; &quot; and as soon as people heard about the punishment issue going on , cooperation shoots up .
it also changed our lives in many unexpected ways , and those unexpected ways we later reflected on , that eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us , and a year later , we launched babble , a website for parents .
it &apos;s basically a nuclear-heated torpedo .
one of my mentors in life was norman borlaug , my hero .
this person has never been born .
and the way in which you could think about us as a species and us as a planet had just changed so much , and it was incredibly exciting .
&quot; &quot; what does it matter ? &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; a bullet doesn &apos;t distinguish between a muslim and a christian . &quot; &quot; this small group of women , determined to bring an end to the war , and they chose to use their traditions to make a point : liberian women usually wear lots of jewelry and colorful clothing .
because although she lived across the street they came from different worlds .
you were appointed a social worker .
so we tried to come up with a program — how we could remake this structure to better accommodate ted .
this was a group of eminent economists apologizing to the queen of england when she asked the question , &quot; &quot; why did no one tell us that the crisis was coming ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) i &apos;ll never get my knighthood . i &apos;ll never get my knighthood . ( laughter ) that &apos;s not the important point . the thing you have to remember is , these are eminent economists , some of the smartest people on the planet . do you see the challenge ? ( laughter ) it &apos;s scary . my friend and mentor , tim brown of ideo , he explains that design must get big , and he &apos;s right .
so if you really care about strengthening families , you might want to talk to some liberal groups who are working on promoting educational equality , who are working on raising the minimum wage , who are working on finding ways to stop so many men from being sucked into the criminal justice system and taken out of the marriage market for their whole lives .
it &apos;s really taken off the ground .
( laughter ) sm : i actually did not want to answer this on the ted stage .
so that was the second project .
really the sahara forest project is a model for how we could create zero-carbon food , abundant renewable energy in some of the most water-stressed parts of the planet as well as reversing desertification in certain areas .
and the second thing , i think , is that the world needs to have people in charge of that .
we have created more wealth in the past decade than ever , but for a majority of americans , their income has fallen .
i grew up diagnosed as phobically shy , and , like at least 20 other people in a room of this size , i was a stutterer .
so basically , metabolism , which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next , has side effects .
i have some news for us creatives .
ss : a year . and why don &apos;t you tell them what happened right before you go run your race ?
it &apos;s easy to not see the forest through the trees .
with this simple tweak , the dance moves from being a dictation to a negotiation .
mrs. lois doery , whom i later came to call my surrogate mum , read me many thousands of hours onto tape .
what &apos;s unexpected about this is that it &apos;s soft , but it &apos;s also a strong magnet .
at no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler . no point .
it turns out the stratosphere has winds that are going in quite different speeds and directions in thin strata .
i can feel your noise .
you start to realize that &quot; &quot; hey , i could go to this live music event and have an utterly transforming experience that will cover my entire body with goosebumps , but it &apos;s more likely that i &apos;ll feel claustrophobic and i won &apos;t be able to get a beer .
here &apos;s their jam aisle .
christopher soghoian : so , it would be funny if it wasn &apos;t true , but , in fact , hacking team &apos;s software is being sold to governments around the world .
the chef had overcooked it .
thank you .
i &apos;ve been doing that for about 10 years .
we kind of see ourselves separate , but we &apos;re very much a part of it .
i really don &apos;t want to just say &quot; &quot; i &apos;m great , &quot; &quot; because that kind of sounds narcissistic , and then i won &apos;t have any friends .
he was about age five .
it &apos;s this crazy idea , that what seems like proof of the camel &apos;s quintessential desert nature could actually be proof of its high arctic past .
or if you take an american reference , to the u.s. capitol building and you pack 3,000 capitol buildings into that block , it would be equivalent to how large that block was .
the vast majority of interactions i see — and i see a lot , believe me — are positive , people reaching out to help or to connect or share information with each other .
but innovation isn &apos;t always incremental .
so he uses a lead that focuses on his shoulder girdle and his arm .
paralysis was an opening for him .
and as i mentioned a moment ago , the core of the capitalist system has been defined by private actors .
it was quite popularly attended .
non-mammalian animals couldn &apos;t do any of those things .
and this is the situation you see .
and we all know that &apos;s from eating too much and not exercising enough , right ?
this star is called kepler-186f .
and besides that , there &apos;s the whole problem of getting the system into the cell in the first place .
why is is this important ?
what do i get there ? &quot; &quot; we get a visual pattern of what these nine-year-olds called acceleration .
so people , for instance , just to gross you out for a second , had cesspools of human waste in their basement . like , a foot to two feet deep .
( applause ) thank you . thank you . ( applause ) thank you .
and peggy phelan reminded me that maybe my brains could be more important than my boobs .
so , here &apos;s the shot .
they have often been rejected by their families , have had bad experiences with medical care and they come to you fully prepared for you to join the long list of people who &apos;s about to disappoint them .
what does that translate to in terms of numbers of films , really ?
and what &apos;s taking place is that the beetle has got a home spot , it goes out on a convoluted path looking for food , and then when it finds food , it heads straight home . it knows exactly where its home is .
we push the pendulum back into the other direction .
what i &apos;m saying is that this is simply the best way to mitigate risk in a foraging context .
and you can not react to injustice , only to forget about it the next day , just because the rest of twitter has moved on .
and i had the usual kind that i think a lot of people had , and that is that , you know , i had expectations placed on me .
but even now , 2011 , there &apos;s still certain cells that we just can &apos;t grow from the patient .
now the brain may not look like much from the outside — a couple pounds of pinkish-gray flesh , amorphous — but the last hundred years of neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain , and to see the intricacy of what lies within .
and i could never really understand exactly what it was , or how it was informing me .
the same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves , but induce immunity against other viruses .
we have no uniform policies regarding quarantine across the united states .
i think that this will result in my surgeries with a better outcome and fewer complications . &quot; &quot; what needs to happen now is further development of our technology along with development of the instrumentation that allows us to see this sort of fluorescence in the operating room .
brad pitt : what if i told you that i wasn &apos;t getting older ...
so imagine if cloe had access to this real-time emotion stream , and she could share it with anybody she wanted to .
and here we are .
so , within six months europe became the epicenter of the money-laundering activities of the world .
namely , the extent to which you have one of these biased time perspectives .
we thought that was a good time to announce it .
there is a basic view that real value involves making things , involves labor . it involves engineering .
the reality is that covering britney is cheaper .
so had the graduate heard the right one word , maybe he would have ended up onstage — oh , i don &apos;t know — maybe with these two .
so , the history of east asia in fact , people don &apos;t think about nations and borders .
as we sail into an uncertain future , we need every form of human intelligence on the planet working together to tackle the challenges that we face as a society .
you already saw the work by tony atala on ted , but this ability to start filling things like inkjet cartridges with cells are allowing us to print skin , organs and a whole series of other body parts .
opens it up and there &apos;s a pearl necklace inside .
now , if i had to draw together all these different experiments in task shifting , and there have of course been many other examples , and try and identify what are the key lessons we can learn that makes for a successful task shifting operation , i have coined this particular acronym , sundar .
that &apos;s the inter-monsoon , the time when the monsoon changes .
and astronomers said , if the earth is moving and we look at a prominent star , let &apos;s say , sirius — well i know i &apos;m in manhattan so you guys can &apos;t see the stars , but imagine you &apos;re out in the country , imagine you chose that rural life — and we look at a star in december , we see that star against the backdrop of distant stars .
that &apos;s why i call for the &quot; &quot; chief detail officer . &quot; &quot; every corporation should have one , and every government should have a ministry of detail .
and he tells us to pay , but we don &apos;t speak english .
and that &apos;s the whole piece .
we &apos;ve started the first malaria treatment programs they &apos;ve ever had there .
dl : she saw fish , dolphins , whales , sharks , and even some sea turtles .
we say it becomes more strongly stratified .
the exciting news is that &apos;s starting to happen .
i became one of the working homeless .
and to build a human , you need three billion of them .
and we saw this guy , haibao .
you can keep sitting here with us .
and here &apos;s this incredibly simple molecule , a nitrogen and an oxygen that are stuck together , and yet these are hugely important for &#91; unclear &#93; our low blood pressure , for neurotransmission , for many , many things , but particularly cardiovascular health .
it &apos;s a story about lemonade .
it &apos;s called bot or not , and you can go and play it for yourselves .
so thanks to these amazing devices , we have been able to gather precious information about tapir reproduction and social organization which are very important pieces of the puzzle when you &apos;re trying to develop those conservation strategies .
and i got three voicemails .
sadly , a temporary weight gain can become permanent .
now , these people making these proclamations to me were not bad people .
( laughter ) and ghosn came up and said , &quot; i have the car , mr. peres ; i will build you the cars . &quot;
we &apos;ve worked on small schools , we &apos;ve funded scholarships , we &apos;ve done things in libraries .
kanzi and panbanisha are stimulated by this fun-filled environment , which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities .
but when he died at the age of 94 , the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him .
our ways of approaching agency and authority turn inside out to reflect the reality that no one has the answers to the challenges facing citizens in this century , and everyone has the responsibility for trying and participating in finding them .
though , for a lot of people , the people who step into slavery today don &apos;t usually get kidnapped or knocked over the head .
because there &apos;s a sport , there &apos;s an activity going on that we &apos;re all aware of , that we condone .
you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s no baby in this photo , because that &apos;s not how this works , not for most working mothers .
i was 27 , and i was home from barcelona , and i was visiting my parents for christmas , and i was cooking dinner with my mother , and we were alone in the kitchen .
we are realizing that this is true .
in fact , the secret police of russia was the creator and instructor of the stasi .
that is the original slide from that year , and it has worked in lockstep obedience .
jn : it &apos;s more tangible than world peace , and it &apos;s certainly more immediate .
more broadly , it &apos;s a cryptocurrency .
let &apos;s talk dirty .
they &apos;re very polite and they don &apos;t get so forward so quickly .
and nike knows how to get your pace and distance from just that sensor .
keep to the track , to the beaten track ; memory holds all you need of the truth .
people in the center , like me , started feeling helpless .
the car is so big , the camera is so small , yet the manual for the camera is so much bigger than the car manual .
or you could actually meet my need .
just smart people moving bits . different rules .
so i had absolutely no idea how that could actually work .
so what we did , we went to alaska , which is where the grizzlies rely on really high , almost inaccessible , mountain slopes for their denning .
i see a lot of very blank faces .
we &apos;ve got plenty of these things .
but i &apos;m teaching them to force that savings habit .
so envision what it looks like all wrapped up .
and also , that was true of the reality of trying to educate me .
the piscivorous fish , the cobia , grouper , amberjacks , those big fish , also the tuna and sharks , are going to hit by this .
so clearly there is some effect .
new technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature ; the nature of what &apos;s happening , showing us our impact on the earth .
number three , please all of the people some of the time .
what this picture suggests to us is that we &apos;ve got a radical change in the way information production and exchange is capitalized . not that it &apos;s become less capital intensive — that there &apos;s less money that &apos;s required — but that the ownership of this capital , the way the capitalization happens , is radically distributed . each of us , in these advanced economies , has one of these , or something rather like it — a computer .
the interesting thing about this climb is it &apos;s not that hard .
so we are creating dylan , which is a computational system with an ambitious goal of taking in visual inputs of the same kind that a human child would receive , and autonomously discovering : what are the objects in this visual input ?
i use it every day to measure the weight of an ox , for example .
and they text back .
they said that only 68 percent of the kids come to school on a regular basis , 100 percent of them live in poverty , only one percent of the parents participate , many of the children come from incarceration and single-parent homes , 39 percent of the students have special needs , and the state data revealed that six percent of the students were proficient in algebra , and 10 were proficient in literature .
and nick , he needs to hold vigil for the relationship .
so what we see in the seventeenth , eighteenth century is the continued search for medications other than camphor that &apos;ll do the trick .
so we were able to control for gender , age , income , education , even basic personality variables , and the result stays the same .
i would do these things where i &apos;d have students become pens : there &apos;s blue pen , red pen , green pen , black pen .
i know an american researcher who travels frequently in central asia and africa , alone .
and we &apos;re pretty lucky because here in the south , we &apos;re still blessed with a relatively blank canvas that we can fill with the most fanciful adventures and incredible experiences .
well , studies show that even when we &apos;re really trying to pay attention to something — like maybe this talk — at some point , about half of us will drift off into a daydream , or have this urge to check our twitter feed .
and i carry this around as a symbol , really , of the challenge and also the hope .
what can we do here ?
i use man ray , helen levitt , giacomelli , other people &apos;s artwork .
i managed to stick in both the zeppelin and an ocean liner out of sheer enthusiasm .
try changing it again .
we don &apos;t do the everything else so well .
in fact , the head of harvard &apos;s observatory back then gave a great debate in which he argued that the milky way galaxy was the entire universe .
for three times , i applied to biomedical science , to be a doctor .
so now we indeed are facing many challenges in our times .
innovation happens at the intersections .
so here what we did with jean-marie cabelguen is model the spinal cord circuits .
the same incredible imaginations that produced &quot; &quot; the origin of species , &quot; &quot; &quot; jane eyre &quot; and &quot; the remembrance of things past , &quot; also generated intense worries that haunted the adult lives of charles darwin , charlotte brontăť and marcel proust .
we have well-motivated candidates for the dark matter .
&quot; &quot; well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; &quot; he said .

for example , pumps , the biggest use of motors , move liquid through pipes .
( laughter ) so , a little tether coming off , it &apos;s just a control for the fur &apos;s mouth and his eyes .
the gut is actually the largest immune system , defending your body .
well the answer is , if i drew it on a normal curve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that i &apos;m trying to graph , the graphs look sort of silly .

this is the best you can get in hyderabad in indian education .
this stuff is produced biologically .
they have one of the highest literacy rates in latin america and in the world .
and so if we do nothing to address the digital security divide , if we do nothing to ensure that everyone in our society gets the same benefits of encryption and is equally able to protect themselves from surveillance by the state , not only will the poor and vulnerable be exposed to surveillance , but future civil rights movements may be crushed before they ever reach their full potential .
actually , this isn &apos;t as crazy an idea as it seems , and i &apos;m currently exploring it .
this is how most work today .
it reduces earth &apos;s heat radiation to space , so there &apos;s a temporary energy imbalance .
but what if i could make an instrument that could be adapted to the way i personally behave , to the way my hands work , to what i do very skillfully , perhaps , to what i don &apos;t do so skillfully ?
and together we got through the eye of the financial storm in iceland without taking any direct losses to our equity or to the funds of our clients .
for answers to these questions , it starts with individuals , and i think peer-to-peer security is the answer .
and maybe these healing zones can start growing , and possibly even overlap , and good things can happen .
i guess you won &apos;t be surprised if i tell you that pinocchio is one of my great influences .
and we go to live concerts , and we get that as much as we can .
so you really needed something on your wrist to tell you : what time is it on the earth ? what time is it on mars ?
in that moment , our scholarship can tell you that this is a bacchanal , but if we &apos;re doing our job right , and you &apos;ve checked the jargon at the front door , trust your instinct .
i had really misunderstood the technology .
thank you .
the latest effort to tame malaria started in the late 1990s .
&quot; &quot; i don &apos;t understand . soybeans ?
and if you did , you are forgiven for wondering how a nutt managed to end up in a war zone .
it &apos;s about landscape , it &apos;s about street photography , it &apos;s about color , it &apos;s about architecture , perspective , scale — and , especially , history .
please join us by working together .
now we could compute something related to this , let &apos;s say ... the gdp of spain divided by , i don &apos;t know , the — hmmm ...
you can &apos;t find oiled penguins in argentina .
( laughter ) wonderful news .
it &apos;s a shame we carry .
it &apos;s about design thinking where you have that interesting combination of the scientific method and the artistic process .
it &apos;s just one year of data , but you can see how dynamic the southern ocean is .
and this had to do with the ambitions of the leadership .
she says she first got started with 10 packets of bindis , and then wondered what she could do with 10 thousand .
but each of these three objects has value above and beyond what it can do for you based on its history .
so again , this is 2005 .
not only that , because you have this convection , you have this rising of the air where it &apos;s hot , air is drawn in .
do we want our car to perhaps be a partner , a coach , someone that can use their understanding of the situation to help us reach our potential ?
but we &apos;re going through the haystack no longer with a teaspoon but with a skip loader , because of this increase in speed .
and such skeptics can find comfort in the fourth kind of immortality story , and that is legacy , the idea that you can live on through the echo you leave in the world , like the great greek warrior achilles , who sacrificed his life fighting at troy so that he might win immortal fame .
and this , in essence , is what &apos;s known as the friendship paradox .
and it gets bored , so it will then look away at something else .
a second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream .
so i posed as a teacher and a missionary at an all-male university in pyongyang .
and it was a device that , in fact , is a model of the sky .
okay , good .
it can be music , it can be opera , it can be a theater piece , it can be film , it can be video dance .
( laughter ) so the second story that i &apos;d like to tell is , actually starts in my own house .
unfortunately the other drivers next to us were not paying as much attention .
when someone hands an object to you , you can read intention in their eyes , their face , their body language .
so this is a series i &apos;m hoping to have ready in about two or three years , under the heading of &quot; &quot; the oil party . &quot; &quot; because i think everything that we &apos;re involved in — our clothing , our cars , our roads , and everything — are directly a result .
should we worry . no , we shouldn &apos;t worry .
now , that is sufficiently zany that we would , obviously , jump to the bait , and we did .
( laughter ) but it &apos;s when you put all of these elements together — when you get the viral appeal of a great joke with a powerful punchline that &apos;s crafted from honesty and integrity , it can have a real world impact at changing a conversation .
in the developing countries of the world , this gap is even larger .
faizan peerzada and the rafi peer theatre workshop named for his father have for years promoted the performing arts in pakistan .
and none of this pin stuff would have happened if it hadn &apos;t been for saddam hussein .
( audience : once on purpose ! ) dh : how about if i try first and then decide ?
there was no road map . no one had ever done anything like this before .
and that directly connects to ideas of city-making .
of course , you couldn &apos;t have done that all alone .
( laughter ) now , that might sound pretty good , but ask yourself what would happen under our current economic and political order ?
and even though mount chimborazo isn &apos;t the tallest mountain in the andes , it &apos;s one degree away from the equator , it &apos;s riding that bulge , and so the summit of chimborazo is the farthest point on earth from the center of the earth .
there are other barriers brought about by our laws .
so we think that there is something interesting we can do here .
we can &apos;t travel everywhere .
the big point for me was not being alone and having 10 , maybe 100 people being involved — that was a big point .
and he knows when he comes home , even if it &apos;s to talk about the speech he did or the data or what he &apos;s learned , i &apos;m really interested , and i think we have a really collaborative relationship .
what the nigerian writer chinua achebe calls &quot; &quot; a balance of stories . &quot; &quot; what if my roommate knew about my nigerian publisher , muhtar bakare , a remarkable man who left his job in a bank to follow his dream and start a publishing house ?
and so , to try to persuade you of how totally amazing , excellent and relevant mathematics is , i want to give you my top three mathematically verifiable tips for love .
and then this is a film , on the lower left , that charles and ray made .
&quot; &quot; i wish i &apos;d led a life true to my dreams , and not what others expected of me . &quot; &quot; are games doing this yet ?
best of all , i &apos;m healthier , i know that i &apos;m going to live longer , and i &apos;ve even lost a little weight .
and we &apos;re surrounded by natural light and organic elements .
that &apos;s the stigma , because unfortunately , we live in a world where if you break your arm , everyone runs over to sign your cast , but if you tell people you &apos;re depressed , everyone runs the other way .
community meeting houses are places where there &apos;s very specific relationships between people , like this one in mali , where the elders gather .
it is a statement made by the current front-runner for the republican nomination for us president , donald trump .
so about 10 years of internal evaluation , testing , to get this to a state where we think it &apos;s actually ready .
of course they have to look through a bloody camera in a museum . right ? that &apos;s how museums are working today .
instead of having vaclav smil &apos;s &quot; &quot; massively fatal discontinuity &quot; &quot; of life , we can ensure the continuity of life .
and in the next couple of weeks , she &apos;s going to be among the first 200 families to move into this development .
and what &apos;s interesting is that the salamander has kept a very primitive circuit , which is very similar to the one we find in the lamprey , this primitive eel-like fish , and it looks like during evolution , new neural oscillators have been added to control the limbs , to do the leg locomotion .
and we looked in the literature , and nothing was known about this shark &apos;s vision .
ca : because everyone could see that .
so they get tired , has come dark and rain ; they get weary and tired .
but the other motivating factor is the insular nature of our country .
the wild thing about that trial also , was that it reduced new primaries , so new cancers , by 30 percent also .
i really am worried . wow , there &apos;s so much anxiety . &quot; &quot; and before we know it , right , we &apos;re anxious about feeling anxious .
you have more data .
and that &apos;s something that each and every citizen and voter needs to ask themselves .
they are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters .
make of that what you will .
this assessment , unfortunately , is far too optimistic .
i &apos;m not talking about science that takes baby steps .
and they &apos;re investing in energy .
and is that life still there ?
we &apos;ve got to engage , we &apos;ve got to educate , and we &apos;ve got to have dialogue .
it &apos;s difficult . 2011 , 2013 . freedom tower , the memorial .
if you lose a lot of weight , your brain reacts as if you were starving , and whether you started out fat or thin , your brain &apos;s response is exactly the same .
and then , in the same year , we almost lost everything .
but with this experiment , we &apos;ve confined that same mass to a much smaller volume that &apos;s 10,000 times smaller .
i was angry , i was bitter , and all i wanted was revenge .
he &apos;s working the leg .
the rice in the cereal that many of us fed our babies was developed using this approach .
we call it omega , which is an acronym for offshore membrane enclosures for growing algae .
and that costs on average under 18 dollars a barrel .
as i had no reference point for my body , i began to ask other women about their bodies — in particular , their vaginas , because i thought vaginas were kind of important .
so we were pretty reassured by this .
it used to be very time-consuming , but now it &apos;s nothing .
cities are doing this , but not just one by one .
you guys , according to the rules , are legendary grandmasters , so congratulations .
so that means that we can have some form of self-replication .
here &apos;s one more secret for you : shaking someone &apos;s hand for six seconds dramatically raises the level of oxytocin in your bloodstream , now that &apos;s the trust hormone .
what we decided to do is first look for those ingredients for life .
every year , 60,000 people are newly diagnosed with parkinson &apos;s , and this number is only rising .
and there &apos;s a generation out there that &apos;s grown up on the internet , and they know that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to architect the systems the right way .
the typical post-conflict government is so short of money that it needs our money just to be on a life-support system .
you &apos;re going to have a busy lunchtime rush .
and very quickly , some letters started coming back .
however , although it &apos;s very , very sad this news , it &apos;s also thanks to their personal stories that we have raised awareness of how lethal this disease can be .
but what housman understood , and you hear it in the symphonies of nielsen too , was that the long , hot , silvan summers of stability of the 19th century were coming to a close , and that we were about to move into one of those terrifying periods of history when power changes .
what we &apos;re talking here is not about a sexual revolution , but a sexual evolution , learning from other parts of the world , adapting to local conditions , forging our own path , not following one blazed by another .
just over 30 years ago , the nations of the world assembled at alma-ata and made this iconic declaration .
now let &apos;s imagine that you were an economist in 1929 , trying to forecast future growth for the united states , not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff , not knowing that we were about to enter the greatest economic disaster certainly in the 20th century .
one of my senior colleagues told me , when i was a youngster in this profession , rather proudly , that statisticians were people who liked figures but didn &apos;t have the personality skills to become accountants . ( laughter )
and a fifth symmetry , i can rotate it by five sixths of a turn .
after all , it seems to be dull and abstract , just numbers and computations and rules to apply .
and i expected them to put a ruler next to the wall , size it up with a finger , and make an estimate of the height .
i am a hazara , and the homeland of my people is afghanistan .
what i want you all to do right now is to think of this mammal that i &apos;m going to describe to you .
after that , it had to be kneaded . it had to then go in , kind of , a mangle .
now , i found the answer very quickly .
bg : i am sure that many people here are wondering about your experience as the finance minister of greece earlier this year .
it is about our own commitment to human rights .
let &apos;s look at the next year , and you can see that that trend is continuing .
we will celebrate 218 representatives in the house and 60 senators in the united states senate who have committed to this idea of fundamental reform .
and hold it there , both of you .
what might possibly happen ?
and they &apos;d been working on furniture before .
and as that happens , the heating that we find from the sun is going to become very intense .
so if we think about an extreme weather event that might happen in some part of the world , and if that happens in a part of the world where there is good infrastructure , where there are people that are well-insured and so on , then that impact can be disruptive .
this dynamic data allows farmers to optimize use of water energy while improving quality of the products and the yields , which is a great solution for california , which faces major water shortage .
indeed , this is kind of like the sesame street game of &quot; &quot; which thing doesn &apos;t belong ? &quot; &quot; and you &apos;re right to say it &apos;s the swimming pool that doesn &apos;t belong , because the swimming pool is the only thing on this slide that &apos;s actually very dangerous .
the temperature at the surface is some 350 degrees below zero fahrenheit .
so it kind of was sending a message that only girls are supposed to cook ; boys aren &apos;t .
you were separated from your family by the state .
&quot; &quot; what is life ? &quot; &quot; is something that i think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels .
it &apos;s a natural anti-inflammatory .
we have , actually , a pretty good working definition of complexity .
that &apos;s one of the most profound insights to come out of the historical study of complex institutions like civilizations .
hey , we live in a very noxious world .
so the first question is , why do we need to even worry about a pandemic threat ?
a wise person knows when to improvise .
all those years , all those books , he never got tired of it .
if you put an anti-malarial gene drive in just 1 percent of anopheles mosquitoes , the species that transmits malaria , researchers estimate that it would spread to the entire population in a year .
now , visual thinking was a tremendous asset in my work designing cattle-handling facilities .
they would put 50 pounds of weight on their backs , and board the helicopter for an operation , and they would come back and watch a movie called &quot; &quot; bridesmaids . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) they even wore a thing called spanx , because , as they found very quickly , the uniforms made for men were big where they should be small , and small where they should be big .
this is one piece of good news .
and what we find when we do that is always the same .
now there &apos;s a project that i &apos;m initiating at the moment that i &apos;m very excited about and wanted to share with you , because it is all about changing perceptions , and , indeed , building a new level of trust .
i had frostbite in my left big toe .
my right knee was swollen up , and you could hear that ominous crunch of bone against bone .
to me the real , real solution to quality growth is figuring out the balance between two activities : exploration and exploitation .
there could be all sorts of medical interventions .
let me tell you , it has been a fantastic month for deception .
he was in the hospital for a week , shaking with chills , dehydrated and delirious , sinking into a coma as his organs failed .
but the small animals that eat insects are being eaten by larger animals , still larger animals .
human time , industrial time , tested against the time of the tides , in which these memories of a particular body , that could be any body , multiplied as in the time of mechanical reproduction , many times , placed over three square miles , a mile out to sea , disappearing , in different conditions of day and night .
just remember that single acne spot that crippled you for several days .
this is marie saylee , nine months old .
and every now and then , we do something like a , you know , an automated hair wrap machine , you know , that tangles your hair and pulls your scalp out , and — and we &apos;d make some money on that , you know . and we &apos;d give it out .
this year , i got , what i really have to say is a rather brilliant idea , to laser cut my valentines out of used christmas cards .
paul debevec : so , if we break that down into layers , here &apos;s that diffuse component we saw in the first slide .
and how many previous times do you think they &apos;ve been in prison ?
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s truly possible to express in words what it &apos;s like not to be able to communicate .
that &apos;s 3.2 billion people .
this is something i did for sony in 1996 .
it &apos;s much easier and more lucrative to market a technological fix for these gaps in health than to deal with the structural inequities that produce them .
and we try to test whether actually assisting your imagination by looking at the face of your future self can change you investment behavior .
and the good side of that is that we can be a part of the solution .
so we need to find smarter , more systems-based , innovative solutions to these problems , if we &apos;re going to start to live sustainably within this world .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether or not it means not doing all the work i assign and not getting a good grade in my courses .
people on the east coast in 1849 , when they first started to get the news , they thought , &quot; &quot; ah , this isn &apos;t real . &quot; &quot; but they keep hearing about people getting rich , and then in 1850 they still hear that . and they think it &apos;s not real .
why ? because as your attention shifts to your cell phone , you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly to the car braking in front of you , and so you &apos;re much more likely to get engaged into a car accident .
but the materiality matters too , because in every society that anthropologists have looked at , material stuff operates as a kind of language — a language of goods , a symbolic language that we use to tell each other stories — stories , for example , about how important we are .
( applause ) they also stay in their jobs 15 percent longer , by the way .
if you open any cell of the matrix , you find another 20-dimensional matrix .
there are nine billion humans coming our way .
for example , this &quot; &quot; citizens united &quot; &quot; ruling is a disaster , because it means there &apos;s like a money gun aimed at your head , and if you step out of line , if you try to reach across the aisle , there &apos;s a ton of money waiting to be given to your opponent to make everybody think that you are a terrible person through negative advertising .
but anyway , for some reason , i promised myself that i wasn &apos;t going to move , that i was going to do this thing that mummy wanted me to do .
it looks like a beautiful photograph .
( laughter ) and just as he &apos;s writing , you know , bacteria that will be smaller , he &apos;s writing genomes that will work , we could write smaller programs that would do what microsoft word does .
or , you know , vib-ribbon was not distributed here in the united states .
so then i said , &quot; &quot; nets , what do i do ? &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; why don &apos;t you send me your paintings ?
the best collaboration , of course , is with children .
my colleagues at johns hopkins were among the best .
this temporarily effectively banned autonomous weapons in the u.s. military , but that directive needs to be made permanent .
you get damaged wiring .
perhaps you &apos;ve been at home for a week on your own .
odysseus would have said , &quot; &quot; okay , let &apos;s do a dry run .
we turn on the faucet , the water comes out , we assume it &apos;s safe , and we assume that we are masters of our environment , rather than being part of it .
now , usually , when international audiences hear about that part of the world , they often just want that conflict to go away .

the last component is the operating system that manages the whole network .
who i am really doesn &apos;t matter at all .

and after six months , the nerves grew in well , and you could see strong contractions .
we were the best that they could do .
decades later and dozens of countries from all around the world have launched thousands of more satellites into orbit , and the frequency of launches is only going to increase in the future , especially if you consider things like the possibility of 900-plus satellite constellations being launched .
he tried the marketing solution , which is he declared the potato as a royal vegetable , and none but the royal family could consume it .
if you google regret and tattoo , you will get 11.5 million hits .
the second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers-on .
yes , for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today , but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage , prostitution , forced labor — they have children that they don &apos;t want or they cannot feed .
it flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins , gets lift , powers its movements with a lunate tail .
and then the third part is , what are the potential problems , or the dark side of blogs as we know them ?
in a world with no systems , with chaos , everything becomes a guerilla struggle , and this predictability is not there .
it &apos;s this hair that &apos;s above the eyes , and below it , it &apos;s longer .
tr : right , so this is less than a $ 1,000 solution .
there are great things being done there , treating now autism , dementia and other conditions .
and we contrast that to the other way , an invention that happened after the second world war , suburban sprawl , clearly not compact , clearly not diverse , and it &apos;s not walkable , because so few of the streets connect , that those streets that do connect become overburdened , and you wouldn &apos;t let your kid out on them .
and for the first time , i started to think about how we made decisions .
time for some thermodynamics .
the answer is what i call &quot; &quot; ancient food miles . &quot; &quot; basically , rome had access to the sea , which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away .
so i want to talk to you about two things tonight .
and what we gain with a new technology , of course , is precision and accuracy .
the hit delivered by — david camarillo : sorry , three times is probably a little excessive there .
if you raise questions about that formulation , you really are considered a bit of an antique .
we &apos;re not even slowing down .
perhaps we are not at a stage in africa where many actors and small enterprises leads to growth through competition .
delivering the power and the bandwidth into the ocean will dramatically accelerate adaptation .
it &apos;s not something you want to put on your facebook page , right ?
so for example , we would put models under an artificial sky .
and then he had to clarify that he wasn &apos;t talking about them .
they &apos;re watching their own brain activation , and they &apos;re controlling the pathway that produces their pain .
that ended the discussion .
you know what ? six of those seven voted yes in favor of the bill , so it passed , and it passed by a vote of 47 to 32 .
especially if you breathe air , it &apos;s very hard to get from planet a to planet b , because there &apos;s no air in between . but if you breathe air — ( laughter ) — you &apos;re dead — ( laughter ) — as soon as you &apos;re off the planet , unless you have a spaceship .
and our translation of that , using a lot of the thinking built up over the 40 years , is to say , what if that , instead of being just a pipe , what if it is a lifeline ?
and when we met him he was very resistant .
it was like leaving our mark on society , to say , &quot; &quot; i was here , &quot; &quot; on the top of a building .
we believe in thinking differently .
we wanted to go tackle this problem in a very different direction .
but barbecue &apos;s interesting , because it &apos;s one of these cult foods like chili , or bouillabaisse .
because i can &apos;t explain otherwise , when i look at the figures , what &apos;s going on .
fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us .
and so we had our first meeting , after three months , in tiburon , which is just up the road from here — you know tiburon ?
so , that &apos;s how it walks . but when you look at us human being , bipedal walking , what you &apos;re doing is you &apos;re not really using a muscle to lift your leg and walk like a robot . right ?
well , the argument in &quot; &quot; the blank slate &quot; &quot; was that elite art and criticism in the 20th century , although not the arts in general , have disdained beauty , pleasure , clarity , insight and style .
and he tried to get their opinions on his patients .
europe had to be dragged into economic development .
and i figured , this has to stop .
so one of them was fairly straightforward .
not that there &apos;s a lot of competition , right ?
and we split these bridges .
in other words , the beer-maker knows also how to evoke flavor from the grains by using sprouting and malting and roasting .
let me give you an example of what i mean by harmless but taboo sexual practice . we gave them scenarios .
and the most immediate thought when i came out of that water was the following : i &apos;m never , ever going to do another cold water swim in my life again .

you can take them out of the vertebrate skeleton , you can culture them in petri dishes in the laboratory , and they are dying to form cartilage .
and he admitted to me that he was perplexed by their success .
and also , make it socially acceptable that we change our minds , or probably even reward that ?

( piano notes ) you can see how — you get a sense of playing with derek .
the man who had his eyes wide open , he might lend it to me , and if i didn &apos;t pay him back , you &apos;d all know i was dodgy .

this is a picture i took on the lower east side of just a transformer box on the sidewalk and it &apos;s been tagged like crazy .
looking through the lens of resilience , we really question how we &apos;ve let ourselves get into a situation that &apos;s so vulnerable .
and our cybercriminals had done the same thing .
but frankly , i don &apos;t think they &apos;re going to bother in 2035 to send a rocket to mars , because we will already be there .
so speaking of love and the brain , there &apos;s a researcher , known to some as dr. love , who claims that scientists have found the glue that holds society together , the source of love and prosperity .
and i recorded it and we won something called a grammy .
some people in the last decade or two have started creating artwork with technology .
it &apos;s the ignorance . it &apos;s the what we don &apos;t know .
are you going to be able to resist that if it doesn &apos;t have any overt side effects ?
we can inject these dyes into the bloodstream , so that when we do a new vessel and we bypass a blockage on the heart , we can see if we actually made the connection , before we close that patient back up again — something that we haven &apos;t been able to do without radiation before .
this one &apos;s mine , and i think you would really like her .
perhaps it &apos;s never been more important at any time in our lifetimes .
135 million-plus people . think about that .
ca : a lot of people look at the hedge fund industry now and are sort of ... shocked by it , by how much wealth is created there , and how much talent is going into it .
the disease was so terrifying that the president of the united states launched an extraordinary national effort to find a way to stop it .
it was the government that made law function finally .
i made a vow that from now on , every time one of my children asks me to play , no matter what i &apos;m doing or where i &apos;m going , i say yes , every single time .
and , you know , i just have to say , the whole thing with baldness , and , you know , here &apos;s the thing .
and you have to do that .
( laughter ) so , according to this , the australians and the japanese as well as the mexicans are very happy . ( laughter )
and i was invited one day to visit chancellor adenauer , who was looked upon as sort of the founder of modern germany , since the war .
population growth + meat consumption + dairy consumption + energy costs + bioenergy production = stress on natural resources .

i &apos;m thinking about another patient of mine , priya , who is blissfully married , loves her husband , and would never want to hurt the man .

and second , she tells us that she walked upright , but had some adaptation for tree climbing .
if your fortunes are interdependent with somebody , then you live in a non-zero-sum relationship with them .
and these are all volunteers .
and you &apos;ve got to wage war here in such a way to facilitate that .
we &apos;ll fly outside it here , just to see this sort of containment .
and say , labor is cheap , land is cheap .
and after a couple very liberating weekends , my wife and i , utilizing some cutting-edge erectile technology that is certainly worthy of a tedtalk someday but i won &apos;t get into it now , we noticed some familiar , if unexpected , symptoms .
what &apos;s really at stake perhaps here is not the medicine itself but a metaphor .
and then , we don &apos;t have a stuffed spinoza , but we do have a stuffed pavlov &apos;s dog , and i visited him in the museum of hygiene in st. petersburg , in russia .
it &apos;s kind of been taking on that risk . bring it on .
the daughter &apos;s marriage is very special to the mom .
because now , to make this twice as difficult , we &apos;ll juggle the seven clubs back ...
i was a little kid , and i was like , &quot; yeah . i &apos;ll have that . i &apos;ll have that surgery . &quot;
those three trends are the ability to engineer cells , the ability to engineer tissues , and robots .
pjc : and neither had i actually before i started making this film .
any of you who rode the automobiles — was it yesterday ? — at the track , you know the romance revolving around those high performance cars .
now , everyone wants to know what percentage of people cheat .
it &apos;s not going to work ; you &apos;re not going to stop the fighting in afghanistan ; the taliban won &apos;t listen , etc . , etc .
like i said , i just had a phone number that connected me to them .
thank you .
almost two years ago , i was driving in my car in germany , and i turned on the radio .
it wasn &apos;t really what people needed .
and some of the sponsors of this ted meeting are such organizations .
it &apos;s the power of focus .
because of the earth tilting on its axis and those catastrophic climate shifts , we had to figure out how to find better food , and we had to learn — there &apos;s lucy ; that &apos;s how we all began — we had to learn how to crack open animal bones , use tools to do that , to feed on the marrow , to grow our brains more .
but watch its front legs . can you see what they are doing ?
that &apos;s what people thought .
and to get that thing done , you need at least two monkeys to synchronize their brains , but the ideal is three .
tobacco plants can make millions of doses of vaccine in weeks instead of months , and it might just be the first healthy use of tobacco ever .
it &apos;s a big labor-intensive effort .
that &apos;s the critical change that is being inverted by the net .

and one of the white foremen stepped forward and said , &quot; &quot; you are being paid twice the wages of any other workers in this industry in this region and this is how we do business .
it was a thousand hallelujahs and a million oms .
and then i think the other point is that indians today are far more comfortable with globalization .
some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin , and it went around sort of creating its little dna information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because bacteria communicate .
that is the essence of being human .
thank you .
a very small amount of money would get us some .
are you a journalist ? ngo ? politics ?
the climate news , i &apos;m sorry to say , is going to keep getting worse than we think , faster than we think .
and maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them , and bring the rest of your entertainment in .
the robotic arm that you see moving here 30 days later , after the first video that i showed to you , is under the control of aurora &apos;s brain and is moving the cursor to get to the target .
but the academicians couldn &apos;t understand anything that he wrote .
and if you bring them in for internships in your companies , the thing about the autism , asperger-y kind of mind , you &apos;ve got to give them a specific task .
and i decided that if i came here and shared with you some of my experiences , that maybe we could all be a little less anxious and a little more bold in our conversations about race .
and the doctors told his parents he was never going to be able to communicate or interact socially , and he would probably never have too much language .
high pressure builds over india .
if we could play these two sound clips in succession .
this affected my entire body .
one of them ended up with beatrice &apos;s parents , and that goat had twins .
al gore : this is the last one .
as a lover of human anatomy , i &apos;m so excited that we &apos;re finally putting our bodies at the center of focus .
they &apos;re being put out about two hours — the communities that have been around for literally hundreds of years , or maybe even thousands of years , are being broken up and spread across in the suburban areas outside of shanghai . but these are a whole series of guys holding out in this reconstruction of shanghai .
the hum is music . the hum is light and air .
and on christmas day , i was in bangkok with a group of photographers and got a telegram — back in those days , you got telegrams — from time magazine saying someone in korea had died , and left their child in a will to me .

quite a special image , and it wasn &apos;t essentially the image i wanted to choose .
but it doesn &apos;t sound so much , it &apos;s not relatively enough , it won &apos;t make a difference if you &apos;ve already committed 100,000 soldiers previously .
so what we need is something that doesn &apos;t necessarily have to have the performance of the internet , but the police department has to be able to call up the fire department even without the internet , or the hospitals have to order fuel oil .
we &apos;ve learned over time that stars have individual histories ; that is , they have birth , they have middle ages and some of them even have dramatic deaths .
it &apos;s a story about this woman , natalia rybczynski .
that never changes .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are triumphs of the scientific method .
here is steve jobs introducing multi-touch and making a rather foreboding joke .
and so even though mars has an atmosphere , we can see it &apos;s much thinner than the earth &apos;s .
i was thinking that i shouldn &apos;t go because somebody said , if i did , it would show that i approved of the military regime there .
so one example of this that has big resonance in the policy realm is how this plays out on our very real war of ideas that we &apos;re fighting against radical groups .
so a lot of what we see in the mesh , and a lot of what we have in the platform that we built allows us to define , refine and scale .
we &apos;re trying to design new scenarios for space that have fully reconfigurable and self-assembly structures that can go from highly functional systems from one to another .

and what i &apos;ve tried to do since i had my training as a medical illustrator — since i was taught animation by my father , who was a sculptor and my visual mentor — i wanted to figure out a way to help people understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences by using animation , by using pictures , by telling stories so that the things that are not necessarily evident to people can be brought forth , and can be taught , and can be understood .
well , if you remember before world war ii , japan had a vision for a greater japanese co-prosperity sphere .
and every kid , you know , as a teenager , has got his bedroom he retreats to — but i wanted my door , i thought it would be cool if my door went up rather than opened , like on star trek .
it is a user-appropriate technology that has been used for humanitarian good to great effect .
and this shows that engineers , medical people , scientific people , have an obsession with solving the problems of reality , when actually most problems , once you reach a basic level of wealth in society , most problems are actually problems of perception .
orient your loop this way .
i guess people don &apos;t talk to their uber drivers .
he touches his food , it turns into gold .
people aren &apos;t close or distant .
i &apos;m connected to 80,000 people around the world , and that &apos;s four madison square gardens full of cousins .
the truth be told , i was giving out of that place , not out of a genuine place of hope and excitement to help and of generosity .
i was there to solve world hunger .

so today i &apos;m going to take you on a voyage to cast light on some of the outdated myths and legends and assumptions that have kept us as the true stakeholders in the high seas in the dark .
robots , not just humans , will help us to brave the disaster zones to save the trapped and wounded .
thank you .
we would lose all of our market . &quot; &quot; and people were very angry , and they called him horrible names .
and still a third group got a message about being good citizens , preventing blackouts .
and we can create those positive peer-to-peer relationships on and offline , we can support and educate the next generation of hackers , like myself , instead of saying , &quot; &quot; you can either be a criminal or join the nsa . &quot; &quot; that matters today .
however , we were sneaky , and we proposed more : to convert riverbanks into pedestrian pathways , and then to connect these pathways back to the city fabric , and finally to convert the urban voids along the riverbanks into public spaces that are lacking in the medina of fez .
so we have to do something that &apos;s a little bit more intelligent than doing this .
so here we can see the white represents low altitudes , and the blue are higher altitudes .
it became the media .
and what you can see here is the beginning of an industry in a test tube , a mining industry that is in harmony with nature .
we &apos;ve lots of blood vessels in there .
there was a teenager from ohio — let &apos;s call her jennifer , for the sake of her privacy .
or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders .
i &apos;ll go along with that too .
so that &apos;s what the mountain taught us .
the internet has been doubling in power and continues to , measured many different ways .
that information then needs to be connected to choices , needs to be connected to a range of options , directions that we might go to — trade-offs , benefits .
so let &apos;s give this a try .
now , you may not believe in ancient sayings .
and especially since about 2007 , when i got an iphone , i was not only sitting in front of my screen all day , but i was also getting up at the end of the day and looking at this little screen that i carried in my pocket .
but at the same time , there will be periods when i think is all that really hard work really worth my while ?
thank you for inspiring them and for inspiring all of us .
bin laden is dead . bin ladenism has been defeated .
so returning to the droplet , again , thinking about the universe in a new way .
have a go : poem 1 : little fly / thy summer &apos;s play , / my thoughtless hand / has brush &apos;d away .
so she said to us , &quot; &quot; look , i &apos;ve been heading this department for the last two years .
so , that &apos;s just one use . incredible , there is probably 350 , 400 uses .
but today , our relationships are all but written off by our politics , our social policies , our welfare institutions .
and in the course of 30 days after a hospital stay for a medicare greater than 65 years or older , is — 27 percent are readmitted in 30 days , and by six months , over 56 percent are readmitted .
well , i got on the phone with a few people in the company ; no one could give me a straight answer until finally , i got on the phone with the head biologist .
it &apos;s in our hands .
and then this bubbling , this membrane bubbling , is the hallmark of apoptosis in this cell .
no one is closer to chancellor merkel than the swiss diplomats .
so i grew up in new york , i grew up in brooklyn as a matter of fact , and i went to new utrecht high school and i graduated from brooklyn college .
which is an area along the amur river , which is up here .
secondly , it breaks down a lot .
fast-forward more than two decades : apple launches the iphone in china and censors the dalai lama out along with several other politically sensitive applications at the request of the chinese government for its chinese app store .
the plaque reads , &quot; &quot; albert einstein lived here . &quot; &quot; and i &apos;d like to end with a vignette , as it were , inspired by this image .
they find me up on the top terrace .
sp : if you let fear get to you , then you &apos;re not going to be doing your job .
( laughter ) now , if you think about that story for a moment , i think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in .
and , of course , they &apos;re basically extinct now .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about today is a device that we &apos;ve been working on that i think has the potential to make a difference , to be much more effective , and what i wanted to do is show you how it works . okay , so let me back up a little bit and show you how a normal retina works first so you can see the problem that we were trying to solve .
our goal for robotics is to unlock everyone &apos;s mental power by making the world more physically accessible to people such as myself and others like me around the globe .
now , a specific thing for this particular version of the project is that i &apos;m very interested to see how we can connect with the local population , the native population .
now , you don &apos;t find any kund ; they are all submerged .
and i think what this leads to is a very simple recognition , that there &apos;s one question in politics at the moment above all other , and it &apos;s this one : how do we make things better without spending more money ?
would the good microbes do battle with the bad microbes and help to restore their health ?
and most of all , he would teach it .
i &apos;m going to focus on scientists and engineers because i have some data on that , and i &apos;m a data person .
how can the bible be so barbaric in some places , and yet so incredibly wise in others ?
my lady , it is my husband &apos;s child .
what they do now is : they can grow crops in the rainy season but they can &apos;t grow them in the off-season .
we cherish the opportunity to have our say , to help decide the future of the country .
but consider a same-sex couple like my friends sarah and emily .
as a result , we &apos;re tuned in to the subtlest things that could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering , in order to believe whether these things are realistic .
it &apos;s commonly reported in ukraine that children , when leaving the orphanage are targeted for human trafficking , child pornography and prostitution .
i will take enough of these . mm .
i was the kind of religious where i heard parents tell children when they &apos;re leaving on a two-year proselytizing mission that they would rather have them die than return home without honor , having sinned .
and i want you to see , this is fuku , a young female , and she is quietly playing with water .
but you get these resources together .
we are running late .
because it &apos;s only when you do that , that you can talk about — ( laughter ) — it &apos;s only when you do that , &#91; that &#93; you can talk about how we looked like and how we behaved at different times , and how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time .
before they went through the social stress test , they were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful .
as : what this scene is doing , and it did in the book , is it &apos;s fundamentally making a promise .
( laughter ) we &apos;re hardwired to become leaders of the pack .
we need , especially in technology , we need revolutionary change , not incremental change .
ss : so , then aimee makes it to the 1996 paralympics , and she &apos;s all excited . her family &apos;s coming down — it &apos;s a big deal .
and it &apos;s sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to california in the hope of getting happier .
he types &quot; &quot; opossum &quot; &quot; into this official knowledge base .
my passions are music , technology and making things .
lp : how on earth did we do that ?
we spend so much time talking past each other and not enough time talking through our disagreements , and if we can start to find compassion for one another , then we have a shot at building common ground .
people were expecting me to talk about my beloved sydney swans football team .
if estimates are correct that about one to two percent of all suicides involves the murder of another person , when suicide rates rise , as they are rising for some populations , the murder-suicide rates will rise as well .
thank you for listening .
hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery .
so we &apos;re able to do the simulation , but this is two days on a desktop .
in our fuel cells , we do it with platinum ; life does it with a very , very common iron .
another thing you can try , is switching from active communication and collaboration , which is like face-to-face stuff — tapping people on the shoulder , saying hi to them , having meetings , and replace that with more passive models of communication , using things like email and instant messaging , or collaboration products , things like that .
and that happened because this one person had a documentary instinct , which was to post a status update , which is what we all do now , so if something happens , we put our status update , or we post a photo , we post a video , and it all goes up into the cloud in a constant stream .
so we talked for a few minutes , and he said , &quot; why don &apos;t you tell them what you believe ? &quot;
eighty percent of the people in the world have no food safety net .
it extracts regions with dark contrast , which will show up on the video as red .
so that got our attention , and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with stuxnet and checked this thing out .
the moral of this story is all these narratives about rise and fall and decline tell us a lot more about psychology than they do about reality .
we cannot afford to be color blind .
( music ) on memorial day , we released &quot; &quot; the national mall , &quot; &quot; a location-aware album released exclusively as a mobile app that uses the device &apos;s built-in gps functionality to sonically map the entire park in our hometown of washington , d.c.
they bring it back and feed it to the larvae .
and we &apos;re getting this mass-manufactured .
the u.n. broadband commission has recently set targets to help broadband access in 50 percent of the developing world , compared to 20 percent today .
now , imagine having granular control over everything in the world .
and then , i was overwhelmed with shame .
a nice visual composition of symmetry .
everybody likes the aquatic theory .
there &apos;s an experiment i think daniel pink refers to where you put two dogs in a box and the box has an electric floor .
but why is it so low ?
man &apos;s best friend in the fight against malaria .
since the dawn of human history , we &apos;ve tried to rectify this imbalance by making art , writing poems , singing songs , scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper , gossiping with friends . this is nothing new .
and she was like , &quot; &quot; oh , that &apos;s interesting . &quot; &quot; the guy across the street , he was a black guy .
and that meant sometimes we got our phone disconnected , or our lights turned off , or we got evicted .
indeed , i was the youngest member of any delegation in the 1980 convention that elected ronald reagan to be the republican nominee for president .
so a pantograph is a mechanical structure which keeps the upper segment and the lower segments always parallel .
we don &apos;t live beneath the sky . we live within it .
so the procession is moving at a stately pace down my street , and as it approaches my house , i start to wave my flag vigorously , and there is the queen mother .
and it &apos;s easy for me as well to train someone who has already passed through the experience of disability .
how do we tap into this ?
so everybody here has a lot of experience with chairs and apples and dogs , and based on this , you could see unfamiliar examples and you could guess , you could sit on the chair , you could eat the apple , the dog will bark .
it just so happens that stewart &apos;s brand of funny doesn &apos;t work unless the facts are true .
and you hear a rustle in the grass .
otherwise , we &apos;re going to keep pouring oil all over our mental engines and suffering the consequences .
you can feel the dynamism of this living , breathing community .
you know , a lot of medicine is very high risk .
furthermore , if we &apos;re going to really take seriously the need to ensure people share in the economic benefits , our businesses and corporations need a model of globalization that recognizes that they , too , have to take people with them .
and i wanted to let you know , a lot of the things you &apos;ve heard about australians are true .
now , to close the gap , germany has to significantly increase migration , get many more women in the workforce , increase retirement age — by the way , we just lowered it this year — and all these measures at once .
and we put them into one of these experiments , as you &apos;ve seen earlier , and then we watch lively movement that comes out .
let &apos;s have a look at this nice code that is coming from a renaissance book .
( video ) &#91; in spanish &#93; loudspeaker : what kind of city do you want ?
and so through this piano keyboard , we have the means to take a musical process and study it .
if you want to put a colored disk , well all these seven colors coalesce .
and i &apos;d like to take you there , to that morning , for just a quick video .
let me show it to you .
well , obviously not . it would be absurd if we were to engage again in the kind of operations we were engaged in , in iraq and afghanistan if we were to suddenly find ourselves in a situation in which we were imposing anything other than a democratic system .
i &apos;m going to ask that we play it at the speed i read it .
and here you see a brain scan of two children — one who had adequate nutrition , another , neglected and who was deeply malnourished .
the soil is very soft — so soft , that roots can penetrate into it easily , rapidly .
ka : i just want to thank you on behalf of new yorkers for making this happen and getting this done .
and for this one , i want to tell you a quick story .
but in fact he was the person who was most susceptible to the oxygen .
♫ marries me ♫ ♫ well , if no one marries me ♫ ♫ marries me ♫ ♫ well , if no one marries me ♫ thank you .
well , not the one we tagged !
so when wren was on the way , i realized i needed to find a space of my own .
and in that space station we have the genetic material , the chromosomes , within a nucleus .
and i didn &apos;t look like a soldier , that &apos;s for sure .
so , the new festival , it asks the audience to play an essential role in shaping the performance .
we have cells there , typically from the patient .
they &apos;re similar to things that i &apos;ve seen on volcanoes all over the world and even super-volcanoes like yellowstone .
you probably think that the force that i led was all steely-eyed commandos with big knuckle fists carrying exotic weapons .
so don &apos;t fear , this is not going to be a cooking demonstration .
so maybe , you know , there &apos;s no such thing as crazy , and being diagnosed with a mental illness doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re crazy .
we drank a lot of rice wine . we were both so drunk , i couldn &apos;t believe it .
just like a human standing upright without falling over , here we see entropica automatically balancing a pole using a cart .
should you eat organic meats or should you be eating tofu ?
ok . i think if somebody really was drowning , she &apos;d save them .
i thought in getting up to my ted wish i would try to begin by putting in perspective what i try to do and how it fits with what they try to do .
but — and this , of course , is where it becomes complicated — the facts were true , hurrah for archeology , but the interpretation was rather more complicated .
it &apos;s a complicated project .
bp : i was born old .
the key is that civil gps signals are completely open .
it makes no sense for you to fear what is outside of those covers , whether before your birth or after your death .
thank you .
they carried bayonets on their rifles .
( laughter ) and one of the thoughts that i had dealing with these two separate emergences of a book and a baby , and having this event happen so close — that my first thought , when i was still kind of in the apartment looking out at it all or walking out on the street and looking out on it just in front of our building , was that i &apos;d made a terrible miscalculation in the book that i &apos;d just written .
tourism in bilbao increased 2,500 percent after this building was completed .
we are effectively grading someone &apos;s worth to our community .
the most popular news sites don &apos;t do much better .
you &apos;re looking for something that comes and hits you .
campthree is at the base of lhotse , which is the fourth highest mountain in the world , but it &apos;s dwarfed by everest .
in the extreme ice survey , we &apos;re dedicated to bringing those two parts of human understanding together , to merging the art and science to the end of helping us understand nature and humanity &apos;s relationship with nature better .
and it &apos;s kind of the zeitgeist view at this level of the world &apos;s current mythology over the last couple of months .
he said , &quot; &quot; he was not a very careful person as a mathematician .
alice walker has said , &quot; &quot; look closely at the present you are constructing .
my wife and i adore our children .
i &apos;m saying , just do an inventory , expand your social and professional circles .
and have done experiments with about 50,000 students thus far — built , i &apos;d say , about a half dozen schools , my readers , at this point .
... i &apos;ve just ...
( laughter ) thank you .
as you see , everything starts to fade to black , and you see people going to sleep .
be a part of something .
and it felt like technology should enable magic , not kill it .
let &apos;s do something really simple .
but before i do that , let me tell you a couple of things that made this possible .
i discovered that , if i worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials , my hand really wouldn &apos;t hurt , and after having gone from a single approach to art , i ended up having an approach to creativity that completely changed my artistic horizons .
but basically , we have programs now from preschool right through university , with more and more adults starting their own roots and shoots groups .
in kenya , in august , i went to visit one of the v-day safe houses for girls , a house we opened seven years ago with an amazing woman named agnes pareyio .
in this kind of reactor , you can &apos;t do that .
you move on .
our access to digital money and our ability to freely transact is being held captive by these gatekeepers .
but the story is not about these chapters .
i mean , after all , we &apos;re not trees , and most of us are not lobsters .
and i wanted to let my imagination run wild .
what about africa &apos;s capacity to do something about these problems ?
they absolutely encouraged me to take risks , to go , to try , to try . i had an opportunity , an access to a local dance studio , and i had an enlightened teacher who allowed me to make up my own and invent my own dances , so what she did was let me make up my own ballroom and latin american dances to teach to my peers .
i &apos;m not asking people to share nicely in the sandpit .
well , that &apos;s a whole other lecture .
so , i want to see how these things have moved .
and if your employees can &apos;t tell them apart , neither can your consumers . &quot; &quot; now before we started our session this afternoon , i had a chat with gary .
( laughter ) to reiterate the point , let &apos;s go closer into iluvatar .
a foxo is a protein that we found in these little , round worms to affect lifespan , and here it affects lifespan in people .
but i &apos;m actually not here to talk about fiction .
dr : well , it &apos;s a funny thing .
i said , &quot; &quot; excuse me , if i can &apos;t do the stunts , neither can the character . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) ( applause ) this was a part that i was literally born to play they gave it to a non-palsy actress .
either it doesn &apos;t exist at all , or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or some damn fool thing , but in any case it &apos;s not part of science .
and we even went as far as asking ex-commanders of the guerrilla to fly on helicopters with microphones telling the people that used to fight with them , &quot; there is a better life out there , &quot; &quot; &quot; i &apos;m doing good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not worth it , &quot; &quot; etc .
i wanted a better education .
i &apos;ve never seen a representation of a kind of radio interference patterns , which are so ubiquitous and such an important part of our lives .
and this is the only bicyclist that i met in pasadena , so ...
i had no idea how it was possible .
my mom applied for refugee status .
these organisms , how are they insulating against their own electric charge ?
they become rarer because we fish them .
so we have an opportunity to really open up education .
cheryl was the nutrition director at high school in the community in connecticut .
what defines a story are changes , significant moments and endings .
( laughter ) is this how stupid people die ?
and over the course of the next half-year , he slowly learned to approximate the proper adult form , &quot; &quot; water . &quot; &quot; so we &apos;re going to cruise through half a year in about 40 seconds .
though it &apos;s actually true , you know , the reason i &apos;m talking to you right now is because i was born in brazil .
there &apos;s also a mission proposed for space , which hopefully will launch in the next ten years , called lisa .
what have i lost in the last decades ?
we came from two different worlds .
so we &apos;re going to have to go all-out thermonuclear response , stimulate the total cytokine cascade .
but we had to make it fairly robust , much more robust than the robots we build in our labs .
well , what then happened over the last 50 or 60 years , is that goods have become commoditized .
bia started a campaign , and we even watched her school 24 / 7 through webcam monitoring , and many months afterwards , the government changed their minds .
but the day after the apology , what happened ?
and medication didn &apos;t help him anymore .
thank you .
that was a real experience for one of my patients , and when he created his mask , he was able to let go of that haunting image .
don &apos;t put it all in the brain , but put some of the control in tuned feet , legs and even body .
shouldn &apos;t the reputation that he &apos;s personally invested on building on airbnb mean that it should travel with him from one community to another ?
by the time he was 20 , he was an options trader .
i had a sick body ; that was all .
he would know where things would fit in the sky .
that is the notion of investment .
at that time , i noticed that corruption , that grand corruption , that systematic corruption , was undermining everything we were trying to do .
a conductive pen from the lewis lab at uiuc .
you can see this work . it &apos;s on the mouth of the mersey , just outside liverpool .
we &apos;ve allowed judaism to be claimed by violently messianic west bank settlers , christianity by homophobic hypocrites and misogynistic bigots , islam by suicide bombers .
they are culturally invisible . we do not make movies about these .
so , where do we look for inspiration ? we &apos;ve still got bill clinton .
other people are going to say , &quot; &quot; this is great .
we need to get the math ; we need to get the statistics out to the american people .
my seeing her , it wasn &apos;t her , at the mailbox .
you know the words i mean ?
so , it should have happened about 480,000 years ago .
thank you very much .
and we &apos;re going to look at their saving behavior .
after i came back home , i was wandering through the grocery store , and i froze in the produce department .
ok , now let &apos;s look at these three portraits .
i might , after all , know that she wasn &apos;t a good driver .
and in some ways we had hooked ourselves back onto this idea : cells , organisms , environments , because we were now thinking about bone stem cells , we were thinking about arthritis in terms of a cellular disease .
from alternatives to battle disease so we don &apos;t need antibiotics and chemicals anymore , to automated feeders that feel when the fish are hungry , so we can save on feed and create less pollution .
that day i ended up spending nearly 60 .
he was building a machine to do mathematics , and lovelace said , &quot; &quot; you could do more than mathematics on this machine . &quot; &quot; and just as you do , everyone in this room already &apos;s got a computer on them right now , because they &apos;ve got a phone .
when we produce materials , we need to extract them from the environment , and we need a whole bunch of environmental impacts .
if i &apos;m the worst person in the world , you can hate me and move on .
first night in the nursing home unit where she had been in the same assisted living facility , moved her from one bed to another , kind of threw her , rebroke her pelvis , sent her back to the hospital that she had just come from , no one read the chart , put her on tylenol , which she is allergic to , broke out , got bedsores , basically , had heart problems , and died from the fall and the complications and the errors that were there .
that &apos;s because of the language of guns .
is matter evolvable ?
i go down into the subway — i take the subway a lot — and this piece of paper is taped to a girder .
( music ) ( video ) ( children &apos;s voices ) child &apos;s voice : there are more kids in zaatari than adults right now .
of course they must be more energy-efficient .
but the key one really is the encoder alone , because we can team up the encoder with the different transducer .
so they go down one side of the mountain , they go down another .
she took my clothes off , and then she pinned me down on the floor .
everybody says that .
a great deal of them .
the idea there behind these two pictures is that the chinese government can act above rule of law .
and perhaps more interesting , and more importantly , the question is , can you apply this model more globally outside medicine ?
because our home is the universe , and we are the universe , essentially .
if you look at the statistics , the odds are not very favorable to us .
how much worse is b than a ?
she listens , because that &apos;s what people who tell stories do first .
we could look across time at the same people — people , for example , who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia — and ask what the contribution of mothering , of genetics are , and we could isolate third variables by doing experiments on the mental illnesses .
he studied law and philosophy with guidance from mentors , but he also realized that being a lawyer involved persuading other people , so he also studied great speeches and acting .
but anyway , take a look at its pollen .
it &apos;s a plot of intensity of light over time .
ca : and that &apos;s the same with universal flu vaccine , the same kind of thing ?
and they will start to use as much as the old west are doing already .
and with that shift in thinking , we can now start to imagine new questions , new possibilities for robots that we might not have thought about otherwise .
you could apply that to the human brain in explaining some of the behaviors and the functions of the human brain as emergent phenomena : how we walk , how we talk , how we play chess , all these questions about behavior .
doctor healy then subsequently became the first female director of our national institutes of health .
thank you very much .
she &apos;s the one he &apos;s looking at , and &#91; she &apos;s &#93; the one he &apos;s coming for . can you see that ?
man 8 : okay , a12 , right there !
and so i consider myself one of these people , along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists , who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas .
and finally , we &apos;re going to put the marriott hotel and the portola plaza on the top .
what about what we want ?
and i said , &quot; &quot; you know , this is a little deep .
double click on an icon , that &apos;s a cause .
so i &apos;d help her up and take both her hands and help her walk to the kitchen .
and there are people who think that the existence of my family somehow undermines or weakens or damages their family .
famine mostly is a rural event now .
if i do it kind of right , it might move kind of like the real thing .
the scientists must insure that the ice is not contaminated .
it doesn &apos;t recognize an ironic smile , or a happy smile , or a frustrated smile .
if you see the red line , you are seeing the trail of the pigeon ; if you don &apos;t see the red line , you are the pigeon .
so whenever they &apos;d launch a big ship , they would invite some dignitary up from london on the train to make a speech , break a bottle of champagne over the bows , launch it down the slipway into the river and out to sea .
and they see what &apos;s going on .
don &apos;t medicate kids for attention deficit disorder unless it is really , really freaking bad .
but i decided no , it &apos;s a power to prevent , because that &apos;s what i learned when i was growing up .
when you take a picture with your smartphone or digital camera , there &apos;s a lot of additional information saved along in that image .
is change possible in our emotions , in our traits , in our moods ?
it &apos;s trying to get a grasp on you , on the firmware inside the human skull , so that it can recommend what movie you might want to watch next — which is a very , very difficult problem .
so it &apos;s a selfless act intended to benefit only the other .
the lancet , one of the two greatest medical journals in the world , last summer labeled this a medical emergency now .
reviews , ratings , checkmarks : these are the attestations about our identities that we cobble together today and use to lower uncertainty about who we &apos;re dealing with .
so , von neumann was already off in a theoretical cloud , doing abstract sorts of studies of how you could build reliable machines out of unreliable components .
the computer in your cellphone today is a million times cheaper , a million times smaller , a thousand times more powerful .
and now , under the spell of a technological illusion , we could ignore our fears and truly interact .
in my tradition , there is a gift that we have made to other traditions — to everybody around the world who knows the story of the &quot; &quot; good samaritan . &quot; &quot; many people think of it primarily in terms of charity , random acts of kindness .
i &apos;ve described to you the opposite of a success story .
well , what i can do now with my colleagues in computer science is we can create computer algorithms that can analyze the linguistic traces of deception .
and hofstadter wrote a book called &quot; &quot; i am a strange loop . &quot; &quot; in the course of that book , he describes a moment — just months after carol has died — he comes across her picture on the mantel , or on a bureau in his bedroom .
in these rooms , the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well , and when charlie saw this , he got really excited .
so my dream is something like this .
the dog doesn &apos;t speak english , or american , or spanish , or french .
it was essentially india being itself .
and in a place like kruger , the soaring elephant densities are a real problem .
my point is that you don &apos;t have to be neutral to talk .
and i still kept — so , in the last year i &apos;ve been spending time with heads of state and generals and tribal chiefs who all want this , and i keep saying , but this isn &apos;t the real thing .
there are applications you can get on smartphones for just a few dollars that do the same thing .
( applause ) ted is all about patterns in the clouds .
every single time , he &apos;s going to take one of these away and give the monkeys just two .
so just like personalized medicine , while you might imagine wanting to treat every patient individually , what we &apos;d like to do is build models of individual plants and then tell the farmer what kind of inputs every plant needs — the inputs in this case being water , fertilizer and pesticide .
that &apos;s one of the reasons so much of what we &apos;ve come to think of as western science and mathematics and engineering was really worked out in the first few centuries of the common era by the persians and the arabs and the turks .
oftentimes , we think that we have to relate new knowledge to prior knowledge .
no , the boy said to me — the boy said to me , &quot; it would destroy me . &quot;
if you agree with the factual analysis , but you don &apos;t feel the sense of urgency , where does that leave you ?
i don &apos;t want the poetry of the calligraphy to be broken , as it &apos;s art and you can appreciate it without knowing the meaning , as you can enjoy any music from other countries .
so how could the secret of everlasting youth actually lie within the bat genome ? does anybody want to hazard a guess over how long this bat could live for ?
that &apos;s a boeing 707 .
otherwise , go bother somebody else today .
now let me tell you , if you want to experience the visceral feeling of trusting strangers — ( laughter ) i recommend this , especially if those strangers are drunk german people . ( laughter )
they left my chest open for two weeks .
and the second is that it could be responsible for the problem of the cold chain that i &apos;ll tell you about as well .
it shows without ambiguity that there is structural change and functional change in the brain when you train the altruistic love .
so it was pretty interesting stuff .
then they had strangers , many strangers , judge the person &apos;s personality just from facebook , and what they found was those judgments of the personality were pretty much identical , highly correlated , meaning that facebook profiles really do reflect our actual personality .
these robots we &apos;re shipping every day .
and i throw this slide in — this is me , actually , two months ago — and i throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal , chambered nautilus .
they said , we &apos;ve been looking at the oceans for a long time now , and we want to tell you they &apos;re not in trouble , they &apos;re near collapse .
and the results of that are kids getting sick .
i mean , that would be a bit like asking chris columbus in 1491 , &quot; &quot; hey chris , you know , what happens if it turns out that there &apos;s a continent between here and japan , where you &apos;re sailing to , what will be the consequences for humanity if that turns out to be the case ? &quot; &quot; and i think chris would probably offer you some answer that you might not have understood , but it probably wouldn &apos;t have been right , and i think that to predict what finding e.t. &apos; s going to mean , we can &apos;t predict that either .
and after he would leave , women and girls would stay behind .
well , because we can &apos;t transport books across borders , there had to be separate versions read in all the different english-speaking countries : britain , united states , canada , australia , and new zealand all had to have separate readings of harry potter .
so what i &apos;m asking today , the question i want to explore with you today is , what kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality ?
and the pain is not the problem : it ’ s the symptom .
in between , we want to talk to people about it .
and when the book came out , i was heralded as africa &apos;s answer to frederick forsyth , which is a dubious honor at best .
why can &apos;t we wait for them to die ?
so i want to leave that as a thought with you .
i wondered how we might interface with these animals .
i know it &apos;s not an easy thing , so i admire that you can do this .
thank you .
in the second world war , too , the existence of solar radiation was demonstrated by studies of interference that was detected by the radar stations of great britain .
now if you think about it , in the age before gps and radar , that was obviously a really difficult problem .
( laughter ) and in those days , i developed an ear to identify birds just by the sound of the bangs they made against the glass .
maybe we can collect some good password data and actually advance the state of the art here .
he can &apos;t focus , but he loves walking around and getting people energized . &quot; &quot; no one said , &quot; &quot; get him a coach in speaking . &quot; &quot; they said , get me a tutor in what i suck at .
for about the five years after graduating from an upstanding liberal arts university , this was my day job .
that makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research .
by doing that , we &apos;ve been able to make a superfiber which is about 380 percent tougher , and 300 percent more elastic .
ab : no , we need to be polite about differences .
one trend that we notice in all those things is that the amount of energy per gram per second that flows through this , is actually increasing .
anybody who sees this project plan needs to immediately say , &quot; i want to do this — and there &apos;s my spot ! &quot;
and off we go .
most of them are pretty basic .
as i moved through , i achieved a very reasonable facsimile of the maltese falcon .
and this is one of the ways you can study play — is to get a 256-lead electroencephalogram .
remember , our evolutionary-conserved sequences we &apos;re using on this array allow us to detect even novel or uncharacterized viruses , because we pick what is conserved throughout evolution .
years go by , of course , and the writing , it doesn &apos;t happen instantly , as i &apos;m trying to convey it to you here at ted .
nobel prize nominee hernando de soto recognized that the key to economic liftoff for most developing countries is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land .
i &apos;m trying to say we have to combine all the systems , and with one condition : never — if you have a subway , if you have surface systems , if you have any kind of system — never compete in the same space .
recently , i flew over a crowd of thousands of people in brazil playing music by george frideric handel .
every time i sort of pushed one down , another one would pop back up again .
and then you see a date .
the sciences , to me , are manifestations of our attempt to express or share our understanding , our experience , to influence the universe external to ourselves .
so there &apos;s a certain performance level that the computer would need to get to .
they are bird-blending machines .
gloria stuart : that was the last time titanic ever saw daylight .
but chances are the postcard image you have in your brain is one of these , the dromedary , quintessential desert creature — hangs out in sandy , hot places like the middle east and the sahara , has a big old hump on its back for storing water for those long desert treks , has big , broad feet to help it tromp over sand dunes .
we &apos;ll look at ocean warming .
now this is what you do , is you bend both these legs into a triangle , and you just wrap some tape around .
but why ?
but how would that machine then interact with reality ?
i was doing a pathetically slow speed of about 1.3 knots , and they were doing only marginally less pathetic speed of about 1.4 : it was like two snails in a mating dance .
so , let me show them to you . that &apos;s one , two three , four , five .
it &apos;s brilliant , right ?
my solution : forget micro-entrepreneurs .
i actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier for creative experimentation , if you will , that we &apos;ve explored and begun to settle this wild land of the internet and are now just getting ready to start to build structures on it , and those structures are the new formats of storytelling that the internet will allow us to create .
bats are also threatened in the u.s.
by which this might happen .
there are other parasites that do this — which render the host sterile .
that &apos;s the smashing part of the heel on both these images , and it gets worn away . in fact , i &apos;ve seen them wear away their heel all the way to the flesh .
but at the same time , you see this video coming up here .
global citizens , innovators , business leaders , individuals , we need you .
and i held out my hand , reaching for something to believe in .
i think i was afraid that we would become inadvertent icons for the process of falling in love , a position i did not at all feel qualified for .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re changing the perception of insects .
it &apos;s a place where people have the longest disability-free life expectancy in the world .
wk : yeah . the windmill .
( applause ) number four : giant solar flares .
it &apos;s the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all .
and here &apos;s one example that &apos;s really exciting .
but i managed to do it .
well , it &apos;s not so surprising that they &apos;ve gone extinct . ( laughter ) but in fact that &apos;s not why they went extinct .
but grind it , roast it , package it , put it on a grocery store shelf , and now it &apos;ll cost five , 10 , 15 cents , when you treat it as a good .
anna deavere smith famously said that there &apos;s a literature inside of each of us , and three generations later , i was part of a project called storycorps , which set out to capture the stories of ordinary americans by setting up a soundproof booth in public spaces .
something between 20 and 25 percent of all life forms on the planet , including plants , are beetles .
why is this ? i used medical college girls .
metallic objects — albeit very small ones , a few tons at most — escaped into orbit around the earth .
( music ) in the year of my birth the nintendo entertainment system also went into development .
but i have now a message to the ladies .
here , all this food comes off this farm , and at the end of the season there is actually more soil , more fertility and more biodiversity .
but torvalds said , &quot; &quot; no , i &apos;m not going to do that . &quot; &quot; his point of view on this was very clear .
and basically , we started this because we were tired of complaining about our politicians .
as you can see , sometimes a subspecies branches off .
the same countries , the same measure of inequality , one problem after another .
one two years earlier had killed more than a million people .
an anti-sandinista guerrilla was mortally wounded as commander zero attacked a town in southern nicaragua .
so i &apos;m going to talk a little about each of them .
visitors are transient . we want people who live here , people who have ownership . &quot; &quot; and so what we &apos;re doing is making a broad array of different ways for people to actually engage with the material inside of these galleries , so you can still have a traditional gallery experience , but if you &apos;re interested , you can actually engage with any individual artwork and see the original context from where it &apos;s from , or manipulate the work itself .
they &apos;re going to work on the genomes of the passenger pigeon and the band-tailed pigeon .
i did comic book arbitrage .
and that source is design for generosity .
or is this just right for this place ?
see , some have decided a priori what kinds of changes they want to see , and only such changes can be called political reform .
einstein said this : &quot; &quot; if you can &apos;t write about a subject , in a simple way , it &apos;s because , in fact , you don &apos;t understand it . &quot; &quot; so , if you ... ( applause ) to einstein ... ( applause ) to einstein ... ( applause ) so — ah , ah , i don &apos;t have time ! — so , if you do know what you want to say — don &apos;t you ? — you are aware of what you want to say , you just have to do one thing : believe that it is possible to write in a simple way .
we know from ice core research that the transition from these cold conditions to warm conditions wasn &apos;t smooth , as you might predict from the slow increase in solar radiation .
so i think women in our society are becoming leaders , because they realize that for their future generations , it &apos;s very important to maintain our cultural identities .
and there &apos;s two things i do : when i go into a gallery , first of all , i go quite fast , and i look at everything , and i pinpoint the ones that make me slow down for some reason or other .
it &apos;s just love .
( applause ) thank you .
and i think these words really nail it : &quot; &quot; it means a society based upon the opinion of civilians .
the green ocean has the same clean air , but forms a lot of rain .
but in fact , what we &apos;ve seen is none of those were true .
( laughter ) and then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these — look like jellyfish legs , also polyurethane .
it &apos;s the number one killer of women in the united states today .
a year ago in kenya we had post-election violence .
but this phenomenal project &apos;s been happening .
thank you .
and what that means is , you are going to walk around with your own personal genome on a smart card . it will be here .
so when google was about to introduce gmail and youtube , they knew that their data storage system wasn &apos;t adequate .
and that &apos;s it , so you can just control it , wherever you want , and it &apos;s just hours of fun . and these are no longer in production , so you have real collector &apos;s items .
the age of the ocean , the tectonic plates , gives rise to a totally new phenomenon that we have heard about in this conference .
meetup is the platform , but the value here is in social infrastructure .
one is tempted to say that today &apos;s pantheon is the internet , but i actually think that &apos;s quite wrong , or at least it &apos;s only part of the story .
so , steven spielberg , eat your heart out .
so when people have started to speculate about what might have been wrong with goliath , they &apos;ve said , &quot; &quot; wait a minute , he looks and sounds an awful lot like someone who has acromegaly . &quot; &quot; and that would also explain so much of what was strange about his behavior that day .
i think it &apos;s important to promote in a more positive way on how we see ourselves .
because we need an international legal framework for robotic weapons .
design is not just for designers anymore . it &apos;s a process . it &apos;s not style .
and by sharing resources , we were able to dig deep — much deeper and longer than most media organizations allow these days , because of financial concerns .
it was developed within a two-year period and used on actual exploratory projects .
from the ease with which you swept away obstacles that no one knew could even be budged .
and i want to mention that these seals were used for stamping clay tags that were attached to bundles of goods , so it &apos;s quite likely that these tags , at least some of them , contain names of merchants .
so , natural selection will favor organisms that are more likely to cause damage .
it became the winning architecture to generate exciting new results in object recognition .
plugged me into the wires , put me to sleep , gave me the muscle relaxant .
so , by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history , selam unites us all and gives us a unique account on what makes us human .
among them there was my right-hand man , najmuddin .
the main unit will then go inside the brain .
there are four things that are critical to stopping ebola .
over the next two decades , we &apos;ll see the demand for energy rise by 40 percent , and the growth in the economy and in the population is putting increasing pressure on our land , on our water and on our forests .
and then he happened to stumble across a post about taskrabbit .
i won &apos;t go into the details of why we think the universe is like this , but it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know .
and you &apos;re not going to get comfortable before you get uncomfortable .
and you can have a hundred million of these homes , and it &apos;s great because they suck carbon .
give it a try .
we need a beautiful diversity of flowers that blooms over the entire growing season , from spring to fall .
we , all of us , are what happens when a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium evolves for so long that it begins to ask where it came from .
so whenever you talk about africa , you have to put up this picture of the world from space , and people go , &quot; &quot; look , it &apos;s the dark continent . &quot; &quot; actually , it isn &apos;t .
they &apos;re more likely to feel intrigued when they encounter something that contradicts their expectations .
she said , &quot; &quot; who is this charles bonnet ? &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; did he have them himself ? &quot; &quot; and she said , &quot; &quot; tell all the nurses that i have charles bonnet syndrome . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) &quot; i &apos;m not crazy . i &apos;m not demented . i have charles bonnet syndrome . &quot;
it &apos;s crazy .
by last count , there were 48 different online markets that i know of .
i started thinking about this and the caviar vending machine and the art-o-mat all together , and some reason , i was one night drawing a vending machine , thinking about doing paintings of a vending machine , and the little vial of my dna was sitting there , and i saw this kind of beautiful collaboration between the strands of dna and the coils of a vending machine .
i mean , they complain about it all the time .
this is kareem &apos;s dark eyes and that &apos;s the white background that you see here .
and maybe these healing zones can sprinkle a map , little dots on a map .
in fact , this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important that i began to think about what happens with old technology .
the idea was to have — the same principal , a divided country — take cartoonists from all sides and let them do something together .
but before i go too much further into that , let me tell you a little bit about how we got started with this idea .
the waste water that leaks out is water that already now goes into that coastal environment , and the algae that leak out are biodegradable , and because they &apos;re living in waste water , they &apos;re fresh water algae , which means they can &apos;t live in salt water , so they die .
and there , in the town , he &apos;s approached by a dog who comes like this — one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries , even in america , i think , in some areas — and he &apos;s looking just terrible .
more specifically , i want you to feel like you &apos;re capable of becoming an excellent long-distance swimmer , a world-class language learner , and a tango champion .
there is a glut of film , the quality has to be raised , they need to go to the next level , but i ’ m optimistic .
people are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy .
and of course , the third motivator , one near and dear to my heart as an entrepreneur , is wealth .
( laughter ) in any case , i didn &apos;t readily claim the feminist label , even though it was all around me , because i associated it with my mom &apos;s women &apos;s groups , her swishy skirts and her shoulder pads — none of which had much cachet in the hallways of palmer high school where i was trying to be cool at the time .
don &apos;t we deserve to be saved ? don &apos;t i ?
i stopped doing surgery about six years ago and became a full-time writer , as many people know .
but it &apos;s the rideshare board , and it &apos;s basically the same thing .
and my position is that men need the very things that women have identified that they need to live the lives they say they want to live in order to live the lives that we say we want to live .
and here &apos;s another image of diarrhea .
one of my colleagues in bulgaria , nevena markova , spent about 20 years studying these profiles .
and it really is reconstructing , quite accurately , teleconferencing .
right there !
what do you have to get in order to be happy ?
in doing this , what we &apos;ve discovered is that humans are literal canaries in social exchanges .
i want you to know that there are farms out there — like bill keener in sequatchie cove farm in tennessee — whose cows do eat grass and whose pigs do roll in the mud , just like i thought .
we now know that there are many planets at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars .
in fact there is little evidence that there is any cognitive ability in a very young infant .
through haiti rewired , through build change , architecture for humanity , aidg , there is the possibility to reach out to 30,000 — 40,000 masons across the country and create a movement of proper building .
this is one of the reasons why mohammed doesn &apos;t really regret dropping out of school right after his injury .
research by catalyst and others has shown conclusively that the more gender-equal companies are , the better it is for workers , the happier their labor force is .
i just want you to name the color of the object .
they want to go in and out of all the places they are because the thing that matters most to them is control over where they put their attention .
it &apos;s the application of massive-scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture .
we will soon be using grid computing to do pretty much everything , like adjust the data and everything that goes with the data .
it &apos;s a little hard to understand that , because you can go to a costco in the united states and buy cheap fish .
so it &apos;s a really nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues , where we &apos;re asking people to make a sacrifice and they themselves don &apos;t really benefit from their own sacrifice .
we &apos;ve all trained ourselves to perform these utterly miraculous feats of memory using a set of ancient techniques , techniques invented 2,500 years ago in greece , the same techniques that cicero had used to memorize his speeches , that medieval scholars had used to memorize entire books . &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; whoa . how come i never heard of this before ? &quot; &quot; and we were standing outside the competition hall , and ed , who is a wonderful , brilliant , but somewhat eccentric english guy , says to me , &quot; &quot; josh , you &apos;re an american journalist .
21 : 00 hours , and it &apos;s just our squad going through today &apos;s events in our heads , whether we want to or not .
that &apos;s the natural cadence of a trip .
a bigger one for you to look at .
so in the last 10 years and the hope for the future , we &apos;ve seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology , a science of what makes life worth living .
if you &apos;ve had any design courses , they would teach you you can &apos;t read this .
once he stepped onto the floor and out of the bed , the pressure sensor would detect an increase in pressure caused by body weight and then wirelessly send an audible alert to the caregiver &apos;s smartphone .
on that view , consciousness doesn &apos;t dangle outside the physical world as some kind of extra .
but the good news is that we don &apos;t have to figure it out as we go along ; we have models , we have examples , like benki and sanghamitra and jianchuan .
you &apos;ve got a coil .
conscious but dazed by the blasts , you lay on your side and attempt to process what has just happened .
i totally want to go to that wedding .
it did not correlate with the poverty levels . it did not correlate .
and they are what give the word &quot; &quot; moonshot &quot; &quot; its meaning .
this idea of fireflies in a jar , for some reason , was always really exciting to me .
if i made the leap into these new technologies , then how did we — what happened before that ?
and an inorganic material would normally be really brittle , and you wouldn &apos;t be able to have that sort of strength and toughness in it .
ss : ok , ok , ok , two things .
no powerpoint is used in two days .
he didn &apos;t recommend me , by the way .
how about the people who can &apos;t do that because they have no access — the people in the midwest for example ?
and here is what we wanted to do : we wanted to make it so that sound from the world gets converted in some way so that a deaf person can understand what is being said .
in mll , it &apos;s the middle set of genes , and in aml , it &apos;s the bottom set of genes .
we just — we go like that , and we imagine that that &apos;s what deafness is about .
this is happening by itself .
three of the original eight entities were suing each other .
and here are the results of this wonderful project that is the system in venezuela .
today , i &apos;m here to share the experience of what it &apos;s like to be the mother of someone who kills and hurts .
we consider first that life has a body .
we obtained an influenza vaccine , we applied it to our nanopatches and we applied the nanopatches to the skin , and we waited — and this is in the live animal .
but she does remember one moment .
we forgot about the entire chain around us .
people were generally aware of this , but most of them felt powerless to do anything about it — until one group of citizens , just 12 regular people , put out a call on facebook to their friends to meet in the central plaza , holding signs with a message : &quot; &quot; renuncia ya &quot; &quot; — resign already .
it &apos;s current pleasure in exchange for future pain .
and he &apos;d tell me how he &apos;s leaving his wife , and i believed him , until i got pregnant .
so i think reason is not just some neutral tool to help you get whatever you want .
now , when you &apos;re faced with a problem , you fall back on what you know , and all we really knew was design .
and so if you &apos;re looking for growth industries to get into , that &apos;s not a good one — protecting natural creatures . human population is going up ; it &apos;s going to continue for quite a while .
these are actually cells that we obtained .
we &apos;re adding life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
and then i started rubbing , very very gently , till some of the edges were quite square . and then i constructed it .
how can we know what &apos;s causing the observed warming ?
a race of advanced extraterrestrials watching our solar system from afar could confidently predict earth &apos;s final doom in another six billion years .
it &apos;s too slow .
and i succeeded .
many of them are too young to run for president , but by putting the issues out there , they are influencing the presidential race .
now , we can speculate and philosophize this , but we don &apos;t actually have to for the next hundred years .
ha : yes , i was working in a tough situation , very dangerous .
we flew into a town that had a static , outdated website and a frenetic facebook feed , trying to structure the response , and we launched our platform .
that would be very sad .
( laughter ) so you can &apos;t actually see them , but it was breathtaking , believe me . ( laughter )
we mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy .
so in my opinion , the research evidence is compelling and the logic of this is compelling .
so , all in all , in an age when the visual image of any kind was rare , tapestries were an incredibly potent form of propaganda .
sadly , it &apos;s come true . malaria , as we all know , kills approximately one million people a year .
there are 168 hours in a week .
and the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty .
this image is totally incorrect , totally incorrect .
i did that . me !
that &apos;s where all these problems come from .
everyone wants an aims center in their country .
i said , &quot; &quot; probation ? i &apos;m already on probation , that don &apos;t matter ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) it was academic probation , not criminal probation .
children dress with very colorful , colorful clothes , and it is incredible to see the power that this has in the hands of kids , in a computer . and i have to tell you that it &apos;s so easy to appreciate the impact that access to technology and connectivity can have in the lives and education of these kids .
more participation , more peer coordination , sometimes distorts outcomes and there are some things , like things , for example , in the medical profession that we want new power to get nowhere near .
we just need a time machine .
the harvard men never ask that question .
she thought my side beat up on her side way more often , that we called them brainless , gun-toting racists , and we both marveled at the labels that fit none of the people we actually know .
and i got really good at predicting how many body bags you would need for the people who were going to die in these camps .
it &apos;s a feature .
they have to try and attract pollinators to do their bidding .
it &apos;s happening .
and the reason is simple : because wind builds up the sand , gravity makes it fall .
and so it was then that i realized there was an opportunity for me to collaborate with these scientists , and so i jumped at that opportunity .
people seem to do a limited amount of strategic thinking using theory of mind .
and we &apos;ve got , as is the case around the world , about 95 percent of all loans returned .
if we ended recruitment fees for migrant workers ?
the girls are brought up to be mothers .
when i was nine years old , my mom asked me what i would want my house to look like , and i drew this fairy mushroom .
and we spent that time designing interactive prototypes for computer software and testing them with little girls .
but i knew that epidemics emerge along the fissures of our society , reflecting not only biology , but more importantly patterns of marginalization , exclusion , discrimination related to race , gender , sexuality , class and more .
in the hospital , they have to speak english .
i remember , for some reason , that they were exactly the same height .
the whole surface of it is covered with 60 million diodes , red , blue , and green , that allow you to have a high-resolution picture , visible in daylight .
the second challenge i have is that i must ask for understanding and even compassion when i talk about my son &apos;s death as a suicide .
now , we were lucky with our hand-cleaning .
like all stories , fears have characters .
through history , people have gone back into their own pasts , sometimes to a precious time in their life , to their childhood , and often , the mind gravitates in the past to a moment of shame , some sin committed , some act of selfishness , an act of omission , of shallowness , the sin of anger , the sin of self-pity , trying to be a people-pleaser , a lack of courage .
this is done entirely using , kind of , the tools that are built into second life , so the innate concept of becoming pregnant and having a baby , of course — second life is , at the platform level , at the level of the company — at linden lab — second life has no game properties to it whatsoever .
what we need to think about perhaps for mission blue is increasing the biologging capacity .
the old-fashioned lightbulbs , the incandescent bulbs — i &apos;m not going to ask for a show of hands of how many of you still have them in your homes , wasting energy every time you switch them on — change them after this — or whether we have them on the stage here at ted or not — but those old incandescent light bulbs really should have been sold as heaters .
that &apos;s what we want to see . that &apos;s why it &apos;s hard .
we can study the way that one person interacts with another person , turn the numbers up , and start to gain new insights into the boundaries of normal cognition , but more importantly , we can put people with classically defined mental illnesses , or brain damage , into these social interactions , and use these as probes of that .
i mean , really , same example : if you don &apos;t like politicians calling each other names , stop clicking on the stories about what one guy in one party called the other guy in the other party .
the next was to add mobility — so , have the screen on a mobile base .
when we think about human capital we think about the things we can measure easily — things like grades , sat &apos;s , degrees , the number of years in schooling .
that if you live in the best climate , in san diego in the united states , or in the shittiest climate , in buffalo , new york , you are going to be just as happy in either place .
and against the odds , we found a match for her , who turned out to be me .
we &apos;re kind of stuck in a loop , perhaps , and this sense of possibility from computing is something i &apos;ve been questioning for the last 10 or so years , and have looked to design , as we understand most things , and to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine .
well , you know , we should expect to see that .
but there was a pretty big problem with this .
i know , i think we should keep them as a surprise .
but what we don &apos;t have is a really good model of human psychology .
people say , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s wrong with having a conversation .
as you might know , proteins are large biological molecules that perform different functions within our body , like catalyzing metabolic reactions or responding to stimuli or replicating dna , but before a protein is expressed or produced , relevant parts of its genetic code present in the dna are copied into the messenger rna , so this messenger rna has instructions on how to build a specific protein , and potentially it can build hundreds of proteins , but the one that tells them when to build them and how many to build are micrornas .
here that same line of text wraps around a fountain in an illustration that can be turned upside down and read both ways .
so finally , i would like to say , so let &apos;s help africa walk upright and forward , then we all can be proud of our future legacy as a species .
then there &apos;s the point of embarkation , that is , the point of transition from ordinary life to being a pilgrim on a quest .
so , when the visitors come , mars walks up to the computer , starts typing &quot; &quot; hello , my name is mars . &quot; &quot; welcome to romela , the robotics mechanisms laboratory at virginia tech .
and we &apos;ve just over the last few years found out that the microbes in different parts of the body are amazingly different from one another .
i have a bunch of other inventions .
but today , the international drug control regime is starting to crumble .
is &quot; &quot; better off &quot; &quot; finding a secure job that you can count on for the rest of your life ?
and there are others who are extremely high .
because that &apos;s when implanted devices inside of people started to have networking capabilities .
you won &apos;t do that by accident ; you will do that because you are guided to do that .
you might recognize him from the previous demos .
we know that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the united states .
and it &apos;s really important you understand that for civilization to make progress , each generation has to do better than the last one .
so instead of starting little websites like the kids in palo alto do , the kids in shenzhen make new cell phones .
leading with beauty means rising above what is merely necessary .
i worked in tourism for one year in mexico , one year in egypt .
what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and creepy — obviously in an effort to drive maintenance engineers crazy , that they would not be able to figure this out quickly .
so you get to experience that in real time , right ?
i found a problem , a specific problem that actually found an error with that .
i swear to god . i mean , when you look at the box , and you sort of see how it works .
and the bubbles keep moving up there , and this is what the world looks like today .
and we have had some significant successes .
think about it : if you were sitting there in 1750 trying to figure out the big changes coming to society in the 19th , the 20th centuries , automated machines , computers , artificial intelligence , a programmable flute entertaining the parisian elite would have been as powerful a clue as anything else at the time .
then you see his left leg .
another is , you can make ngos accountable .
and so the present self can trounce all over its dreams .
if we add water , what will happen is , this swellable material is going to absorb the water , the polymer chains will move apart from each other , and the entire material is going to become bigger .
if you take the camera above , you start thinking about these numbers again .
this gives a tremendous advantage to the attacker , because the defender doesn &apos;t know who to fight back against .
how do you have safer sex , how do you use a condom regularly if there hasn &apos;t been disclosure ?
and software companies make 35 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades .
now , i don &apos;t want to create the misimpression that china &apos;s hunky-dory , on the way to some kind of superpowerdom .
i &apos;m really worried that , especially kids today , they &apos;re not going to be dealing with this down-time , that they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture , and that everything comes to them , and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it .
more than half .
and that , of course , had been a question i wanted to know .
and i know i &apos;ve performed for some of your companies or some of you have seen me elsewhere , but this is honestly one of the best audiences i &apos;ve ever experienced .
we have like 40 kids , ex-child soldiers mixed with anybody that we feel like we want to support .
and so it is not just what &apos;s happening to these people — whether they &apos;re losing weight or gaining weight , or becoming rich or becoming poor , or becoming happy or not becoming happy — that affects us ; it &apos;s also the actual architecture of the ties around us .
so now you have an evolutionary excuse .
she feels different .
india is coming on line .
and i certainly didn &apos;t do myself any favors .
it &apos;s part of our survival package , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s become so important for us , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re always listening at that level .
but also , these cultures , these indigenous cultures , are disappearing much faster than the forests themselves .
so i &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; mr. huf isn &apos;t going to be very happy when i told him his house has gone to another , into the atmosphere somewhere . &quot; &quot; so to cut the story short , i decided that i had to go back and do it .
as a frenchman , i must say that there are a lot of french intellectuals that think happiness is not at all interesting .
i asked people to anonymously share an artful secret they &apos;d never told anyone before .
again , the research shows that we prefer voices which are rich , smooth , warm , like hot chocolate .
that &apos;s what fear and anxiety does ; it causes you to be — what &apos;s called depth-first processing — to focus , not be distracted .
it goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle , then the junior non-manual , going up high to the professional occupations — doctors , lawyers , directors of larger companies .
choose to see through them .
well , that is what the us government has determined that the cost of owning a car is per mile .
but in a way , you know , it &apos;s the same if i look at you and i see a nice bright young lady with a pink top on .
the answer is : long-lived molecules , because if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage , but then the molecule is destroyed — like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis — then the damage is gone , too .
it would be easier for other people to wear the helmet and record their eyes .
and this is von neumann and morgenstern , who wrote the &quot; &quot; theory of games . &quot; &quot; all these forces came together there , in princeton .
and the next steps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years .
something was missing , you know . i mean , these are — it &apos;s kind of weird to think that someone had to do an experiment to show that , but that was what was going on at the time .
there were like 20 people there .
i actually shared that with some legislators here in the u.s.
they engage in mental time travel . they remember what happened yesterday .
so that &apos;s the good news .
please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike , or breath , is being pulled . just experience the whole journey of that sound in the same way that i wished i &apos;d experienced the whole journey of this particular conference , rather than just arriving last night .
well , in the mid- &apos; 70s , there were not great opportunities for a bioengineer like me , especially in italy , and so i decided , with some researchers from the united states and the university of florence , to start probing the murals decorated by vasari on the long walls of the hall of the 500 searching for the lost leonardo .
so if you take a deeper look at the brain , one of the things , if you look at it in cross-section , what you can see is that you can &apos;t really see a whole lot of structure there .
and so in this trailer i took it upon myself to think about travel , and escape , in an idiosyncratic sense .
i have a wonderful husband , a wonderful husband who supports me despite all the criticism he gets from the society .
you can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem , even if the problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism .
can you see here what japan did ?
in ethiopia , for example , the variation in maize prices from year to year is as much as 50 percent annually .
( applause ) so , very briefly , i &apos;ll just explain to you how this is done , because that &apos;s the more interesting part .
this is a woman who is now working at the orphanage , whose son had been adopted .
does anyone know what this is ?
and you can think of it in terms of a game-theoretic payoff matrix .
since you have to pay for the nurse anyway , the cost per immunization ends up being cheaper if you give incentives than if you don &apos;t .
i made a stacking board .
i plug in again the power to it .
and what &apos;s amazing is , even though we flew very high above this forest , later on in analysis , we can go in and actually experience the treetrops , leaf by leaf , branch by branch , just as the other species that live in this forest experience it along with the trees themselves .
if we can actually have a broader theory of value creation and allow us to actually admit what the state has been doing and reap something back , it might just be that in the next round , and i hope that we all hope that the next big revolution will in fact be green , that that period of growth will not only be smart , innovation-led , not only green , but also more inclusive , so that the public schools in places like silicon valley can actually also benefit from that growth , because they have not .
and with this detailed information about the real quality of life in this part of the country , imazon and other partners from government , business and civil society can work together to construct a development plan that will help really improve people &apos;s lives , while protecting that precious global asset that is the amazon rainforest .
at the end of this day i could have filled a book just with stories about law from this one teacher .
and i &apos;m convinced that those who see their world as movable nodes and links really have an edge .
she earns around 12,000 rupees .
this is really , in fact , a television broadcasting a show 24 / 7 called &quot; &quot; we &apos;re normal . &quot; &quot; we &apos;re normal , we &apos;re normal , we &apos;re normal , we &apos;re normal , we &apos;re normal .
and that &apos;s why you don &apos;t need to model the glass .
and that was actually an excellent business , because we provided jobs for women all around our neighborhood .
are you restricted by , say , racism , from feeling fully at home where you live ?
and there you see the tail of that great beast wrapping around me .
but i &apos;m not going to the east , because i don &apos;t know swahili .
&quot; i will be swimming around in you for the rest of your life , &quot; i told my slightly horrified sister .
we won &apos;t talk about that anymore . it &apos;s too depressing .
the 300 people below deck were doomed .
if you want to go beyond a tinkering , if you want to go beyond a hobby of robotics and really tackle the grand challenges of robotics through rigorous research we need more than that . this is where school comes in .
so here &apos;s the pitch : i think it &apos;s important that we don &apos;t just get on this freeway to icu without thinking hard about whether or not that &apos;s where we all want to end up , particularly as we become older and increasingly frail and icu has less and less and less to offer us .
and i said , well , in the same way that they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization — and then they all sort of leaned in — they let go of a protein that stops the crystallization .
here , every single student has to engage with the material .
ca : traditional wisdom is that it &apos;s pretty hard for married couples to work together .
and i think it would be important for audiences to demand more buttons on their favorite websites , buttons for example that say , &quot; &quot; if you liked this story , click here to support a cause your storyteller believes in . &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; click here to contribute to your storyteller &apos;s next big idea . &quot; &quot; often , we are committed to the platforms , but not necessarily to the storytellers themselves .
all the human intelligence put in organization design — urban structures , processing systems — what is the real goal ?
and you don &apos;t leave them where they are . you nudge them forward .
i &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re buying one military and you &apos;re operating another , and eventually it &apos;s going to hurt . it &apos;s wrong .
and this is bishop , one of our robots .
now that includes the cost of military and the cost of the fuel both .
my partner , m , who &apos;s a tech guru , hacked wordpress .
she &apos;s got a big smile . she &apos;s got a big personality .
you type in what you want , and it gives you the translation .
the courts have said over and over again , &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need any more intellectual property protection . &quot; &quot; when you look at copies like this , you wonder : how do the luxury high-end brands remain in business ?
there was no inflation .
the point is that the news media preferentially feeds us negative stories because that &apos;s what our minds pay attention to .
the perverse at heart will seek out the ambiguities , trying to create discord by pinning down meanings of their own .
i &apos;ll follow the rats . &quot; &quot; then i started going into the tunnels , which made me realize that there &apos;s a whole new dimension to the city that i never saw before and most people don &apos;t get to see .
when i talk to my students about global issues , and i listen to them in the coffee break , they always talk about &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; them . &quot; &quot; and when they come back into the lecture room i ask them , &quot; &quot; what do you mean with &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; them &quot; &quot; ?
so what should we be doing with that guy &apos;s data ?
visceral is subconscious , you &apos;re unaware of it .
i want you guys to imagine that you &apos;re a soldier running through the battlefield .
and the reason it has a fountain in the courtyard is i wanted one and i had the checkbook , so i bought one and put it there .
now , that &apos;s really tough to do with a hall that has 1,100 seats .
child : our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write .
they enter the queue , they just zip right out .
i &apos;m going to make an argument today that may seem a little bit crazy : social media and the end of gender .
i kind of woke up to this bit in the late &apos; 90s when i met this guy .
and meditation or self-inspection is one of the ways — again it &apos;s not the only one — it &apos;s one of the ways of gaining this kind of inner power .
there &apos;s an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there , experiencing the sun &apos;s demise , but any life and intelligence that exists then will be as different from us as we are from bacteria .
he would send me a fax and show me something .
the next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of jam .
everything else on there is a labor of love .
so let &apos;s take an example that we all face : chat — text messaging .
if you had told me that this smart , funny , sensitive man who adored me would one day dictate whether or not i wore makeup , how short my skirts were , where i lived , what jobs i took , who my friends were and where i spent christmas , i would have laughed at you , because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in conor at the beginning .
so go away from your comfort into a bigger , brighter thing , because that is how we will stop another ferguson from happening .
what about africa &apos;s population ? the population isn &apos;t out of proportion to its area , but africa leads the world in deaths from often preventable causes : malnutrition , simple infections and birth complications .
the thing on the right is a snake form , a ziggurat .
it &apos;s the only place where you can produce , actually , osmium .
saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons .
and it was also the beginning of our discontent , because if you wanted to distill all of our experience since the paleolithic , it would come down to two words : how and why .
right , bradley , okay , excellent point .
secondly , drug companies are not going to develop really sophisticated psychoactive drugs . we know that most mental illnesses have a biological component that can be dealt with .
and i can get really despairing . i &apos;ve spent a lot of the last few years really depressed about this , until this year , i learned something that i felt really excited about . i feel like it &apos;s really good news , and it &apos;s so shocking , i don &apos;t like saying it , because i think people won &apos;t believe me .
when you try to solve really complex social problems , the right thing to do is most of the time to create the incentives .
i don &apos;t know who the people in your life are .
so imagine that right now i handed each and every one of you a thousand u.s. dollars — so 10 crisp hundred dollar bills .
to really get the money shots , it &apos;s down to being in the right place at the right time .
he did it , he succeeded .
it &apos;s an underwater world we &apos;re all exploring together .
ca : have you met anyone interesting ?
and to do stuff that wasn &apos;t made out of helvetica was actually kind of hard because you had to find it .
it &apos;s a civilizational story to begin with .
madam , it has been two weeks , and the woman has not cried since .
but the minute they began nibbling from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , they fell from their innocence .
now , while preparing for the tour , i had to remind the guys to be culturally sensitive .
now people talk about this a lot , and they talk about things like flextime and mentoring and programs companies should have to train women .
these are just three examples of thousands , thousands of girls who have been socialized to be imperfect , who have learned to keep trying , who have learned perseverance .
we have come up with ways to protect ourselves against these diseases .
so motor racing is very much about attention to detail .
i was the type and the kind of religious where kids kill themselves every single year because they &apos;re terrified of coming out to our community as gay .
and instead of an outflow , you are now getting a net inflow .
imagine pre-growing a village — it takes about seven to 10 years — and everything is green .
yet the haitian story also illustrates some of the bigger problems faced in many countries .
so , you cannot argue with that .
here &apos;s some others .
and while it &apos;s playing , we can pinch and peak back at the page , and the movie keeps playing .
that is oh point oh well percent of the rest of the world .
in a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic &quot; batteries not included . &quot;
it was like breathing .
it doesn &apos;t have the same physical limitations , in that it &apos;s not tethered to a lab bench with extraneous cords , large vats of chemicals or computer monitors .
and i worked in the healthcare industry .
so we &apos;re starting to build a phrase .
and as you noticed , it almost looks around , &quot; &quot; where am i ? &quot; &quot; — and then walks straight to that hole and escapes .
you would agree with me that light doesn &apos;t penetrate through walls .
if i have to ask you who i am , if i have to tell you who i am , if i describe myself in terms of shows and hours of television and how globally badass my brain is , i have forgotten what the real hum is .
he said they were wrong .
and a new generation of engineers and scientists , mostly out of universities , began launching these very small , breadbox-sized satellites called cubesats .
interestingly enough , they also do this with uranium and chromium , and various other toxic metals .
it &apos;s the only spanish innovation , technologically , of the 20th century , by the way .
my parents definitely didn &apos;t think so when i told them at 19 i was quitting my job to pursue this dream career : blue skies , warm tropical beaches , and a tan that lasts all year long .
and these spines don &apos;t always drive you to make the best choices .
and meanwhile , i &apos;m burying myself in the internet looking for specialists .

thank you .
they just use a different strategy .
and as recently as 15 years ago , there were a lot of scientists who thought these technologies wouldn &apos;t work .
that data is logged . we &apos;re logging about 500 different parameters within the data systems , about 13,000 health parameters and events to say when things are not working the way they should do , and we &apos;re sending that data back to the garage using telemetry at a rate of two to four megabits per second .

on dry days , some colonies forage less , so colonies are different in how they manage this trade-off between spending water to search for seeds and getting water back in the form of seeds .

we &apos;re going to talk — my — a new lecture , just for ted — and i &apos;m going show you some illusions that we &apos;ve created for ted , and i &apos;m going to try to relate this to happiness . what i was thinking about with happiness is , what gives happiness — or happiness , which i equate with joy in my particular area , and i think there &apos;s something very fundamental . and i was thinking about this . and it &apos;s in terms of both illusions and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows is that there &apos;s something about these things where our expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing

trickster is a change agent .

studies show that antioxidants are known to decrease these heterocyclic amines .

this is mass general in boston .
the real way that i became a model is i won a genetic lottery , and i am the recipient of a legacy , and maybe you &apos;re wondering what is a legacy .

if i know when i was young , that &#91; by &#93; killing an elephant , i &apos;m destroying biodiversity , i would not have done it .
and i will go you one further .

green is the sort of cool areas where it &apos;s not turned on .
well , what did we do ? we said , we can make a website , we can make an expert network , a social network , that would connect the network to the institution to allow scientists and technologists to get better information to the patent office to aid in making those decisions .
and then we founded a mission-driven company , and we &apos;re developing kits to make it easier for anyone with a sink and a soldering iron to make these things at home .
i mean , but we don &apos;t have a concept of that .
it &apos;s called batting average .
experimentally , this is what we &apos;ve done in the last year .
and we ask them questions that are actually not really answerable , the types of questions that 9 / 11 itself draws forth for all of us .
in other words , if you put onto the roads , as is currently happening , 1,000 new cars every day — statistically , it &apos;s the biggest booming auto market in the world — and the half a billion bicycles serving one and a third billion people are reducing .

it &apos;s 10 by 10 by 30 centimeters , it weighs four kilograms , and we &apos;ve stuffed the latest and greatest electronics and sensor systems into this little package so that even though this is really small , this can take pictures 10 times the resolution of the big satellite here , even though it weighs one thousandth of the mass .
&#91; &quot; &quot; you &apos;re welcome &quot; &quot; &#93; ( laughter ) ( applause )
world war ii changed a lot of things , and one of them was this need to protect people from becoming victims of medical research without informed consent .

glenn greenwald : you know , i think one of the things that happens is that people &apos;s courage in this regard gets contagious , and so although i and the other journalists with whom i was working were certainly aware of the risk — the united states continues to be the most powerful country in the world and doesn &apos;t appreciate it when you disclose thousands of their secrets on the internet at will — seeing somebody who is a 29-year-old ordinary person who grew up in a very ordinary environment exercise the degree of principled courage that edward snowden risked , knowing that he was going to go to prison for the rest of his life
in one case , i flew all the way to malaga with a team because the thing was signed with seals and various very official seals from the city , and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port .

when they were interviewed after the study , all the participants said that they firmly believed that the learning and punishment study served a worthy scientific purpose which would have enduring gains for science as opposed to the momentary nonfatal discomfort caused to the participants .
we believe in risk awareness .
now , i showed this to a physicist friend of mine who has a profound distaste for biology , and he says , &quot; &quot; that ’ s easy ! the things are a different color ! &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) we have to go a little beyond that . now let me explain why vibrational theory has some sort of interest in it . these molecules , as you saw in the beginning , the building blocks had springs connecting them to each other .
bj : and of course , through the night , they lay together .
but you know , sort of &quot; &quot; our brains have been manipulated ; we &apos;re all addicts . &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; addiction &quot; &quot; is thrown around .

open defecation is rampant .

and then the next light bulb was , better than just writing , what about film and tv , to get out to people in a big way ?
by the time the next election comes , i believe every candidate will have to disclose where they stand on the abolition of fossil fuels .
a space that doesn &apos;t always follow us like a dog that has been trained to follow us , but moves ahead into directions of demonstrating other possibilities , other experiences , that have never been part of the vocabulary of architecture .
so this is mr. perry . he &apos;s the assistant superintendent .
there was an article which was run by ap , on the wire .
text messaging : that was originally designed for people who are deaf .
so , that &apos;s very intuitive , and that &apos;s what we want .
if we could do that , this could be extremely powerful .
democracy matters because it reflects an idea of equality and an idea of liberty . it reflects an idea of dignity , the dignity of the individual , the idea that each individual should have an equal vote , an equal say , in the formation of their government .

lidia yuknavitch : i &apos;m making a confession : i stole three linen napkins — ( laughter ) from three different restaurants .
it &apos;s called retro-vaccinology , and its implications extend way beyond that of just hiv .
tr : ninety-nine . well , that &apos;s an improvement .
so we tried to come up with a way , as a group , to have a kind of design swat team .
so the best that our little savings accounts or retirement accounts can do is to try to catch some waves in the good cycles and hope that we don &apos;t get inundated in the turbulent ones , but certainly our decisions on how to steer our little retirement accounts don &apos;t affect the tides , don &apos;t change the shape or size or direction of the waves .
so we began with a card table in the clinic waiting room — totally lemonade stand style .
but he &apos;s about to dispel the gloom by using those bright colors right underneath noah : emerald , topaz , scarlet on the prophet zechariah .
your pupils dilate , your muscles contract , your spidey sense tingles , basically your whole body is trigger-happy . ( laughter ) that condition is not conducive to performing folk music . ( laughter )
he said , that &apos;s what flutes are for — to be played well .
now , if we do that , if we put the resources and the focus to it , what does it actually cost to get people out of slavery ?
this , of course , is not true for the students who graduate from the top institutions , but for many others , they do not get the value for their time and their effort .
i met women running essential oils businesses , wineries and even the country &apos;s largest advertising agency .
let &apos;s look at some videos of what happened when we tested these new drugs in worms .
africa has been good to us ; it is time for us to give back to africa .
( english ) omer my brother , i will always love you .
we was so , so stupid . the most stupid bacteria .
but in gay men , you &apos;ve got quite a dramatic rise starting three or four years after treatment became widely available .
but in the last few decades that has totally changed .
except for my son , who said , &quot; &quot; well , he could have two dads . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) ( applause ) that &apos;s an index , an indicator of how things have changed .
somebody get the front legs .
and what do we teach in these schools ?
i study how the brain processes information . that is , how it takes information in from the outside world , and converts it into patterns of electrical activity , and then how it uses those patterns to allow you to do things — to see , hear , to reach for an object .
so it was pretty obvious after this process that , well , we chicken out here and go away because it &apos;s too tense , or we go even further in asking , what else is bothering you ?
they use these to design with and they design for them , which is why we end up sitting in restaurants that look like this — ( loud crowd noise ) — and sound like this , shouting from a foot away to try and be heard by our dinner companion , or why we get on airplanes — ( flight attendant announcements ) — which cost 200 million pounds , with somebody talking through an old-fashioned telephone handset on a cheap stereo system , making us jump out of our skins .
and if it isn &apos;t then it produces a shape which is very phonaesthetically tightly coupled to the sounds you made .
we can &apos;t pick the future , but we can steer the future .
shared memories — that &apos;s where the old bbc building was ; and personal memories — that &apos;s where i gave my first kiss .
in 2001 , this building received an award .
owl , yeah .
doctor , whatever you say , i accept it .
and what was really great is , i &apos;m putting all this work together in the background , and laura sent me a follow-up email because a good month had passed by .
and that is a slide taken from a tv set and it was pre-processed to be very sympathetic to the tv medium , and it absolutely looks beautiful .
we &apos;re doing this at the cedars-sinai heart institute in the women &apos;s heart center .
1.1 million of them .
it &apos;s saturday . it &apos;s the holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot; because i have to exchange your father &apos;s underwear . &quot;
now imagine what these already ingenious communities could create themselves , and how highly particular their solutions would be , if they were given the basic infrastructures that they could tap into .
( laughter ) this science is different , more general , than the mathematics-based science that we &apos;ve had for the past 300 or so years .
and so that gives you an idea of how exquisitely sensitive this is .
the maasais , the boys are brought up to be warriors .
well , i was very sorry to point out that the pure man &apos;s mind has , in fact , seen at long last what had been seen for a long time .
well , &quot; &quot; rare earth &quot; &quot; actually taught me an awful lot about meeting the public .
and that &apos;s good , it gets two plusses .
what they do best is make a synthesis of human needs , current conditions in economy , in materials , in sustainability issues , and then what they do at the end — if they are good — is much more than the sum of its parts .
so this also works for the house , for at home .
we make it ourselves .
the instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification , etc . , etc .
ca : ed , thank you .
now you might ask yourself , how did he do that ?
so the first example i &apos;m going to talk about relates to children with learning impairments .
and obviously he never came down . the statement was never made .
we were living through a time of tectonic shifts in ideologies , in politics , in religion , in populations .
but i &apos;ll try to convince you that spectroscopy is actually something which can change this world .
it &apos;s been a privilege talking to you .
so we took these hundred dollar bills , and we put them on a website called tenthousandscents.com , where you can browse through and see all the individual contributions .
now , you might think , well , we &apos;re human because of our dna , but it turns out that each of us has about 20,000 human genes , depending on what you count exactly , but as many as two million to 20 million microbial genes .
this fabrication of place could be one of the world &apos;s greatest achievements , because no one belongs here ; everyone does .
let &apos;s say the revenue of microsoft .
some dancers , when they &apos;re watching action , take the overall shape , the arc of the movement , the kinetic sense of the movement , and use that for memory .
now i cannot tell you how incredibly excited the u.s. military was by the news of the norden bombsight .
and , of course , graphics : today 84 dollars and 97 cents at best buy buys you more graphics power than you could have gotten for a million bucks from sgi only a decade ago .
and those are the questions that inspired my new project , which is debuting here today at ted .
( laughter ) just for my workshop .
and the purpose is not to walk in and construct a home and live there .
these structures are called cilia , and they actually move the mucus out of the lung .
so it &apos;s very well known to engineers , not as well known to biologists .
and what &apos;s exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors who are building innovations that recognize that what people want is freedom and choice and opportunity .
and one of the reasons is , in south africa , it costs 100 dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity .
but you &apos;re going to get home and realize how different life is . &quot; &quot; and i got home and something happened .
they carried me around and put me on the table , and put the knife between my legs .
two million years ago humans evolved in africa and then slowly but surely spread out across the entire planet by reaching into the wilderness that was beyond their horizons .
and why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now ?
on 9 / 11 , joel wasn &apos;t in new york . he was out of town , but he raced back to the city , and raced down to the site of the destruction .
they teach us about what happens in the complex organism .
and so for me , a mesh company , the &quot; &quot; classic &quot; &quot; mesh company , brings together these three things : our ability to connect to each other — most of us are walking around with these mobile devices that are gps-enabled and web-enabled — allows us to find each other and find things in time and space .
and again , we can see it in slightly different form there , with the bubble forming and collapsing between those two surfaces .
so we came up with one neighborhood typology — there are several — called a live-make neighborhood , where folks could reappropriate abandoned structures and turn them into entrepreneurial enterprises , with a specific emphasis on looking at the , again , majority 82 percent african-american population .
so that &apos;s , as i said , the little diversion on my main love .
i turn them into two and three-dimensional pieces and sculptures and installations .
it &apos;s as though you made something resonate within them .
or maybe it was 31 and a quarter percent .
let me give you another example of delegation .
particularly if we continue to approach the transformation of organizations the way we always have been .
life in space is really not necessarily about how we do things , but why we do things .
there &apos;s a much deeper connection , which i don &apos;t have time to go into and that is that modern genetics is a really exciting area of science .
here &apos;s the second reason .
they also kiss , hold hands , pat one another on the back .
you need to understand that in those places what really mattered was , firstly , the role of tudman and milosevic in coming to the agreement , and then the fact those men went , that the regional situation improved , that the european union could offer bosnia something extraordinary : the chance to be part of a new thing , a new club , a chance to join something bigger .
now , that &apos;s the good news .
the kids of today , they tap , swipe and pinch their way through the world .
and immediately , a lot of different responsibilities , in terms of my education and so forth , were heaped upon me .
and scientists have a lot of theories about why this is , but almost all of them involve nutrition , namely the increase of dairy and meat .
you look outside : you have all that beauty that you see , all that life that you see around you , and here we have intelligent people like you and i who are having a conversation here .
thank you very much .
if you go on the streets of india and china , you see this kind of stuff .
they also get free land in between the trees , where they can grow their crops .
they did not have any pardas inside their body , hijabs inside themselves ; they &apos;ve crossed the barrier of it .
they sit , they watch the goldfish in the fish tank , they read extremely old copies of good housekeeping magazine .
on the graph paper , you can see how all the lines on the graph paper have been distorted .
since there was nothing there , you might as well not look .
if you wanted to put all of the published works online so that anybody could have it available , well , how big a problem is it ?
( applause ) but something as basic as happiness , which 20 years ago would have been just something for discussion in the church or mosque or synagogue , today it turns out that there &apos;s dozens of ted-like questions that you can ask about it , which are really interesting .
i did it for your own good .
and so they did .
this simulation was run on 1,000 processors for a month in order to make just this simple visible one .
the architecture is telling a story . the architecture is telling a story
that &apos;s the alliance that changes the world .
we set out to do this .
their job is to get things done , and if they don &apos;t , they &apos;re out of a job .
it was a bunch of people who wanted to bring in democracy because they wanted to bring in the idea of universal voting and parliament and constitution and so forth .
and that &apos;s what happens to currencies when you don &apos;t stand behind them .
now , think about where the world would be today if we had the light bulb , but you couldn &apos;t focus light ; if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to .
dude , are you from canada ? ( laughter ) so , like , whatever , with grand theft auto , you &apos;re this kid , like , you &apos;re this guy walking around or whatever , and you can basically , like , the more cops you kill , the more points you get , and stuff like that .
sub-surface water on mars , frozen in the form of ice .
the fundamental issue is that , for me , design is the first signal of human intentions .
that is a bit counterintuitive .
were there things that weren &apos;t being done ?
the thing that was always striking to me was that we as people could have so many really amazing ideas about things we &apos;d like to do , but are so often unable , in the real world , to actually do those things — to actually cobble together the materials and go through the actual execution phase of building something that you imagine from a design perspective .
and i certainly don &apos;t know all the people who might be watching this talk over the internet , somewhere in buenos aires or in new delhi .
the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually scale by strengthening civil society .
( laughter ) we can build a better vine .
columns are architectural archetypes .
so i thought , three words for one concept . this is not good .
we know looting is going on on a global scale and it &apos;s increasing , but presently we don &apos;t have any tools to stop it .
that &apos;s my mom .
and they will need chemistry . that &apos;s the point .
so , it &apos;s a normal-looking syringe .
the damage comes in the form of a double-strand break through the double helix .
and it &apos;s specifically algorithms , which are basically the math that computers use to decide stuff .
each of the 188 members of the imf hold sdr quotas as part of their foreign exchange reserves .
turns out , all he wanted to do was to stack the siftables up .
and my mother bought this book when we were at the grand canyon called &quot; &quot; the hot zone . &quot; &quot; it was all about the outbreak of the ebola virus .
this shift has created what professor nicolaus mills calls a culture of humiliation .
pity , i would have told them it was the ace of spades .
so i went on for the next 20 years or so making a lot of different games .
they need jobs in the public health sector or in nonprofit health centers to put their training and commitment to work .
we collect four gigabits per second of data , if you can imagine that kind of data stream coming down .
at risd , you &apos;re not allowed to draw from an image .
( video ) samantha masters : that &apos;s what &apos;s up , man , this is a righteous man over here .
and this is how we come to care for the common good .
and it &apos;s looking up on the wooded heights of washington heights to jeffrey &apos;s hook , where the george washington bridge goes across today .
and then they talk , and then we pass the baton back and forth between each other .
the support may come in asking people questions , giving them a sheet of paper that has an organizational chart on it or has some guiding images , but we need to support it .
and i couldn &apos;t hear this sound .
and in that time they developed these subtle differences in the genetic architecture behind their blindness .
also , i can imagine many design manufacturers will have to retool their own business plans and maybe invest in this kinko &apos;s store . but it really is a big change .
you know , that &apos;s how you do science .
there was no one to comfort me .
they are hospital ships .
and that &apos;s a good thing to measure in m.s. , because patients with m.s. sadly suffer with problems with vision — loss of vision , unclear vision .
and who would want to tax one &apos;s son ?
( laughter ) this formula works wherever metaphor is present .
but i also am in the fueling business .
and i &apos;ll just do that one more time .
now , in non-tech speak , what that basically means is taking big , multi-year projects and breaking them up into bite-sized chunks , so that way we can reduce the risk and actually start to see results every couple of weeks , instead of waiting in a black box for years .
this jump up in energy in 2015 represented the best chance that we as a species had ever had of discovering new particles — new answers to these long-standing questions , because it was almost twice as much energy as we used when we discovered the higgs boson .
you &apos;d be surprised to know that most of the girls that i have spoken to , who did not know about periods at the time of their first menstruation thought that they have got blood cancer and they &apos;re going to die soon .
what are my options ? what choices are now on the table ?
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
and they can pinch them very tight and stop it , or you can have them wide open .
this is a fundamental question that most of us are asking .
i &apos;d watch those same men walking back home every night .
you know where i &apos;m going with that .
but there is one thing i know how to do : i know how to program a computer .
and just this past february , i won two back-to-back world cup gold medals — ( applause ) — which made me the highest ranked adaptive female snowboarder in the world .
as we know , only half the states have opted in .
so we threw in — we created a primordial soup with lots of pieces of robots — with bars , with motors , with neurons .
and fix it .
reputation will be the currency that says that you can trust me .
no one in my family ever had joined the military at all , and how i first got introduced to the military was when i was 13 years old and i got sent away to military school , because my mother had been threatening me with this idea of military school ever since i was eight years old .
but this complement may be much inferior to what , with other laws and institutions , the nature of its soil , climate , and situation might admit of . &quot; &quot; that is so right and so cool .
once you figure this out , you can really impress people at parties .
a hanger .
even the most data-savvy companies get it wrong .
from a few bones , we infer the existence of dinosuars .
and i have four observations i &apos;d like to share with you today .
♫ i believe the almighty knows each and every one of you ♫ ♫ by your name ♫ ♫ women of hope ♫ ♫ women of change ♫ ♫ women of love , joy , no shame ♫ ♫ you &apos;ve got something this little life ♫ ♫ can never take away ♫ ♫ running through the darkness of night ♫ ♫ with a child by her side ♫ ♫ oh lord , won &apos;t you give them ♫ ♫ a shining armor of light ♫ ♫ oh lord , won &apos;t you give them ♫ ♫ a shining armor of light ♫ ♫ daybreak brings a sign of new life ♫
so the idea here is that the ants are working so hard to hang on to the wall or the floor or whatever you call it that they &apos;re less likely to interact , and so the relationship between how crowded they are and how often they meet would be messed up .
we &apos;ve had good enough , really , very powerful effects with kids around the world , and now people of all ages , using hyperscore .
i &apos;ve met a young man in new york whose illiterate mother in a village in senegal takes a bus once a month to the capital city of dakar , just to watch a bollywood movie .
this is what happens when you route these electrical storms to a loudspeaker and you listen to a hundred brain cells firing , your brain will sound like this — my brain , any brain .
working together is what changes our world .
in 1935 , there were 150,000 cases a year of malaria in the united states , but ddt and a massive public health effort managed to squelch it .
we &apos;ve been able to ensure better futures for the people and the bears .
and then i left .
there &apos;s a flip side as well .
but also , there seems to be a complete sort of gridlock in terms of solving these small solutions .
the only way out of poverty is through business enterprise .
we &apos;ve been more successful in the case of drug policy .
they &apos;re reconstructive .
is it because women don &apos;t look like men , they don &apos;t look like that male-pattern heart disease that we &apos;ve spent the last 50 years understanding and getting really good diagnostics and really good therapeutics , and therefore , they &apos;re not recognized for their heart disease .
but go and look at what is in there .
and one of my favorite robots is leonardo .
we &apos;re 25 , 26 years after the advent of the macintosh , which was an astoundingly seminal event in the history of human-machine interface and in computation in general .
( laughter ) who will start me with $ 1,000 ? anyone ?
unfortunately , such emotion-related facial blood flow changes are too subtle to detect by our naked eye .
( applause ) he refused to be provoked by petty grievances .
ec : right , right .
it calls on us to access that which is most universal and most intimate : a love of our brother and our sister and our neighbor .
does it work ? doesn &apos;t it work ? and so on .
and then i said , carry on . carry on . carry on .
well , you should see some kind of two-legged animal here , and then the mirror image of them there .
the more we saturate our culture with public shaming , the more accepted it is , the more we will see behavior like cyberbullying , trolling , some forms of hacking , and online harassment .
we &apos;ll do some side-by-side comparisons here .
i &apos;m not skiing along drawing maps ; everyone knows where the north pole is .
and i thought to myself : what the hell have i done ?
i know you &apos;ve never heard of him , but just mark this day that someday you will hear of him , because he &apos;s really an amazing man . &quot; &quot; frank gehry : i heard he had some kind of a fling with ingrid bergman . is that true ?
i was just always trying to make things .
and these meetings had this effect while taking under 20 minutes .
thank you .
they targeted to universities .
( laughter ) but i think the biggest conceptual pitfall that cybertopians made is when it comes to digital natives , people who have grown up online .
and as we walk in , it is a scene i can only describe you as saying it looked like norway threw up .
( laughter ) so i did the thing .
what is the imagery of god ?
where i couldn &apos;t stop looking .
we repeated the experiment with the same two groups , this time adding a delay between the time we told subjects how we would use their data and the time we actually started answering the questions .
cisgender means the gender i was assigned at birth is still and has always been female .
and it &apos;s fair to say that if we don &apos;t succeed , it &apos;s difficult to see who will .
now that , i would say , is architecture performing .
in 1951 , escher made this drawing . he thought he created an animal fantasy .
if you think 20 percent of genetic information in your nose is a lot of biological dark matter , if we looked at your gut , up to 40 or 50 percent of that information is biological dark matter .
all these choices involve value judgments and social norms , not objective facts .
and i &apos;m your mirror .
it goes into the soil , ending its journey in the lakes , resulting in lakes with extra phosphorus , which leads to the blue algae problem .
so my goal was to overcome the disadvantages of these current treatment methods and create a safe , sustainable , cost-effective and eco-friendly method of purifying water .
and then they would remember the first part of last century , which was really bad , and we could go by this so-called great leap forward .
so i &apos;m here to tell you a story of success from africa .
we could get them .
so the metaphor i &apos;d like the use i can take from a story of a great idea that &apos;s quite recent — a lot more recent than the 1650s .
it was also people &apos;s deep longing for freedom .
i &apos;m going to begin by reciting a poem .
but he was also in oxford in the &apos; 50s , and yet growing up as a child in nigeria , my father used to say to me , &quot; &quot; you must never eat or drink in a yoruba person &apos;s house because they will poison you . &quot; &quot; it makes sense now when i think about it , because if you &apos;d known my father , you would &apos;ve wanted to poison him too .
we wanted to do something now .
we also heard that 250 billion indian rupees was dedicated for government schooling .
i didn &apos;t expect that person that i was going to meet to be him .
js : god knows .
this raises the very real possibility of anonymous war .
the best chess players spend a lot of time not playing games of chess , which would be their performance zone , but trying to predict the moves grand masters made and analyzing them .
but you can see how your people are communicating with each other , what times they call each other , when they go to bed .
extruded typography that &apos;s backlit with neon .
at verdun , in 1916 , over a 300-day period , 700,000 people were killed , so about 2,000 a day .
but lizzie wolf has shown that when we frame our strong emotions as passion , the condemnation of our crying disappears for both men and women .
and i &apos;m also being told that the drum is without snares .
( music ) &#91; basque &#93; ( music ) thank you .
this is a simulation that uses graphics , but other people find motivating what money can buy , not just numbers .
how many children did you have ?
does evolution control the sophistication of matter in the universe ?
i &apos;m in something big , bad and ugly .
and while the hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological dark matter are really only in their infancy , there &apos;s a very , very exciting possibility that exists : that buried in this life , in this genetic information , are signatures of as of yet unidentified life .
but why ?
this solution was initially designed for the chinese market , but now it &apos;s selling like hotcakes in the u.s. and europe , where hospitals are pressured to deliver quality care at lower cost .
now , finning is the act of taking a shark , cutting the valuable fins off and throwing the live animal back in the water .
and then the secretary-general of the united nations came up to speak to god and said , &quot; when will our international institutions work ? &quot;
we don &apos;t want to have what there is in the west .
my dad was a high-ranking gang member who ran the streets .
when i listened to all the stories everywhere i went on the continents , i couldn &apos;t always understand the complicated circumstances of their conflict .
in fact , i think that most of it has to do with body size — the size you are when you inherit a vacant ecospace from whatever natural disaster .
so the adoption papers were signed .
there are the lunch ladies in kentucky who realized that 67 percent of their students relied on those meals every day , and they were going without food over the summer , so they retrofitted a school bus to create a mobile feeding unit , and they traveled around the neighborhoods feedings 500 kids a day during the summer .
now , creative works may indeed be kind of like property , but it &apos;s property that we &apos;re all building on , and creations can only take root and grow once that ground has been prepared .
but if you think about it , if you have a lily pad and it just divided every single day — two , four , eight , 16 — in 15 days you have 32,000 .
and so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in , we can do that .
and if we want to cure ourselves of ndd , or nature deficit disorder , i think this is a great way of doing it .
basically , we tribalize , and that process of unifying feels so good and is so good for us , that it even helps people who are struggling with mental health issues .
i was so lucky to watch the change of that south africa into the new south africa as i went year by year .
that is a &quot; &quot; who is who &quot; &quot; list .
but i think i get to come back to this , because imagine having a compact reactor in a rocket that produces 50 to 100 megawatts .
i was more concerned with touching the screen on my apple than actually feeding him one .
and an ipad .
actually , i read this great quote the other day , which was , &quot; style makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you &apos;re going to die . &quot;
you see , indian music , for example , does not have the concept of harmony .
and that montana is a beautiful place to visit but you do not want to live there , because it is the number one state for suicidal ideation .
so how many other madoffs are there on wall street or in the city of london , fleecing ordinary folk and money laundering ?
in the western world , divorce rates are about 40 percent .
they then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm , which you see here in the picture , put the arm in another room .
and it was — i was following all the rules .
and i noticed that when it was fed up with one petri dish , it would escape and find a better home .
less than one week after , this is a team in eindhoven , it &apos;s a school of engineering .
actually , a building is about the most expensive solution you can think of to almost any given problem .
and there , mr. teszler began all over again and once again achieved immense success , especially after he invented the process for manufacturing a new fabric called double-knit .
all you can do is learn to recognize it and own it .
antonyms , healthy , strong , capable . &quot; &quot; i was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing , it was so ludicrous , but i &apos;d just gotten past &quot; &quot; mangled , &quot; &quot; and my voice broke , and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed .
it involves limited raw materials .
it is the perfect sound for our ears and our brain .
what would they do under the same conditions ?
the feminist revolution still has a long way to go .
and this effect is very pleasant on the mind , and it helps the sentence to feel right .
we make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts .
but it &apos;s not just chinese heroes he cares about .
so it is not at all rational .
before the invention of email , we largely communicated using letters , and the process was quite simple .
how many of you saw a cow crossing in india while you were coming from bangalore to mysore ?
the president of rwanda stepped in and said he would do it .
and all that was cheaper than updating the surrounding sewer infrastructure .
computer programs are essentially trees , and when you make art with a computer program , there &apos;s kind of a problem .
we &apos;ve seen a coercion strategy in which sexual structures are used in a forceful way to basically make a female have sex .
we need to elongate the time frame upon which we judge the balance in our life , but we need to elongate it without falling into the trap of the &quot; &quot; i &apos;ll have a life when i retire , when my kids have left home , when my wife has divorced me , my health is failing , i &apos;ve got no mates or interests left . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) a day is too short ; &quot; &quot; after i retire &quot; &quot; is too long .
enough excuses .
so we just switch off : us , governments and aid agencies .
i &apos;m going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this that we demonstrated in washington . can we look at this thing ?
you may have noticed in the baseball and pizza comparison , under the baseball , it &apos;s all commands .
the computers back up each other . there &apos;s a voting system — if one computer is not agreeing with the other three , it &apos;s kicked out of the system .
what you can see is there &apos;s about six different colors , and each color represents a type of wood to be cut , a piece of wood to be cut .
carved above their door is , &quot; &quot; free to all . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s kind of an inspiring statement , and i &apos;ll go back at the end of this .
that devotion we feel for the national football team .
and i and my colleagues cut into it , and we were able to determine , by looking at lines of arrested growth , some lines in it , that b-rex had died at the age of 16 .
and i was afraid , not for myself , but i was afraid that i was going to lose him , that he was going to sink into one of his states , and that i would ruin his relationship with the violin if i started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy .
and it &apos;s not because people were happy or people were not frustrated .
one of the whitopian outlooks that really hit me was a proverbial saying : &quot; &quot; one black man is a delightful dinner guest ; 50 black men is a ghetto . &quot; &quot; one of the big contexts animating my whitopian journey was the year 2042 .
but primate brains gain neurons without the average neuron becoming any larger , which is a very economical way to add neurons to your brain .
i &apos;m sorry , man . am i freaking you out ?
he was called a &quot; &quot; flaneur , &quot; &quot; one who wanders the arcades .
( laughter ) don &apos;t forget : creativity starts when you cut a zero from your budget .
so , in 1975 , the image there is of typewriters .
he &apos;s definitely the star of my show .
what do we mean by good ?
aquaculture this year , for the first time in history , actually produces more than what we catch from the wild .
but my problem was , i didn &apos;t have the money to pay for them . i couldn &apos;t afford them .
it will just jump , in fact .
they were predominately white .
which is used actually to identify chemical elements in a cool matter , which is absorbing exactly at those frequencies .
they &apos;ve begun to walk in israel and palestine , in jordan , in turkey , in syria .
so try to tell me which child is lying and which child is telling the truth .
and the other remarkable thing is it &apos;s , i think , the highest status of car ownership .
and what that is , is cavitation .
but i had this epiphany .
the residents , after 10 months of peaceful resistance , convinced the israeli government to move the route of the barrier off their lands and to the green line , which is the internationally recognized boundary between israel and the palestinian territories .
but what &apos;s most heartening right now is that despite these challenges , what we &apos;re seeing is that there &apos;s a network of africans all across the continent who are rising up and fighting back and demanding climate justice .
trafficking doesn &apos;t happen in a vacuum .
there was a burning question though that would not leave me .
i know there have been many challenges made to people .
they &apos;re also , number three , the most efficient repairers of fractures that we &apos;ve ever encountered .
our school systems are very flawed and do not reward you for the things that are important in life or for the survival of civilization ; they reward you for a lot of learning and sopping up stuff .
now , many of you have heard the phrase the &quot; &quot; double bind &quot; &quot; and connected it with one thing , and that &apos;s gender .
redwoods grow very slowly in their tops .
so to compensate , i &apos;d hold the pen tighter , and this progressively made the shake worse , so i &apos;d hold the pen tighter still .
but i &apos;m just saying , if y &apos;all are interested in the top five songs , you need to holler at me .
so , birds chirping outside your window may indicate normality , perhaps because , as a species , we &apos;ve been used to that sound every morning for millions of years .
the pilot , i knew , was called troy . i was expecting someone called troy that did this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy .
but it &apos;s also not really enough to just create pockets of walkability .
additionally , it has a profound effect on creative problem-solving and deep information processing .
now , that was the story of me then , my good old days of right-wing lunacy .
but that doesn &apos;t make a lot of sense , does it ?
i had the great privilege , when i was a young lawyer , of meeting rosa parks .
this new york means the same to me as it does to everyone else .
to say ahh , if this happens then we are going to have a pandemic ?
so in space , the earth is very small .
it &apos;s no longer the poorest district , and there is a huge development of biodiversity .
( laughter ) beverly &apos;s clearly one of them , and this little leopard , legadema , is another , and she changed our lives .
now , how is it possible that these forms — they &apos;re wild and radical — how is it possible that they become so ubiquitous throughout the world ?
well , i went to rhode island school of design in the second half of the &apos; 60s to study architecture .
and he picks which joint he wants to move with those chin switches .
that means the playful search for beauty was called the first activity of man .
so , we &apos;ve built this idea of a commons .
( laughter ) we all sit at various places at various times on this scale , but what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us is that if you want mass-market success or mass-market acceptance of an idea , you cannot have it until you achieve this tipping point between 15 and 18 percent market penetration , and then the system tips .
so for example , outreach workers who are distributing condoms to vulnerable populations are not themselves subject to police harassment or abuse or arbitrary arrest .
sl : well , i can understand why you think that people like amy more , and i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s because of your asperger &apos;s syndrome , but being friendly comes easily to amy , whereas i think for you it &apos;s more difficult , but the people who take the time to get to know you love you so much .
and it has to be bi-directional .
the issue isn &apos;t the accuracy of the bombs you have , it &apos;s how you use the bombs you have , and more importantly , whether you ought to use bombs at all .
and what about the second ? what about health ?
we then pull the piles up through the dune and we &apos;re able to create almost any conceivable shape inside of the sand with the sand acting as a mold as we go up .
now i &apos;m going to show you this in 3d .
wait , poor spinal capacity .
and not everybody on death row was a political prisoner .
what i &apos;m most curious about is , how is a species that &apos;s as smart as we are capable of such bad and such consistent errors all the time ?
even though it &apos;s three meters long , it actually , again , eluded science .
i know how to be mowgli .
and it is this very limitation and my desire to connect with people that inspires me as a creator .
so we designed it to have interactive teaching .
khaled was a 29-year-old alexandrian who was killed by police .
that &apos;s a bit long , but it is sort of interesting .
thank you .
in fact , we may have some really interesting bread and beer as we go into this next century .
so the question is : what are we doing ?
you know in 1950 the typical ship carried 5,000 to 10,000 tons worth of goods .
so what about you ?
i &apos;ve been there , actually , many times .
interesting . somebody mentioned 1600 recently .
you express yourself because you have compassion .
so i want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that and then at the end talk a little bit about what some of the implications are for us and for our species , as well as our cultures , because of this change .
you know why i provide kids with those health benefits and the sports and the recreation and the arts ?
because part of kennedy &apos;s vision for the apollo program was that it be a cooperation , not a competition , with the soviets .
now , the first thing that you need to know about designing at scale is that the little things really matter .
but more important we will inspire the next generation of scientists , technologists , engineers and mathematicians .
all peoples are simply cultural options , different visions of life itself .
sometimes , we ask ourselves if we can save the vets .
it shouldn &apos;t take minutes or hours to work .
what he didn &apos;t explain was why the entropy was ever low in the first place .
complexo do alemão has an hdi of .711 .
sure , it is involved in positive emotions like love and compassion , but it &apos;s also involved in tons of other processes , like memory , language , attention , even anger , disgust and pain .
and that anticipation enhances their wellbeing .
we &apos;re more closely related to chimps and bonobos than chimps and bonobos are related to any other primate — gorillas , orangutans , what have you .
in the first volume , swann &apos;s way , the series of books , swann , one of the main characters , is thinking very fondly of his mistress and how great she is in bed , and suddenly , in the course of a few sentences , and these are proustian sentences , so they &apos;re long as rivers , but in the course of a few sentences , he suddenly recoils and he realizes , &quot; &quot; hang on , everything i love about this woman , somebody else would love about this woman .
and it &apos;s important to remember that , because if we don &apos;t , then we become ahistorical .
after much deliberation , the men finally made a decision .
four hundred million dollars , which was real money back in the &apos; 70s .
and long before she was born , i thought about her name , and i was fascinated with a heroic legendary freedom fighter in afghanistan .
and with the kind of computing power we have now , there is , as i say , some of this going on , but it needs money .
and yes , you need to be very careful .
the whole limb extends out . the body flexes backwards — just a spectacular movement .
on the other side , the dose was reduced to 50 percent , and just look at the yield .
i think we agree on that . where does the tree get the stuff that makes up this chair , right ? where does all this stuff come from ?
and it has become a wild success , tapping into the enthusiast photography community .
what adam &apos;s been working on for this last period is not only how to have dan be able easily to make his own pieces , but how he can perform his piece using this kind of personal instrument .
this is a painting by the artist , niki de saint phalle .
this is a picture here taken from spaceshipone .
we tend to constantly ignore public wealth simply because it is in the common wealth , it &apos;s common goods .
in the year she had the jeep , she saved 4,500 girls from being cut .
most people think it &apos;s land mines , but it &apos;s a vehicle accident .
around the world today we &apos;re seeing an incredible transformation , from what i would call a biocidal species , one that — whether we intentionally or unintentionally — have designed our systems to kill life , a lot of the time .
but what we do know is that it isn &apos;t 10 years or 10 billion dollars or a large humanoid robot away .
this last project is also of components .
( clang ) ( laughs ) now obviously , as maddie &apos;s chemistry teacher , i love that she went home and continued to geek out about this kind of ridiculous demonstration that we did in class .
that &apos;s wrong because the theory is quantum mechanical .
and we build buildings of different sizes and styles and different materials , depending on where we are .
( laughter ) before there was data , this was the decision-making device to use . ( laughter )
now raise your hand if any of this is sounding familiar to you , from your part of the world .
it stands guard at the boundary between the known and the unknown , because in order to discover something truly new , at least one of your basic assumptions has to change , and that means that in science , we do something quite heroic .
the woman i thought i was would have said yes .
thank you . thank you . ( applause )
a lot of sexuality education that happens today is so influenced by the baseball model , and it sets up education that can &apos;t help but produce unhealthy sexuality in young people .
it &apos;s a complicated physics problem .
they considered all the usual culprits , and in less than 24 hours , they had selected their suspect : francisco carrillo , a 17-year-old kid who lived about two or three blocks away from where the shooting occurred .
and one of the other things that i said to her through the translator — again , this thing about saying stop — was to not pay attention to me .
so , up until now i &apos;ve been talking to you about really large numbers .
so the lamp is not just giving a light , it &apos;s also giving a darkness .
the kind of question we &apos;re asking is is it possible to build something like google maps of the past ?
so welcome to my home .
but the wind above is from the northeast monsoon .
this new technological revolution is upon us .
i don &apos;t want it to be at moma and possessed by moma .
he played . he won . he played . he won .
now , we &apos;re familiar with all of these models .
my vote won &apos;t count .
when we are in medical school , we learn our anatomy from illustrations such as this where everything &apos;s color-coded .
so as a child , my parents used to drag me to these family events .
and one month ago we have unveiled it .
it &apos;s done by geologists , engineers , biologists , all sorts of different people — modeling and simulation .
that means the host probably stopped listening two minutes ago because he thought of this really clever question , and he was just bound and determined to say that .
we found this leopard in a 2,000-year-old baobab tree in africa , the same tree that we found her mother in and her grandmother .
and this is because one of the things we &apos;ve learned over the last decade of studying market development in africa is that the piecemeal approach does not work .
i &apos;ll just tell you quickly about two stories drawn from recent headlines .
it could be that on one day , the colony is split between two boxes , but on another day , it could be together in a single box , or split between three or more boxes , and that all seems rather erratic , really .
ok now , more importantly , had we been there in the &apos; 40s and &apos; 50s , &apos; 60s , had we seen this disease , had we understood exactly what was going on with it , how might that have changed and completely transformed the nature of the way this pandemic moved ?
and so we met dr. sono khangharani in pakistan .
and the marketing is that not matter how much you &apos;ve invested in your brand , one bad week can undermine decades of good work .
of course , what would we be without computers ?
yeah , it &apos;s very different — no , it &apos;s not different .
now it &apos;s important to understand that this room is cooled by water , heated by water , filters its own water , and it &apos;s powered by water .
hi , elizabeth , i loved your talk .
he came up with a 200-year-old idea called moiré patterns .
start with 10,000 empty boxes and an org chart covering down to every minor city .
she is now an integral member of our family , having been with us since alia was six months old .
( laughter ) and my idea is this — all these men and women should be free to decide whether they do or do not want to conceive a child .
this is allowing them to find the bonding nodes in any lattice of atoms .
( laughter ) now again , we kind of caved in , and we did the very practical approach , which was a bit less awesome .
it said things like , &quot; &quot; in many important ways we are causing real harm to the places we live in , &quot; &quot; and , &quot; &quot; it is essential that we take steps now to prevent further destruction from being done to our earth . &quot; &quot; another group of participants were assigned to read a really different essay that was designed to tap into the conservative value of moral purity .
we were one of the lucky ones to get in the class with the sony cameras and the vista software .
and it takes them about a million years to settle out .
so what we &apos;ve done here is , more or less , a reverse turing test .
a generous mistress whom many loved much .
and as these tectonic plates are spreading apart , magma , lava is coming up and filling those gaps , and you &apos;re looking land — new land — being created right before your eyes .
doing nothing at work is akin to masturbating at work ; it &apos;s totally inappropriate .
and we have a little video that describes the sequence .
there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much .
it was that little outliers there . you see that guy that lived a long time ?
music was once a very physical thing .
seven years ago , an even faster and cheaper american manufacturing technology was used to make this little carbon fiber test part , which doubles as a carbon cap .
and there is as many different kinds of pollen as there are flowering plants .
that &apos;s the idea , and we &apos;re setting this up in the bay area .
and i think that &apos;s symbolic of what we &apos;re seeing in the world in general , that the world is becoming smaller and smaller , and that all of the peoples in the world are enjoying more opportunities for connection .
he &apos;s another young designer from france who &apos;s working — and at this point he &apos;s working , also , with pharmaceutical companies — on new ways to engage patients , especially children , in taking their medicines with constancy and with certainty .
our group , palliative care , in 2012 , working with the sickest of the sick — cancer , heart disease , lung disease , renal disease , dementia — how did we improve patient experience ?
so this is a picture of birds generated entirely by a neural network that was trained to recognize birds , just by solving for x rather than solving for y , and doing that iteratively .
for a data scientist that just happened to go to space camp as a kid , it just doesn &apos;t get much better than that .
now , the great news about all this , and we have a ton of work left to do , and we have a lot of culture to change , but the great news about all of it is that we know it works .
i don &apos;t there &apos;s anyone in this room who &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; well , the right way to start would be , let &apos;s make a great seat belt for adults .
and it &apos;s very common that we compare india with china .
they need to be part of the pack .
so ballroom dancing , implicit versus explicit — very important .
and they made it into a toy , and then they dropped it like a hot rock .
the click is the modern triumphal clarion proceeding us through life , announcing our entry into every lightless room .
he &apos;s developed a very avant-garde cuisine .
and there he was .
but the single biggest lesson we learned is to reverse the waterfall as much as possible .
so i went back to the store and said to the owner , &quot; i love the shoes , but i hate the laces . &quot;
for me , air is plural .
( music ) ( applause ) talking about geometry and everything , if you take the circle and you split it in half — can you run &quot; &quot; s-curve music ? &quot; &quot; i &apos;m going to do just a short version of it .
so i think we need a deeper understanding of how people , money , power , religion , culture , technology interact to change the map of the world .
but it &apos;s a question of how tortuous this path is from those frail beginnings , those seeds , all the way to life .
so our legislators cannot analyze the budget that they are voting for .
i mentioned that to miguel , and he nodded .
we can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything .
after that experience , i changed .
of course i can . and they &apos;d enjoy it immensely ; i see them standing around right now , everywhere .
we have 14 out of the 21 degrees of freedom ; you don &apos;t need the ones in the last two fingers .
and i couldn &apos;t help notice that the people who were perpetrating the appalling atrocities , the paramilitary organizations , were actually the same people running the organized criminal syndicates .
and , if that wasn &apos;t bad enough , of course , all of this is rapidly progressing towards the fact that many of you , in fact , about one in 10 of you at this point , will die in intensive care .
if you &apos;re an american , for example , you &apos;ve probably traveled in france .
it &apos;s a bee that , yes , flies .
you know , the repairability issue is a cooperation problem .
a network is not just the product of its component parts .
it means that the economy is dividing into high-skill , high-wage jobs and low-skill , low-wage jobs — and that the middle , the middle-skill jobs , and the middle-earning jobs , are starting to drop out of the economy .
these are volcanic stones laid by hand .
now there is much to gain and benefit from this massive analysis of personal information , or big data , but there are also complex tradeoffs that come from giving away our privacy .
the more people who know about this technology , the more we can all have a voice in how it &apos;s being used .
i used them for describing some of the aspects of the complexity of nature .
it had a revolutionary prosthetic fitment and delivery system , a quick molding and modular components , enabling custom-made , on-the-spot limb fitments .
this is a graph of autism prevalence estimates rising over time .
and the idea was the relationship of the space , which was made up of the fold of the image , and the dialectic or the conflict between the figuration , and the clarity of the image and the complexity of the space , which were in dialog .
i mean , that would take more teachers than we &apos;ve ever had .
in short , we &apos;re using data to make novel sockets quickly and cheaply .
we can insist that all people have the opportunity to learn about contraceptives and have access to the full variety of methods .
and he got me a super 8 camera when i was 10 years old .
months later , maybe about two months later , i started about getting my job back , which is something , when you become this primary caregiver person , which some people in the audience here have certainly been in that position , it &apos;s a challenging role but at some point you &apos;ve got to figure out when you &apos;re going to get your life back , and at the time , i couldn &apos;t ask gabby if she wanted me to go fly in the space shuttle again .
this shift is the most striking in the u.s. and in the u.k. , but it &apos;s a global phenomenon .
obviously it was shown , and it was amazing .
this is a campaign done by a young artist in new york , who calls himself &quot; &quot; true . &quot; &quot; everybody who has ridden the new york subway system will be familiar with these signs ?
but we &apos;d also see something very , very surprising .
i might not be your typical person you find on this stage .
i set it up with the foreman . i set it up with the owner of the land .
so our first critical moment , it &apos;s open .
major moves , outside of our equatorial homeland , from africa into other parts of the old world , and most recently , into the new world .
you can just change a couple of the dna strands in this binary representation and you &apos;ll get 96 rather than 32 .
international organizations , non-governmental organizations , private voluntary organizations , contractors .
but where ?
with , you know , of course , there &apos;s the gravity brain .
thank you .
years later , someone commented that my writing had a rhythm to it .
the self changed , got affected , broken , destroyed , but another one would evolve — sometimes stronger , sometimes hateful , sometimes not wanting to be there at all .
no 10-year-old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions .
i want to conclude .
i &apos;ve been on a team that won the world championship of barbecue .
we can do the same for geothermal energy and solar power .
caroline thought he was marginalizing half of humanity .
&quot; foreign aid is the most aid to poor people , &quot; is about the most home-biased thing you can find .
it was very hard to calculate from first principles . i was stumped .
ten of diamonds .
you &apos;re on coke . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) &quot; &quot; you moved to new york with an mba , one clean suit , and an extremely firm handshake . you &apos;re on coke . &quot; &quot; ( laughter )
patient : their shapes ...
we wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from .
now , that &apos;s great , except we had him at age 44 .
i &apos;m a himba .
ok , it &apos;s time to kick some ass .
it &apos;s just that being a human , the way we train to perceive the reality creates this meaning .
and , in exchange for me working with them , they taught me how to be cool .
this is where we need to make our voices heard .
and many , many people wanted to join us , because you don &apos;t go into this kind of work to manage a system , you go in because you can and you want to make a difference .
i broke it into a top tier and a second tier of points , and i ranked everything starting at 100 and going all the way down to 91 , and listing things like i was looking for somebody who was really smart , who would challenge and stimulate me , and balancing that with a second tier and a second set of points .
and then literally , you now pour on a monomer .
i said , &quot; &quot; how much is it worth ? &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; we will start with smaller quantity , &quot; &quot; — i was like , aww — and then he said , &quot; &quot; of 25 kgs . ( laughter )
going blind taught me to live my life eyes wide open .
the other way that they are better is actually being able to resolve different levels of gray .
here &apos;s the overall picture .
people always ask , &quot; &quot; did you find the right ship ? &quot; &quot; it said yorktown on the stern .
so we didn &apos;t know what to do , but we decided to cast a very wide net .
when you look at the biggest user and the second largest user , we use 20 million barrels and the chinese use 10 .
or do you know if he is intoxicated or anything ?
at this point , she &apos;d rowed over 200,000 strokes , fighting the current and the wind .
or it could be your mom .
( laughter ) i do not subscribe to crochet today ! magazine , although it looks delightful . ( laughter ) take note of those clock ends .
i hope you &apos;ll all wear them .
that &apos;s me and my son on the floor .
i &apos;m a writer . i imagine . i make stuff up for a living .
we started asking manufacturers what were in their materials .
( laughter ) and i am right there on the edge , which i &apos;ll tell you about , another story .
so in judaism , we have , from our torah , that you should love your neighbor as you love yourself .
here we go .
in fact , we &apos;re separated by 95 million years of divergent evolution .
it turns out it &apos;s not rocket science to design a sacred space .
but if we want to look at the sky and see predictions , we still can .
so here &apos;s a general rule of thumb that i believe in : when societies have strong institutions , the difference that one good leader can make is limited , but when you have weak institutions , then just one good leader can make or break that country .
so , one of the reasons it &apos;s so challenging to prepare for this y2k problem is , i want to argue , we have what i would call mainframe poisoning .
we found one of the single most powerful gene-editing instruments , crispr , inside yogurt .
i spent months in hollywood learning 3d animation software , and i spend months on each animation , and that &apos;s just time that most researchers can &apos;t afford .
are you with child ?
and i said , &quot; &quot; sir , i do . &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; so do i. &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; when i leave office , i &apos;m going to spend my time writing a book on why jesus christ rose again , and why it &apos;s so important to believe that . &quot; &quot; in one of his plays , alexander solzhenitsyn depicts a man dying , who says to those gathered around his bed , &quot; &quot; the moment when it &apos;s terrible to feel regret is when one is dying . &quot; &quot; how should one live in order not to feel regret when one is dying ?
we can &apos;t settle for that , which is why the concern about the eighth goal , which relates to funding , which i said at the beginning is falling , is so troubling .
it &apos;s also carried on migration patterns of wild migratory aquatic birds .
because i think it &apos;s an urgent question .
and that &apos;s the way it is with definitions of words .
and i would imagine that a lot of you have too .
they give me , i don &apos;t know , a sense of correctness in the world and some visual delight in the knowledge that the building will probably never look as good as this simple industrial scaffolding that is there to serve .
and the last one is destructive attacks , and those are the ones that concern me the most .
simply put , when the impulse is to change the world , the academy is more likely to engender a learned helplessness than to create a sense of empowerment .
just complete domination .
but that was my first real experience as a solo singer-songwriter .
you may have worried that you ate carbs after 7pm last night , and that you really should renew your gym membership .
so i was trained as a historian .
it &apos;s two people dropping the pretense of being know-it-alls .
the first , to my mind , is what i call as &quot; &quot; the ideas that have arrived . &quot; &quot; these ideas have brought together something which has made india happen the way it is today .
but what i &apos;ve come to learn is that the world is never saved in grand messianic gestures , but in the simple accumulation of gentle , soft , almost invisible acts of compassion , everyday acts of compassion .
so we met in november 2002 , and aicha will now tell you how that came about .
for all the names i &apos;ll never know , say her name .
when we say of somebody that he &apos;s &quot; &quot; in it for the money , &quot; &quot; we are not just being descriptive .
the other thing that &apos;s also interesting that &apos;s going on here is the fact that intelligence agencies — and it doesn &apos;t matter who they are — they all operate in an industry where their commodity is information , or restricted access to information .
so jains are not supposed to eat meat .
that &apos;s the principle objective .
we &apos;re down to one and half right now .
the wall that kept me , elyn , professor saks , separate from that insane woman hospitalized years past , lay smashed and in ruins . &quot; &quot; everything about this illness says i shouldn &apos;t be here , but i am . and i am , i think , for three reasons : first , i &apos;ve had excellent treatment .
fg : because i want to get a standing ovation like everybody , so ...
because if you double one percent seven more times , which is exactly what happened , you get 100 percent . and the project was finished on time .
it tells a story . the story can reach into obscure desires .
we were going to exist . here &apos;s another one .
crispr is going to be amazing , in terms of the number of different scientific advances that it &apos;s going to catalyze .
this was reinforced by the political climate of the time .
i &apos;m going to think about it in 3d space . so now , instead of it just being a letter that &apos;s in front of me , it &apos;s a space that my body can go inside of .
so in a yin-yang way , silence needs loudness and loudness needs silence for either of them to have any effect .
we symmetrize the face , and we run our algorithm .
but i was committed to making sure that i could do anything possible to make her stay more comfortable . i brought her a warm blanket and a cup of a coffee .
so hopefully tomorrow i ’ ll show one or two more objects from the stage , but for today i just wanted to say thank you for all the people that came and talked to us about it .
and this person is particularly interesting .
in contrast , in traditional societies without writing , older people are the repositories of information .
the u.s. news &amp; world report ranks colleges just as the consumer report rates washing machines .
i don &apos;t know how to prevent that , but i &apos;m at least going to use my good offices to get you folks together to come up with a response . &quot; &quot; so they formed a white house task force , and they spent about three years arguing about who takes how much responsibility in the global supply chain .
first of all , you have to edit ruthlessly .
so if you look at this , you might immediately grasp that different people have different numbers of connections .
( applause ) we &apos;re delighted about it as well .
and that &apos;ll make such a huge difference on the system , because the amount of waiting time and the amount of distances that people need to travel , often sometimes seven to 15 kilometers , sometimes by foot , to get a simple health check done , is very , very detrimental in the sense that it really dissuades people from getting access to health care .
but mucus is actually very important .
and then we had some hint that these things existed all along the axis of it , because if you &apos;ve got volcanism , water &apos;s going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor , come in contact with magma , and come shooting out hot .
this year &apos;s swine flu strain grew very poorly in early production : basically .6 doses per egg .
i need a hundred billion . &quot; &quot; so i &apos;m like that .
we won &apos;t bring anything with us .
how does life make things ?
so what do you think happens to these gals ?
it has led me to further my research and to use it as a model for my laboratory research .
( applause ) thank you very much . ( applause )
we need to learn from those figures that i mentioned .
i talk about race and this question of whether we deserve to kill .
well , there are steps we can take to navigate our way through the morass .
those combinations yield very much more than the sum of the parts , especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities .
for a two-year-old , that is like a tattoo . ( laughter ) you know ? you only get one birthday per year .
as the sign said back there , &quot; &quot; without limitations . &quot; &quot; they knew no other way to live than to follow their dreams .
in this case , supply right next to demand .
( chomping ) ( drum roll ) ( toilet flushing ) okay . next to the pitch region is another set of regions that are selectively responsive when you hear the sounds of speech .
( laughter ) but sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that .
that chin barbel is flashing .
he had three or four friends with him , and he does that , and they all look , and there was no infection , and they bend over me and they &apos;re poking and prodding , and they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; there &apos;s no hematomas , blah blah , look at the color , &quot; &quot; and they &apos;re talking amongst themselves and i &apos;m , like , this restored automobile that he &apos;s just going , &quot; &quot; yeah , i did that . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and it was just , it was amazing , because these guys are high-fiving him over how good i turned out , you know ? ( laughter ) and it &apos;s my zipper , and i &apos;ve still got the staples in and everything . and
how is that possible ? let &apos;s go to something else .
simplicity is a neat word . and you &apos;ve got to think about what simplicity means .
this does not mean that it &apos;s the final solution , or that this even provides permanent protection .
no , it matters quite a bit , and i &apos;ll give you an example of why .
here you see actually how the damage appears in this material .
a terrific use of local materials , but inside you could find some interior compositions .
i started improv everywhere about 10 years ago when i moved to new york city with an interest in acting and comedy .
and this idea , again , came from the grassroots , from two googlers who wrote their own job descriptions and volunteered themselves for the job .
and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i &apos;ve been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me .
my accent with english improved a lot .
behind the destruction , i found a soul of places .
the goal of spacex is to try to advance rocket technology , and in particular to try to crack a problem that i think is vital for humanity to become a space-faring civilization , which is to have a rapidly and fully reusable rocket .
it &apos;s very , very , very detailed inside with the design .
there &apos;s a growing extremism that comes from both sides in this debate , in response to this conflict between the law and the use of these technologies .
there are some creatures on this planet already that don &apos;t really do aging .
but this time , the migration leaves african-americans in place , as families and businesses flee the city , leaving the city pretty desolate of people as well as jobs .
now xu and i , on the other hand , were in a completely windowless black room not making any ocular movement that even remotely resembles an eye blink because our eyes were fixed onto a computer screen .
it &apos;s actually not limited to films .
so we said , there &apos;s just got to be a better way to do this .
now , if violence is re-concentrating geographically , it &apos;s also being reconfigured to the world &apos;s new topography , because when it comes to cities , the world ain &apos;t flat , like thomas friedman likes to say .
but i don &apos;t want you in the frame , i don &apos;t want you in the window , i want you through the window , i want you on the other side , in the world , inhabiting the world .
the bigger the crowd , the more potential innovators there are .
we can never go back to a place and find it exactly where we left it .
one of the reasons , i think , is a sort of boiled frog phenomenon .
now , let &apos;s put aside the online anonymous sex chatrooms , which i &apos;m sure none of you have been in .
and before long , in some months , raisuddin was that olive garden &apos;s highest grossing alcohol pusher .
let &apos;s look at a country like india .
so this story is the first of 18 chapters in my new body of work titled &quot; &quot; a living man declared dead and other chapters . &quot; &quot; and for this work , i traveled around the world over a four-year period researching and recording bloodlines and their related stories .
i &apos;ll follow her advice . i &apos;ll stop talking .
i photograph from a fixed vantage point , and i never move .
there &apos;s several examples up on the screen of situations where doctors are looking to implant devices inside of people , and all of these devices now , it &apos;s standard that they communicate wirelessly , and i think this is great , but without a full understanding of trustworthy computing , and without understanding what attackers can do and the security risks from the beginning , there &apos;s a lot of danger in this .
once you start down at this very humble level , then you can start finding ways to see things .
and that is a room that was built for a woman named nancy wilson , who recorded that album at our school last christmas .
and the way to ask that question is to look at the neanderthal that comes from southern europe and compare it to genomes of people who live today .
molas are infamous for carrying tons of parasites .
i mean , we &apos;re not putting this one back .
i went down there in the winter time .
the second thing you need is light .
no , it doesn &apos;t mean that at all .
anybody do any writing today ? did anybody write a word ?
so that when we begin to grapple with the ideas of artificial intelligence in the future , we shouldn &apos;t only be asking ourselves , &quot; can we build it ? &quot;
but there is a problem with that view .
it went up to 49 .
naela ayyash , who strived to build a self-sufficient palestinian economy by encouraging women in gaza to grow vegetables in their backyards , an activity deemed illegal by the israeli authorities at that time ; rabeha diab , who took over decision-making authority for the entire uprising when the men who had been running it were deported ; fatima al jaafari , who swallowed leaflets containing the uprising &apos;s directives in order to spread them across the territories without getting caught ; and zahira kamal , who ensured the longevity of the uprising by leading an organization that went from 25 women to 3,000 in a single year .
well it turns out that the computer analogy is just as valid for emotion .
the right of peoples to live together in the same state , worshiping differently , freely — a middle east , a world , in which religion is not the subject of division or of debate .
but i had no idea what the context was or what that even , what it even meant to the people who heard it .
1998 : a single mother of four , three months after the birth of my fourth child , i went to do a job as a research assistant .
combining the live play and the serialization of written fiction , you get this new format .
they &apos;re going at a meter a second . how many think the one on the left is running up the wall ?
we have complete control over his blush responses , the diameter of his nostrils to denote stress .
em : it must , actually . if it doesn &apos;t , we &apos;re in deep trouble .
&quot; i feel very lonely . &quot;
this is the view looking down the hudson river , with manhattan on the left , and new jersey out on the right , looking out toward the atlantic ocean .
( audience : five of clubs . ) lg : pardon ? ( audience : five of clubs . ) lg : five of clubs . it &apos;s not the same person , even if it &apos;s the same spot .
because the real peak is hidden around the corner .
the six-year-old is in a car seat , and it turns out that looks terrible , but that &apos;s great . that &apos;s like a 400 , ok ?
&quot; &quot; to say that something is essential is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the achievement of a certain object .
so i like to invent things too , and i think i &apos;ll close out my set with something i invented a good while back .
so one of the big bellwethers , and one of my final points i want to mention , is the interesting thing i read is that cnbc has launched their first african channel . why is cnbc doing this ?
we get one child like that about every classroom of 30 kids who will actually cut straight to the chase .
but we are indeed heading for a major crisis , and i ’ d like people to become aware of this problem .
everyone on the team knew that i have a wife and two small children — 10 and 15 — and i wanted to come back safely .
and the whole series of work came out of it .
very quickly , i felt like i didn &apos;t belong .
what we rarely do is ask refugees what they want , where they want to go , but i &apos;d argue we can do that and still make everyone better off .
the second is that traditional charity and aid are never going to solve the problems of poverty .
and he had a very large head , which she thought might indicate hydrocephalus .
we extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy is up here .
he &apos;s a man , a servant , an older servant looking at this younger servant , saying , &quot; &quot; look at me . i want to warn you about what you &apos;re about to go through . please look at me . &quot; &quot; and he never does .
and so this allows for a controlled delivery of drugs and for reintegration in the environment in all of these formats that you &apos;ve seen .
now , there &apos;s good news and bad news about this corruption .
so for this reason , i think one of the other themes with the mesh is essentially that , if we squeeze hard on things that we &apos;ve thrown away , there &apos;s a lot of value in those things .
and if you look through the eye , or you look at the vessels on the white of the eye , in fact , you may be able to do this directly , without drawing any blood at all , or through your nail beds .
and so , what we found out was that , if you take animals that are animated like you and i , and you make them cold — that is , these were the garden worms — now they &apos;re dead .
they say , &quot; &quot; how dare you take this child out of the house and terrify other people .
it &apos;s a complete denial of mistakes .
basically , a human body is a conversation going on , both within the cells and between the cells , and they &apos;re telling each other to grow and to die , and when you &apos;re sick , something &apos;s gone wrong with that conversation .
because i think it &apos;s not just a cultural space or housing ; there has to be the recreation of an economic core .
here are some fun images . here &apos;s burt rutan and my good friend greg meronek inside a zero gravity — people think a zero gravity room , there &apos;s a switch on there that turns it off — but it &apos;s actually parabolic flight of an airplane .
( applause ) danit peleg : rebecca is wearing one of my five outfits .
and you just never know who is going to take something from that and turn it into something else , because inspiration is cross-pollinating .
these girls are also working in big construction companies like ram-ki construction , as masons , full-time masons .
the whole cementation process takes about 24 hours .
i got the chinese line .
zk : it &apos;s steve . all right steve , now , follow me .
mom was a nurse &apos;s aid .
the hyena is the ancestor of the horse because it was part of a production called &quot; &quot; faustus in africa , &quot; &quot; a handspring production from 1995 , where it had to play draughts with helen of troy .
( laughter ) people have used it to magnify pulsing veins in their hands .
but , if we put money into the core budget , we know that there aren &apos;t the budget systems with integrity that mean that money will be well spent .
our borrowing costs were skyrocketing , and we were facing possible default .
and the red cross too is training volunteers and twitter is certifying them , not simply to supplement existing government institutions , but in many cases , to replace them .
and he &apos;ll do that hundreds and hundreds of times .
it &apos;s not about selling soap , it &apos;s about making sure that in the process of doing so you can change people &apos;s lives .
she was actually coming out of an amnesty international meeting . ( laughter )
mri is using magnetic fields and radio frequencies to scan the brain , or any part of the body .
and he also told me about young japanese-americans during the second world war .
you know , we can make ozone from car tailpipes .
but if there &apos;s a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there , and you make them small enough , and we won &apos;t see them either . that is true .
in fact , you can &apos;t even take the name of the country for granted , because the name &quot; &quot; india &quot; &quot; comes from the river indus , which flows in pakistan .
but i do have to be concerned with those things .
( digital hum and whistling sound ) the ( whistles ) is frogs at home , don &apos;t pay attention to that .
in tuscaloosa , at the university of alabama , there &apos;s an organization on campus called , kind of menacingly , the machine , and it draws from largely white sororities and fraternities on campus , and for decades , the machine has dominated student government elections .
what do you think that fan &apos;s experience is going to be when we take the video footage of an adrian peterson bursting through the line , shedding a tackler with a stiff-arm before sprinting in for a touchdown ? what do you think that fan &apos;s experience
and don &apos;t console yourself that you are the 99 percent .
and the supreme court justices wrestled with that question .
as leah , one of the founders of the group , says , &quot; &quot; i like traditional music very much .
and i said , &quot; &quot; you know what ? these apples come from your ancestors , and your ancestors gave them the greatest honor they could give them .
and that gets you all the scientific data that goes with it .
and dysphoria refers to a feeling of agitation or unease .
they want a say in decisions that are made in their name and with their money . it &apos;s this democratization of information that i think is an information enlightenment , and it has many of the same principles of the first enlightenment .
twelve years ago , i was a fresh graduate seeking my way in the world .
there are very few young infants because they die — high mortality rate — and there &apos;s very few old people .
over 20,000 economists whose job it is , competitive entry to get there , couldn &apos;t see what was happening .
i want to do that too — &quot; &quot; oh ! oh ! &quot; &quot; and all of that .
if in the islamic revolution , the images of the woman portrayed were submissive and didn &apos;t have a voice , now we saw a new idea of feminism in the streets of tehran — women who were educated , forward thinking , non-traditional , sexually open , fearless and seriously feminist .
cp : i stuck that thread so it lasted a few days .
so we &apos;ll release the findings this september for the first time , and then next year , we &apos;ll poll again , and we &apos;ll take the additive step this time of ranking the 1,000 largest u.s. companies from number one to number 1,000 and everything in between .
child : there is no difference here between classes , nor white or black , nor if you have money or not .
( laughter ) and then there are others that are about people .
he said , ok , we &apos;re going to start having these meetings .
but in order to sustain the horizontal line — because these are the projects , these are the systems that we will deliver — we need to also develop the vertical line : system sustenance , high-level education , research and development , industries , technologies , to produce these technologies for application , and finally markets .
and we can &apos;t keep cutting down rain forests for it .
in the process of becoming a supernova , the interior of the star collapses under its own weight and it starts rotating ever faster , like an ice skater when pulling their arms in close to their body .
( applause ) thank you .
but also here is another idea we have — is an intercollegiate exchange program where you have students going from new york abroad .
the stasi also shadowed tens of thousands of people using specially trained agents and secret cameras to document every step one took .
hala simply could no longer cope .
now , it &apos;s not that chemicals are not important in psychiatric disorders .
and i hope you all take part .
and addressing these non-obvious core issues became a key part of the program .
right here , in my city of rio , in spite of mandatory voting , almost 30 percent of the voting population chose to either annul their votes or stay home and pay a fine in the last mayoral elections .
or do i smell some doubt in the room ?
number two , there &apos;s power in promiscuous thinking .
i think they are a cancer of the soul .
it &apos;s a lobster made of playdough that &apos;s afraid of the dark .
we &apos;re seeing them in the beaufort sea , floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out .
and this omission , he said , led to seeing people , and people starting to see themselves , within the categories of the bureaucracies and the institutions .
other outcomes include long-term stalking , even after the abuser remarries ; denial of financial resources ; and manipulation of the family court system to terrify the victim and her children , who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend unsupervised time with the man who beat their mother .
is being more sustainble what gives you a higher quality of life ?
♫ to keep on giving ♫ ♫ and forgiving ♫ ♫ aung san suu kyi ♫ ♫ living under house arrest ♫ ♫ for her peaceful protest ♫ ♫ under house arrest ♫ ♫ for her peaceful protest ♫ ♫ when her people asked her for a message ♫ ♫ she said ♫ ♫ if you &apos;re feeling helpless ♫ ♫ help someone ♫ ♫ if you &apos;re feeling helpless ♫ ♫ help someone ♫ ♫ if you &apos;re feeling helpless ♫ ♫ help someone ♫ ♫ if you &apos;re feeling helpless ♫ ♫ help someone ♫ now we know the words , let &apos;s sing . ♫ if you &apos;re feeling helpless ♫ ♫ help someone ♫ ♫ if you &apos;re feeling helpless ♫ ♫ help someone ♫ ♫ if you &apos;re feeling helpless ♫ ♫ help someone ♫ ♫ if you &apos;re feeling helpless ♫ ♫ help someone ♫
so as is the case with simple solutions , oftentimes the answer is right in front of your face , and for us it was levers .
but go on a bit further up the curve , and then we see it flattening out .
you need proteins for muscles , recovery .
the plant also gets smaller .
how many digits are there in your number ?
by doing these kinds of simulations , we want to eradicate or control malaria thousands of times in software before we actually have to do it in real life ; to be able to simulate both the economic trade-offs — how many bed nets versus how much spraying ? — or the social trade-offs — what happens if unrest breaks out ?
by the 1950s , we started connecting all the towns together with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world , the highway system .
because people used to sew and they needed a pin cushion .
i &apos;m not going to talk about that tonight .
so in fact , something we realized , we can &apos;t just use the web , we have to worry about what the underlying infrastructure of the whole thing , is it in fact of a quality that we need ?
so the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires and then your team wins .
and they further learn this through the lack of teachers that look like them .
and the gm kid is swinging higher , they look better , they &apos;re a better student , they don &apos;t have that stuffy nose you need to wipe .
so if , in fact , you want to live a life free of regret , there is an option open to you .
i wrote my book , &quot; &quot; our final century , &quot; &quot; as a scientist , just a general scientist . but there &apos;s one respect , i think , in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective , and that &apos;s that it offers an awareness of the immense future .
imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole .
at that age , obviously , i couldn &apos;t express it that way , but i told her i didn &apos;t feel right .
given that it was such a vast civilization , you might expect to find really powerful rulers , kings , and huge monuments glorifying these powerful kings .
take a look at the death rate from breast cancer over time .
so here we have alice in green and bob in red .
this is her cooking teacher .
some of their cases are questionable and some involve threats and violence .
in a way , the static , stone mountain becomes a moving mountain of sand .
so here &apos;s an example of that , also from andrew &apos;s machine learning class .
ec : ... when i was growing up in the &apos; 90s .
some believe that traveling between the two towers will lead you to another dimension — this bridge has been romanticized as such — that the fall from that frees you from all your worries and grief , and the waters below will cleanse your soul .
yeah . i think it &apos;s evolutionary .
but for many years , until the late 1990s , china had an infrastructure disadvantage vis-a-vis india .
i was on academic and disciplinary probation before i hit double digits , and i first felt handcuffs on my wrists when i was 11 years old .
but responses can actually make a huge difference in the poor countries . this is a proposal that has been talked about a lot in europe .
each of them can make changes and they can merge them after the fact even if they didn &apos;t know of each other &apos;s existence beforehand .
eventually , after a period of six months of brutal war and a toll rate of almost 50,000 dead , we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant .
the hum of the engine died .
lc : oh definitely , definitely . i mean , you know , it was interesting , because i spent basically two years hanging out in this city , dongguan , and over that time , you could see immense change in every person &apos;s life : upward , downward , sideways , but generally upward .
and this hasn &apos;t just happened .
it &apos;s just a set of choices that people make .
we need to have black and white and asian and hispanic just to step forward and say , &quot; we are not going to accept that kind of behavior anymore . &quot;
the last piece of the puzzle is understanding how that code controls your battery .
curiosity has also drilled in that red soil and brought up other material .
in winter , exactly the opposite is happening .
he &apos;s trying to determine if where he is on a bit of long now land would appear from down in the valley to be the actual peak of the mountain .
and you are going to have corresponding abnormal neurology .
there were just bad for me .
paradise on earth , again .
hands up if you think poem 2 was written by a human .
and i even loved seeing behind her ; i could see the little teddy bear sitting on the piano behind her in her room .
similarly , when i have an experience that i describe as a lion or a steak , i &apos;m interacting with reality , but that reality is not a lion or a steak .
here &apos;s clive sinclair now launching his color computer .
then i had video projectors that were projecting intermittently onto the spheres .
( laughter ) and you have to say this room hadn &apos;t been tidied up since 1888 .
but our attempts at doing this are crude and blundering compared to the fine-grained specificity of the parasites .
funds for education , for training and for rehabilitation are declining , so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues .
this is a video editing application where all of the controls for manipulating the video are physical .
people bring their own cooker , he attaches a valve and a steam pipe , and now he gives you espresso coffee . ( laughter ) now , this is a real , affordable coffee percolator that works on gas .
there &apos;s a p.r. company called edelman , they do this very interesting survey every year precisely around trust and what people are thinking .
so , zipcar is a company that i founded seven years ago , but it &apos;s an example of something called car sharing .
no sooner was it proposed than reformers in nigeria adopted it , pushed it and published the revenues in the paper .
no one &apos;s really going to bother you . &quot; &quot; so one of the things that i do is i actually look through my server logs very carefully .
you know , in every culture , shamans have been using environments as medicines .
we sit here — you know , think about the ground vehicles , the human scale — what do you see in person ? we need to capture that up close to establish that what it &apos;s like-type experience .
but as i was moving away from the traditional classical repertoire and trying to find new ways of musical expression , i realized that with today &apos;s technological resources , there &apos;s no reason to limit what can be produced at one time from a single string instrument .
your data looks at fatalities . it doesn &apos;t look at serious injury .
and their politics are not entirely unattractive .
most people use chemical fertilizers . but guess what ?
maybe just a little .
now , we cannot achieve perfection , but if we reach for it , then we can achieve excellence .
and i had to overcome my fear of deep water to find this one .
( laughter ) but michael — he puts it off .
he did this in his phd for hundreds of pairs of drugs .
how many people here would say you &apos;re a maker , if you raise your hand ?
whereas the future self wants the present self to save .
i saw a company that had taken seawater and sand , and they were growing a kind of crop that will grow on pure salt water without having to treat it .
when i first heard from ted and chris a few months ago about the possibility of the prize , i was completely floored .
a woman told me , &quot; &quot; when i see a nollywood film , i can relax , i really — i can breathe better . &quot; &quot; there is also another very important thing that i hope will resonate with this audience .
take a skin cell , make it a master pluripotent cell , so you could then make those cells that are relevant to their disease , both to study but potentially to treat .
but this is what helped me see it .
and this brings me to another favorite of mine — i think , because it is just so unusual .
and we can store information that &apos;s film with water and protein .
you have changed the microclimate .
jake barton : so i have to say i did not actually choose those individual samples to make you cry because they all make you cry .
man : some type of extension pole — like what the painters use .
milo : i just really miss my old house , that &apos;s all .
she started crying . she asked me to call her back .
lp : well , i think invention is not enough .
so what if we &apos;re fighting the wrong war , fighting obesity rather than insulin resistance ?
the system is so healthy , it purifies the water .
they got out on the far end , we said , &quot; &quot; fine , don &apos;t worry about it . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s transparent . a certain amount of certainty gives the sense of a non-zero outcome .
( applause ) so amanda , would you please tell us how you lost your arm ?
and as an economist , we can also look at that side of the story .
america still hated the bear and feared it , but all of a sudden , america also wanted to give the bear a great big hug .
incidentally , we see just one octave .
how do we go from the metaphor to something more practical that we can really use every day ?
so what does this personal health system look like , and what new technologies and roles is it going to entail ?
that makes it easier to imagine trading places with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration to that other person .
well now there are potentials of this building to allow the artistic director to actually move into the building without using our architecture .
i care about it deeply .
he thought , &quot; &quot; oh , i can renovate the school .
and i went . i hadn &apos;t bathed in three days .
and this is even more dangerous — well , it &apos;s dangerous again .
so what kind of hormones are these ?
if you flush a toilet , your feces will go to the sewage treatment plants , which are sold as assets , not liabilities .
we have reason to be afraid of melting ice caps .
so we will absorb technology as part of us .
it surrounds us all the time , just like the air we breathe in this room .
well , giving your voice can change lives .
52 million people die of natural causes each year corresponds , then , to 52 million volumes destroyed .
in my lab in princeton , we bring people to the fmri scanner and we scan their brains while they are either telling or listening to real-life stories .
now , i think it &apos;s fair to say that when people think about state and local economic development , they don &apos;t generally think first about what they &apos;re doing about childcare and early childhood programs .
maybe it &apos;s called ego .
and some of the watches there , attempting to be beautiful and humorous — maybe not attempting , hopefully succeeding .
today we have choices .
so , what do we do ?
here &apos;s the way i like to describe it instead .
i don &apos;t want to advertise them too much ; that &apos;s not the point .
murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling .
for example , you can use the verb &quot; &quot; go &quot; &quot; and the prepositions &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; in a literal , spatial sense .
&quot; &quot; the worlds are the important thing .
so i like the way you roll , sergey brin . no .
meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink .
for all that it is raising hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in the emerging markets , it &apos;s also outsourcing a lot of jobs from the developed western economies .
they recommended that she do some therapy , but after a while she wasn &apos;t feeling better , so the doctors decided to do further tests .
and so i began my quest to find out how i can learn how to weave .
this is a training ground to sort out the regulars from the honors , a reoccurring cycle built to recycle the trash of this system .
the first question is a tortuous path from geology up to rna or something like that — how did that all work ?
this report is our main public report .
this has never been seen before .
the problem is not technology .
this is how i &apos;ve started to think , and this is certainly how i &apos;ve been thinking in the last few months as i &apos;ve been working on the book that will soon be published , as the dangerously , frighteningly over-anticipated follow up to my freakish success .
i started sketching out these plans to make a photo , and i sent it to the wildlife biologist down in okeechobee — this is an endangered bird , so it takes special permission to do .
history was real , cultures were real , but countries were invented .
we have historical records that allow us to know how the ancient greeks dressed , how they lived , how they fought ...
i wasn &apos;t able to portray his story from within , and so i began to search for a new visual language , one which strived to express the ephemeral quality of his spiritual experience .
he &apos;s sitting there .
( laughter ) this is one substitution that i believe all of us , in design management , are guilty of .
so i went into the woods .
how much do i stand to gain from cheating ?
now , it works just like a regular phone .
so you &apos;re going to be able to go like this . ( laughter )

but on the edge of town , one elderly lady , a charwoman in the charnel ground , saw a jeweled foot on a jeweled lotus on his shoulder and then the dog , but she saw the jewel foot of the maitreya , and she offered a flower .
i need people to understand what the reality in the west bank looks like .
and when we calculated we thought we &apos;re never going to make it around the world at that speed .
you will not play at the casino with the resources that people have entrusted you with .
america today is a sprightly young body , hit by one of those strokes that sucks the life from one side , while leaving the other worryingly perfect .
think about that &apos;s where we are right now , and the curve that we &apos;re on means that this is going to continue to get better .
well linguistic scripts can actually encode multiple languages .
just right , you &apos;re creative , and yet you don &apos;t fall for too much baloney .
we have a dentist — she &apos;s a grandmother , illiterate , who &apos;s a dentist .
the problem is that current prosthetics don &apos;t work very well . they &apos;re still very limited in the vision that they can provide .
and that refers to feeding information into the brain via unusual sensory channels , and the brain just figures out what to do with it .
you can buy cuecas baratas , designer underwear that isn &apos;t really manufactured by a designer , and even pirated evangelical mixtapes . ( laughter ) now , businesses tend to complain about this , and their , they , i don &apos;t want to take away from their entire validity of complaining about it , but i did ask a major sneaker manufacturer earlier this year what they thought about piracy , and they told me , &quot; &quot; well , you can &apos;t quote me on this , because if you quote me on this , i have to kill you , &quot; &quot; but they use piracy as market research .
thank you so much .
so maybe we could activate or inactive memories by just using light — xl : that &apos;s pretty fast .
so i would urge you to really learn about these types of technologies , because , really , only in that way are we going to be able to guide the development of these technologies , the use of these technologies and make sure that , in the end , it &apos;s a positive outcome — for both the planet and for us .
you see , he has established the largest retail chain , called big bazaar .
in the 1970s , the turnover of the red brigades on a yearly basis was seven million dollars .
i remembered an old man yelling to us and crying to help us get him up .
here i have a very complicated , messy , confused idea in my head .
so i was positive that , if somehow we can make things mimic life , let &apos;s go one step further .
we talk about what still has to get done , what &apos;s so critical to get done in the lab .
now , in lebanon , we have one refugee per three lebanese .
they &apos;ll be able to focus their hearing , they &apos;ll be able to increase the sensitivity , decrease the sensitivity , do a series of things that we can &apos;t do .
you may not come near me !
and he died when the ambulance was coming to the hospital to take him .
several people heard about this story , and so they contacted me because they wanted to pay the $ 2,500 debt .
search out the companies that are acting on this .
but in all seriousness , because this idea is birthed in ted , i would like it to be a legacy of ted , and i &apos;d like to call it the &quot; &quot; international system for total early disease detection . &quot; &quot; &#91; instedd &#93; and instedd then becomes our mantra .
this is my last map .
as difficult as it is to see , homo sapiens , that is humans , evolves every day , and still continues to evolve .
and i of course knew stuff , as a designer , about typography , even though we worked with those animals not so successfully .
but for that , we already have the training manuals , which are approved by the ministry and moreover , this approach is now part of the mental health strategy in afghanistan .
for strength and lightness , the dome structure used five rings of coffers , each of diminishing size , which imparts a dramatic forced perspective to the design .
which was three minutes longer than i had prepared .
robotics systems are just incredible these days , absolutely incredible .
and actually , our political beliefs also can affect the way we see other people , including politicians .
violated by this conductor again ?
their involvement reduces the cost .
last year at ted i gave an introduction to the lhc .
people will see my tag , and they &apos;ll see &quot; &quot; the war tapes , &quot; &quot; and then we &apos;ll start talking about war .
what if obesity isn &apos;t the cause of insulin resistance at all ?
this is another subject that comes in place , and this is a prediction .
pm : and when you arrived at the hospital , what was the prognosis that they gave you about gabby &apos;s condition and what recovery , if any , you could expect ?
this pill also — millions of people have taken it , the company did studies , the fda looked at it — all good .
and i said , &quot; &quot; oh . &quot; &quot; because those had been in the news lately .
a somatic cell , a body cell , was taken from its body , gestated in the ovum of a cow , and then that cow gave birth to a guar .
now , i don &apos;t know exactly where it &apos;s going , but i &apos;ve got a bit of effort involved in this thing .
but obviously , there wasn &apos;t a lot i could do about it .
it hurts me , too .
it &apos;s the president of harvard . it &apos;s 1871 .
and that &apos;s the ability to exploit opposing ideas and opposing constraints to create new solutions .
but if that &apos;s it and that becomes the reason that renewables don &apos;t get invested in , then , long-term , we &apos;re screwed anyway , right ?
helping africa is noble .
i buried some of our new vehicle engines , i buried it to save it .
we can run the score up against anybody , and then get our asses kicked in the second half — what they call fourth generation warfare .
and everything looks normal except the children &apos;s faces .
so does that mean we have nothing to worry about ?
to get rid of nuclear weapons and to end the supply of the materials required to produce them , some experts tell me would take 30 years .
national rating at that time , national rating , the aids and the tuberculosis &#91; rating &#93; , was always on the top 10 list for zip codes for cities across the nation , or just zip codes across the nation .
the bad news is that &apos;s not true .
now , obviously i can &apos;t do all of them , so a few highlights for you : the highest ranked g7 country is canada .
( laughter ) you know that all of the cool people are — they &apos;re doing it .
this child matters .
you &apos;ll find out why it &apos;s called a bristlecone pine . a little sensory experience .
and what i &apos;ve found is that the process of designing and building electronics is problematic in all sorts of ways .
would they give me academic journals so i could scribble in the margins ?
the recent wars in iraq and afghanistan have produced , thank god , a casualty rate about one third of what it was in vietnam .
but back then , we noticed that detail and we fixed it , and now everyone else does that as well .
now , we basically have to change our views slightly .
and so , to my great surprise , i found that going nowhere was at least as exciting as going to tibet or to cuba .
so if you were thinking of buying an ipad , forget about it . this is what you want instead .
the majority of our functional brain is distributed over the outer surface layer of the brain , and to increase the area that &apos;s available for mental capacity , the brain surface is highly folded .
warren berger says that design thinking teaches us to look sideways , to reframe , to refine , to experiment and , probably most importantly , ask those stupid questions .
and then the skin — the edges of this — all promote the dynamic , the movement of the building as a series of seismic shifts , geologic shifts . right ?
it is ourselves we are helping .
this is now the largest crowd-funded science project that we know of — over 8,000 people have signed up at this point .
i couldn &apos;t understand the starvation , the destruction , the killing of innocent people .
actually , i &apos;m even here speaking as a middle class white man .
so last october , in gentleman scholar tradition , i put the entire collection online as &quot; &quot; museum of four in the morning . &quot; &quot; you can click on that red &quot; &quot; refresh &quot; &quot; button .
so let &apos;s look at this ceiling and see storytelling gone global .
the doors can actually swap out , so you can actually put on a rigid panel with a window unit in it for climate control , or a connector module that would allow you to actually connect multiple units together , which gives you larger and kind of compartmentalized living spaces , so now this same kit of parts , this same unit can actually serve as a living room , bedroom or bathroom , or an office , a living space and secure storage .
and that was to recognize that when you sit around the table , the actual location of the people becomes rather important .
so last year , on the fourth of july , experiments at the large hadron collider discovered the higgs boson .
but he &apos;s an absolute genius when it comes to design .
on the weekend , your choice .
my phone is a slot machine .
we &apos;re looking for images that shine an uncompromising light on crucial issues , images that transcend borders , that transcend religions , images that provoke us to step up and do something — in other words , to act .
and the scarcity of resources for dealing with these problems is only growing , certainly in the advanced world today , with all the fiscal problems we face .
it pours out millions of gallons every hour , and supplies drinking water to at least 300 million people , and washes many , many babies , and of course feeds many , many animals , both domestic and wild , produces thousands of tons of rice .
it starts of with the very small ones , which are one carbon , four hydrogen — that &apos;s methane — it just floats off .
social relations and exchange become significantly more important than they ever were as an economic phenomenon . in some contexts , it &apos;s even more efficient because of the quality of the information , the ability to find the best person , the lower transaction costs . it &apos;s sustainable and growing fast .
and something about it just kind of drew me towards it .
we were surrounded by thousands of acres of cotton fields .
it &apos;s titled , &quot; &quot; an american index of the hidden and unfamiliar , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s comprised of nearly 70 images .
my early canvases ended up being things that you wouldn &apos;t expect to be used as canvas , like fried food .
so what is the air ?
the rules are like the notes on the page , and that gets you started , but then you dance around the notes on the page , coming up with just the right combination for this particular moment with this particular set of fellow players .
well you might have , but i don &apos;t think so .
i &apos;m not supposed to care when black youth are harassed by police , because my white-looking jewish kids probably won &apos;t ever get pulled over for the crime of driving while black .
in fact , one of the things that i did just for amusement purposes is we can now write things in this code .
now i have done the impossible not once , but many times .
and this is a completely different song .
we think a lot of good can come from this technology .
it &apos;s kind of a well-kept secret .
we need to stop shouting and start talking .
let me quickly give you three examples of startups that personally inspire me .
it &apos;s actually emitting ultrasound — low-level ultrasound — that &apos;s about 100,000 vibrations per second .
now harry butler , who most australians would know is a famous naturalist , had spent a lot of time in the marine environment .
the people who received this message showed a marked decrease in energy consumption simply by being told what their neighbors were doing .
for so many years we have fed on aid .
this man was in an ngo feeding center , being helped as much as he could be helped .
but the point is that when i was first in gombe in 1960 — i remember so well , so vividly , as though it was yesterday — the first time , when i was going through the vegetation , the chimpanzees were still running away from me , for the most part , although some were a little bit acclimatized — and i saw this dark shape , hunched over a termite mound , and i peered with my binoculars .
and tennis is global .
we don &apos;t talk about that as men .
so he &apos;s really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today .
and in subsequent climbs they could never find that ant again , and so no specimens have ever been collected .
they are often the precursor to bigger things .
what are we to do ? we are faced with a paradox .
but the age of empires is gone .
i see it everywhere .
and so it is not any one stripe or something that tells me i have a virus of a particular type here ; it &apos;s the barcode that in bulk represents the whole thing .
and he was kept there by the owner &apos;s calm insistence .
above 50,000 feet you need a space suit , a pressure suit .
the picture behind me was snapped by the copilot in our chase aircraft just moments after the wheels got off the ground for the first time .
but at the same time , it &apos;s my responsibility to teach a large course to undergraduates on the brain , and that &apos;s a big subject , and it takes quite a while to organize that , and it &apos;s quite challenging and it &apos;s quite interesting , but i have to say , it &apos;s not so exhilarating .
if you live up here , in summer the sun is coming fairly directly down , but in winter it &apos;s coming through a huge amount of atmosphere , and much of the ultraviolet is weeded out , and the range of wavelengths that hit the earth are different from summer to winter .
the other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently when you have very few ophthalmologists ?
and that urbanization is extraordinary , accelerated pace .
here we are . unfortunately , i can &apos;t show you a picture of this symmetrical object .
and the third is the focusing illusion , and it &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about any circumstance that affects well-being without distorting its importance .
i want to talk to you about one of the biggest myths in medicine , and that is the idea that all we need are more medical breakthroughs and then all of our problems will be solved .
this is a real challenge to do this , because animals , when you start to really look inside them — how they work — appear hopelessly complex . there &apos;s no detailed history of the design plans , you can &apos;t go look it up anywhere .
this is probably a fairly small piece of mathematica code that &apos;s able to be run here .
bruce bueno de mesquita : i &apos;ve thought about that , and since i &apos;ve done a lot of work for the intelligence community , they &apos;ve also pondered that .
when i first realized that we had no option as scientists but to use much-vilified livestock to address climate change and desertification , i was faced with a real dilemma .
there is some danger , there is some trap . one trap : the vertical .
it is unimaginably small .
so it turns out there &apos;s a keyboard shortcut that lets you jump directly to the beep like this .
i don &apos;t really see it , i don &apos;t pay attention to it until there &apos;s , you know , like a bug that &apos;s dead on the window .
thank you very much .
i want to stay out of the way .
and it got worse , not better .
and yet , i would like to think that i am more than my genes .
if you look at most of the world &apos;s major religions , you will find seekers — moses , jesus , buddha , muhammad — seekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness , where they then have profound epiphanies and revelations that they then bring back to the rest of the community .
what i &apos;ve shown you here is sometimes called a major transition in evolutionary history .
and you &apos;re still learning who you are .
sp : but can reason lead us in directions that are good or decent or moral ?
and it &apos;s a great thing actually that nobody &apos;s had to think about it here today because it means that we can take this for granted .
here &apos;s a time lapse of one of the time-lapse units being made .
what will that lead to ?
( video ) dr. jason topping : my name is jason topping .
so i approached my phd supervisor , professor rachel calam , with the idea of using my academic skills to make some change in the real world .
you get an algorithm that you can program in a binary code , and that &apos;s the defining trait of the computer program .
we dropped them gently in .
here we go .
so nowadays , everyone could produce his mono product .
and here is my beloved briefcase , also rescued from that morning .
it &apos;s very difficult to be healthy on a planet where we &apos;ve poisoned the earth and the sea and the air .
and that was no coincidence .
with aculab and patientslikeme , we &apos;re aiming to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals .
the staircase takes us from the experience of life as profane or ordinary upwards to the experience of life as sacred , or deeply interconnected .
now here &apos;s a conference in which people talk about the future , and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000 .
i mean , all of the ballroom dance geeking out that we had always done on why salsa worked differently than the competitive rumba and why tango traveled unlike the waltz , all of that just hit the public consciousness , and it changed everything .
now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid .
it gets even worse than that . let me just walk you through this one .
these guys are all shrinking , the power is all drifting out here , so the outcome is going to be the weapons-grade fuel .
and that &apos;s what you see in the last rose bowl , you know , when we entered one of the floats .
and that &apos;s important for many fronts , and one of them is because of that culture that &apos;s in agriculture .
but in the 1970s , the energy crisis struck , and customers started thinking about how to save energy .
let me turn the trails on , so you can see that a little bit better .
deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes , those brain cells die , they never come back .
the solidarity of millions of yemenis across the country just demanding the one thing .
so this photograph was taken last month by ryan with an iphone .
we could understand it here , though .
yeah , good .
paul ? come on , stand up .
it &apos;s more profound than that .
so there &apos;s about 86 billion neurons in our brain .
and what he showed me and what he can show all of us , i think , is that the great thing for chefs , the great blessing for chefs , and for people that care about food and cooking , is that the most ecological choice for food is also the most ethical choice for food .
in 1998 , the people of indonesia took to the streets and overthrew their longtime dictator , suharto .
( laughter ) ( applause ) now , in three short years , we &apos;ve come a long way with stand-up comedy shows happening even in saudi arabia .
at these large-scale construction sites in china , you see a sort of makeshift camp where workers live during the entire building process .
anyway , so the biggest thing that &apos;s invisible to us is what we don &apos;t know .
then i saw our chancellor coming to school in denims and turtlenecks , and thought , it &apos;s not right for me to keep this other &#91; rule &#93; so i let them just — they had to be neat and clean .
and i want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands , great mothers , friends , daughters , sons .
and what happened next was that i entered this state of pure , unprejudiced amazement .
video : don blankenship : let me be clear about it . al gore , nancy pelosi , harry reid , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations .
well , actually , it is .
and we built a probability map of where they might have been .
and because it &apos;s easy for the buyer to change allegiance whenever they want , the only way of trusting a vendor is if they have a good history of positive feedback from other users of the site .
so the temperature required for fusion is 150 billion degrees c.
that was a big deal ; that was important . he worked for kodak for a while ; that was important .
this often creates a good cop / bad cop dynamic in which the copy editor — i &apos;ll use that as an umbrella term — is invariably the bad cop .
main result is that there is tremendous confusion .
well , not exactly everyone , because the u.s. intelligence only has a legal right to monitor foreigners .
when i was just about to give everything up after years of suffering , i started to rediscover the true power of music .
what they haven &apos;t been so good about instructing people is the problem of darkly pigmented people living in high latitude areas , or working inside all the time .
essilor stays ahead of its game , and has delivered spectacular performance for over 40 years , by using the principles of prudence and adaptation .
a poetic image for a story on tolstoy , by sam abell .
right now , we don &apos;t really have a bead on that .
( laughter ) but the truth is that i had a very happy childhood , full of laughter and love , in a very close-knit family .
they &apos;re easy , they &apos;re cheap , because instead of making places , we &apos;re making memories of places .
so it can actually hold itself in very strong currents , as you see here .
we got a lot of people thinking about electric cars , what you could do with them . a few years later , when we suggested to gm that now is the time and we could do a thing called the impact , they sponsored it , and here &apos;s the impact that we developed with them on their programs . this is the demonstrator . and they put huge effort into turning it into a commercial product .
and she &apos;s just turned 18 .
thelma nichols : inmate number 0b2472 .
the head nurse told me proudly , &quot; you see , our children are very well-behaved . &quot;
so this is how you create intimacy .
if we obey these laws , we can do amazing things .
now , things — i &apos;m making this sound very easy , this is actually a lot of work .
unfortunately , many of us in this room are supporters of capitalist policies and market forces .
( applause ) and what i &apos;ve shown you today is only the beginning .
it might not make any sense to you if you haven &apos;t seen it before .
he &apos;s coming up to one of my graduate students and flipper patting , which he would do to a female penguin .
and then i pasted huge posters everywhere in the bourgeois area of paris with the name , age , even building number of these guys .
i had nothing to offer and no one had anything to offer me .
if you were not , you maybe had to go through an operator .
now it turns out , in the mathematics , you can put it in as a term that &apos;s an energy , but it &apos;s a completely different type of energy from anything we &apos;ve ever seen before .
that so many of the city &apos;s most venerable taxpayers have survived yet another commercial building boom , is cause for celebration .
he &apos;d be torn apart by the bitter divisiveness of sectarianism .
and we just put these two together in the same system .
but what are you going to do with a flat track pad , those square things ?
it &apos;s a beard trimmer , you see ?
now , i know that &apos;s a dirty word for some people , but we evolved from common ancestors with the gorillas , the chimpanzee and also the bonobos .
he said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot; &quot; and i have to tell you , it was energizing .
but if you consider the green part of the brain stem , nothing like that happens .
so , i started collecting found objects .
but why are there so many orphans in europe when there hasn &apos;t been a great deal of war or disaster in recent years ?
it &apos;s not an equally great answer and my reply to that is usually , &quot; &quot; try to google the word &apos; search engine , &apos; you may find a couple of interesting alternatives . &quot; &quot; and last but not least , thirdly , inevitably , one student will raise her or his hand and say , &quot; with google , i &apos;m certain to always get the best , unbiased search result . &quot;
what is the real thing that you should be afraid of ?
i learned very few things in addition since ( laughter ) — but made a whole number of them into projects since .
these are the 15 commodities that fundamentally pose the biggest threats to these places because of deforestation , soil loss , water use , pesticide use , over-fishing , etc .
with this factory and 100,000 planes a year , we could make all of america &apos;s electricity in about 10 years .
the ability to make and test models has become essential , not only to every single area of science today , but also to modern society itself .
we happened to win , just recently , the green product of the year for &quot; &quot; the re-invention of drywall , &quot; &quot; from popular science .
it &apos;s the essence of the design process .
but the one thing that i always looked forward to was playing around with my cousins .
again , not a single one of them — i think there are about seven or eight of them — thought this would do any good . they thought this was a temporary change .
but that didn &apos;t happen .
so , solving the problem of pollution with more pollution .
in other words , we &apos;re raising our girls to be perfect , and we &apos;re raising our boys to be brave .
this is dave clearing the airspace with the faa for 15 miles .
and if we really want to get out of this economic mess , if we really want high performance on those definitional tasks of the 21st century , the solution is not to do more of the wrong things , to entice people with a sweeter carrot , or threaten them with a sharper stick .
but it changes fundamentally our governance and management paradigm , from the current linear , command and control thinking , looking at efficiencies and optimization towards a much more flexible , a much more adaptive approach , where we recognize that redundancy , both in social and environmental systems , is key to be able to deal with a turbulent era of global change .
and it &apos;s that choice that i want to focus on , because as we migrate lethal decision-making from humans to software , we risk not only taking the humanity out of war , but also changing our social landscape entirely , far from the battlefield .
another example is a group of designers who were working on a surgical instrument with some surgeons .
all right . very good . about half .
so — and that &apos;s a song about how everybody &apos;s miserable because , you know , we &apos;re from russia .
i have to tell it , because there was no one to put two and two together .

this is scary because when the economy doesn &apos;t grow , our children don &apos;t get better lives .
we can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours .
many barriers are breaking down .
actually no generator is 24 / 7 . they all break .
i know how it can look really bad .
he told me to stop , take my backpack off and put my hands on the police car parked next to us .
i was here , planting my chunks , cutting up potatoes and planting it , and the bees were working on this tree ; bumblebees , just making this thing vibrate .
and you can show , just by looking at data from literature , that vector-borne diseases are more harmful than non-vector-borne diseases .
it wasn &apos;t until i entered high school that i thought , &quot; &quot; maybe now , you know — being a big high school kid — i can maybe become an active part of this big medical world . &quot; &quot; i was 14 , and i emailed professors at the local university to see if maybe i could go work in their lab . and hardly anyone responded .
we don &apos;t like to give up our special-ness , so , you know , having the idea that robots could really have emotions , or that robots could be living creatures — i think is going to be hard for us to accept .
and he turned to my mother , and he said , &quot; &quot; you haven &apos;t told her yet ? &quot; &quot; on my seventeenth birthday , as janis ian would best say , i learned the truth at 17 .
his photo was remembered by all of us .
so because of having cooked food , it &apos;s easier to digest .
we have zero infrastructure .
i &apos;ve been temporarily detained .
now just like the physical maps of our world that have been highly influenced by technology — think google maps , think gps — the same thing is happening for brain mapping through transformation .
so there &apos;s something about aging that &apos;s kind of universal .
aerial images could also be processed to produce three-dimensional computer models of forests .
but anyway , the cops down at the precinct charged chuck with receiving stolen property .
we see rocks .
you &apos;ve got to think , and i &apos;m going to ask you some questions .
to understand even something as important to us as happiness , you kind of have to branch off in all these different directions , and there &apos;s nowhere that i &apos;ve discovered — other than ted — where you can ask that many questions in that many different directions .
edward snowden shined a light on an important need that people had to understand .
and even stranger , there were these people , these beekeepers , that loved their bees like they were family , and when i put down the book , i knew i had to see this for myself .
another world is possible .
so some solutions to heat can provide for win-win-wins .
i had a rigorous scientific transect .
gas is a similar issue . gas is also a biological product . and as you think of gas , well , you &apos;re familiar with gas . and here &apos;s a different way of mining coal .
the object itself just means nothing .
and sure enough , if you sit down , and you analyze all this data on spaghetti sauce , you realize that all americans fall into one of three groups .
all the little details — the curb return radius .
( applause ) increasingly in developed countries , women are socialized to believe that our place is no longer only in the home , but men are actually still where they always were .
he reached down . he pulled a lever . and the chair sank down .
now , a lot of parents , when they adopt , actually want to erase their children &apos;s history .
in brazil , they are usually first sent to governmental triage facilities , in which most of the cases , the conditions are as bad as with the traffickers .
seven to one is the ratio , they tend to say .
one way of describing the plutocrats is as alpha geeks , and they are people who are acutely aware of how important highly sophisticated analytical and quantitative skills are in today &apos;s economy .
so why does good sex so often fade ?
we really are seeing the dawn of interventional surgery .
so combine those with the adventurous outliers from new generations of locally trained architects and designers and engineers , and always remember that you are designing for curving , tapering , hollow poles .
so — ( laughter ) i announced what we were going to do in a broadcast interview , and straightaway , the emails started coming .
a team of doctors in europe published a series of papers about colonoscopies .
say a new super bug has emerged .
i also started looking around in the city and trying to photograph them .
i believe that is what is happening .
and as we watch it , we are ashamed .
that &apos;s where those big peaks are over to the left .
but with this in mind , we organized this expedition , which was the closest civilians have been to the nuclear power plant .
one advantage of that is that you can allocate money coherently .
we have a responsibility to try .

or , even better , let &apos;s just take people right out of the emergency room — undefined , community-acquired respiratory tract infections .
do you want to come over and listen ? &quot; &quot; and i &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; yes , ma &apos;am , i do . &quot; &quot; and she &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; well what are you going to do when you get here ? &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot; &quot; and i &apos;d go over there and i would , i would just listen .
now , when your state is collapsing , your economy is heading south at a rate of knots , the last people you want coming on to the labor market are 14,000 men and women whose chief skills are surveillance , are smuggling , building underground networks and killing people .
by the way , speaking of the filing system , it never occurred to us that these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network .
and they &apos;re learning to become like us .
i mean , that &apos;s 2005 figures .
so in order to ask evolutionary questions , we need to know about reproductive success .
it &apos;s difficult because it &apos;s a very experiential medium .
( applause ) chris anderson : really powerfully argued .
the single story creates stereotypes , and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue , but that they are incomplete .
trade and industry takes 43 billion .
in philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program , so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday , taking them home , getting access to information .
based on the other images we have , i &apos;m really happy how it looks today .
and at this rate at which we are losing fish , it is a human problem of enormous dimensions , a health problem of a kind we haven &apos;t seen before .
when i wrote my report to the koreans , i said , &quot; &quot; look , i don &apos;t know what this guy was doing , &quot; &quot; but my guess was interacting with his mother or his girlfriend .
because , you know , it &apos;s great for us , but bad for humans .
and i remember watching my family go through that and thinking that i never wanted another family to feel that kind of loss .
hence my motto : green is the new red , white and blue . &quot; &quot; and i asked myself , in a way , looking back , &quot; when did that kind of awareness of the planet and its fragility first appear ? &quot;
last year , i was in nairobi , in the slums , in one called korogocho — which literally means when translated , &quot; &quot; standing shoulder to shoulder . &quot; &quot; and i spoke with this women &apos;s group that &apos;s pictured here .
lastly i want to say that all of you , probably , have had some relationship at some time in your life with a dog , a cat , some sort of pet , and you recognized that those are individuals .
i &apos;m going to give you four specific examples , i &apos;m going to cover at the end about how a company called silk tripled their sales ; how an artist named jeff koons went from being a nobody to making a whole bunch of money and having a lot of impact ; to how frank gehry redefined what it meant to be an architect .
it &apos;s usually some kind of choice between the vocational and the intellectual .
you &apos;d probably kick me out , or something .
so we actually started with a number of volunteers who helped us in seattle , just over a year ago , to tag what they were throwing away — different types of things , as you can see here — things they would throw away anyway .
but how could we show these teeny-weeny things ?
and this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play .
and in that moment , i started this journey .
ca : thank you for scaring the living daylights out of us . thank you , ralph .
in many theme parks , you can pay extra to jump to the head of the line .
unfortunately , over the past quarter century , epidemic obesity has made our two-ton steel cars gain weight twice as fast as we have .
and now it &apos;s a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for .
so a lot of your vision — the bulk of it is visual , and it &apos;s pouring in .
your job is only to be human .
and we recruited wonderful staff , highly motivated staff .
before you breed .
we opened the gates for higher education for every qualified student .
or this could represent a college green .
it &apos;s &apos; technology , entertainment and design . &apos; &quot; &quot; and she said , &quot; &quot; well , you design a story when you make it up , it &apos;s entertainment when you tell it , and you &apos;re going to use a microphone . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) i said , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re a peach , ma . pop there ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s the matter ? the pearls of wisdom leaping from my lips like lemmings is no good for you ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) then my pop got on there .
it &apos;s a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits , because it &apos;s always still plastic .
because of the speed and brevity of social media , we are forced to jump to conclusions and write sharp opinions in 140 characters about complex world affairs .
and here &apos;s the thing that you need to get comfortable with when you &apos;ve given the tool to acquire information to students , is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process .
in the past , different students were taught in similar ways .
so now i want to take you to the moment of — when you &apos;re an entrepreneur , and you &apos;ve started a new company , there &apos;s the , here &apos;s all the stuff we do beforehand , and then the service launches . what happens ?
it would be a crime for all of us not to be aware when somebody shows up at a swimming pool and says one word , just one word , if you don &apos;t listen if that word is &quot; &quot; lifecode . &quot; &quot; thank you very much .
and then he went to the top-most peak of the greatest mountain of the center of the world called meru .
here &apos;s an example .
but if we &apos;re already invoking aliens in this explanation , then who is to say they didn &apos;t efficiently clean up all this mess for recycling purposes ?
but i do think we &apos;re going to figure it out eventually .
so , a moment .
if there was a dial tone and you dialed a number , the odds were two in three you wouldn &apos;t get the number you were intending to reach .
he is not a political man , but in this guise he has given us the institution for democracy , from where we can rise .
that &apos;s 40 billion dollars a year wasted on electricity that does not contribute to our well-being but does contribute to climate change .
we &apos;ll see what i come up with . thanks for having me .
so there really was no tolerable margin of error .
this is the opposite of what we were built on : independence , self-sufficiency , autonomy .
and as the student video showed , we can impact and move .
you know , you guys are so great , you don &apos;t even know what a connectome is , and you &apos;re willing to play along with me .
metaphorical thinking is essential to how we understand ourselves and others , how we communicate , learn , discover and invent .
and this sort of data explosion available from these is really almost becoming a challenge .
and i think we are not really being honest about that , for so many reasons . it &apos;s so hard to talk about gender .
a brewery is essentially a bioreactor .
and on the bottom-left is a thermal camera .
they have similar sound of eyes .
trying to find a space suit to do this has led me to an area of technology that i never really expected when i set about doing this .
we end up in the situation — we have that scripted life that everybody seems to be living going up this ladder to nowhere .
it &apos;s about your own interpretation and doing something different . &quot; &quot; and i like that .
and with the known physics etc , it &apos;s something actually which has been pointed out by frank drake , many years ago , and shklovsky .
and the second world war was really a terrible event , also economically for japan .
it &apos;s great to let go .
and usually they are accompanied by videos .
the athletes &apos; bodies have gotten much more different from one another .
bringing people , future generations , together through arabic calligraphy is what i do .
it doesn &apos;t mean that at all . it doesn &apos;t ensure it .
dh : could you spread your legs a little bit ?
we know that when it comes to choosing somebody for a job , for an award , we are strongly biased by their race , we are biased by their gender , we are biased by how attractive they are , and sometimes we might say , &quot; &quot; well fine , that &apos;s the way it should be . &quot; &quot; but other times we say , &quot; &quot; this is wrong . &quot; &quot; and so to combat this , we don &apos;t just try harder , but rather what we do is we set up situations where these other sources of information can &apos;t bias us , which is why many orchestras audition musicians behind screens , so the only information they have
what you have here seems to be nothing , but contains an incredible amount of scientific information that helps us explore what makes us human .
mohammed lost both legs during the last week of the conflict .
the fall of the berlin wall would maybe not &#91; have been &#93; there .
he served 24 years for a crime he didn &apos;t commit .
they would offer sweets or money .
so , almost anywhere i went , there they were .
we &apos;re ok , though ? kt : yes .
but the idea has a merit . the idea has a merit .
the amount of energy in each cubic centimeter remains the same , even as the universe gets bigger and bigger .
we &apos;re not doing a great job managing money .
and a little bit later , they were joking around in the kitchen in spanish , that had nothing to do with me , and that is duality .
and so i went back to the united nations .
and it worked .
when those extra three billion people &apos;s identity is mobile , it isn &apos;t fixed ?
the chimps are actually interacting with each other through the computers .
e : what &apos;s the matter ?
but it matters a lot how fast we win it .
so i took another crack at it — you &apos;ve got to keep it moving — and i xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper and i pasted them down on an ugly board .
ernest madu : the lesson in this is that it can be done , and it can be sustained , and you can make it possible for everyone .
moderator : wow . okay , that &apos;s where we are going .
and then when they get old , they haven &apos;t really developed a philosophy of life , but they &apos;ve decided , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve been successful at everything ; i &apos;m just not going to die . &quot; &quot; and so they hire personal trainers ; they &apos;re popping cialis like breath mints .
well let &apos;s take a look at something like autism incidence per thousand .
this may sound a bit kooky to you .
and it also enhances nuclear weapons proliferation .
and this outer layer , this is the vasculature , which is incredible , around a human brain .
but over the centuries , we have constructed on top of this objective reality a second layer of fictional reality , a reality made of fictional entities , like nations , like gods , like money , like corporations .
what are you in america doing about it ?
but i find that with my job , that the rewards far outweigh the risks , and as many risks as i take , my clients take far greater risks , because they have a lot more to lose if their cases go unheard , or worse , if they &apos;re penalized for having me as their lawyer .
so this is not by accident that the voters are not interested to vote anymore .
this is emblematic of it — this is wing dining , recalling those balmy summer days somewhere over france in the 20s , dining on the wing of a plane . you can &apos;t see it very well here , but that &apos;s hemingway reading some pages from his new novel to fitzgerald and ford madox ford until the slipstream blows him away .
was that essential to sort of maintain the quality of what was being built ?
this is the sensory part of the program , people .
it &apos;s a sense of privilege that the natural universe doesn &apos;t share .
this is actually something that one of our engineers , dom , built in a weekend .
it &apos;s no small thing to change a prison system .
i &apos;m not an anthropologist , i have no technical study with the subject , but i do have a very , very , very deep passion , and i believe that i had to choose the most beautiful people on the planet in the most beautiful environment that they lived in , and put the two together and present them to you .
my sweet angels , come back . &quot; &quot; medea she was , next time i saw her .
you &apos;d all make great blind people . ( laughter ) let &apos;s have a look at what can happen when this activation process is given some time and attention .
and this is called &quot; &quot; the wilderness downtown . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s an online music video for the arcade fire .
and when i got out of my car , the air was pulsing .
well , dickens was right and he was wrong . &#91; correction : rudyard kipling &#93; &#91; kipling &#93; said , &quot; &quot; the colonel &apos;s lady and judy o &apos;grady are sisters underneath the skin . &quot; &quot; ( applause )
we now have a platform .
jason started at darpa on march 18th , 2010 .
so again , we can see that price plays an enormous role in people &apos;s willingness to reduce their driving behavior .
the act of making is a social activity .
&quot; &quot; horizon , &quot; &quot; which takes its cue from the academics , won &apos;t touch it with a barge pole .
the department used to have a process which is very interesting .
and what they &apos;ve realized is that using violence in the situations they operate in is not only less humane , but it &apos;s less effective than using methods that connect people with people , that rebuild .
it wasn &apos;t simple to work in such environments , sometimes having pigs under you while you paint or climbing a stack of garbage to reach a lift .
it was practically everybody .
so the concept here : so if you do have a deceased or injured organ , we take a very small piece of that tissue , less than half the size of a postage stamp .
because most of you compared the price of this big mac to the price you &apos;re used to paying . rather than asking , &quot; &quot; what else can i do with my money , &quot; &quot; comparing this investment to other possible investments , you compared to the past .
be bold . stand up . be fearless . be confident .
and the conclusion was it was tasks that included social-evaluative threat — threats to self-esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance .
in the midst of such widespread uncertainty , we may , in fact , be insecure .
so , eventually , the manufacturers actually arrived at a compromise , which was the combo pack .
around the world , many people began to ask , can we ever stop ebola when it starts to spread like this ?
in recent years , because of global warming , they now cover about 10 percent — an increase by a factor of 25 to 50 .
these are just a few of the ideas that are to die for .
some of them show greater variability .
and they need to think about the substance of their agreement much more than about the labels they want to attach to them .
so the question is , so , why are they all standing there holding books ?
but the religious world doesn &apos;t think that way .
financially , seen over the long term , it was actually successful .
but what if that &apos;s not how we need to buy sneakers either ?
nuclear — there are two bars here .
one of the ranches is called the kirkeby ranch , and i &apos;ll take you there for a minute .
so clearly there was a problem with deforestation .
and that &apos;s the way , ultimately after some ups and downs , i ended up designing the chair i &apos;m going to show you .
well , they signed me up immediately .
my ideal world is a place where no one is left behind , where everyone is needed exactly where they are , like the fibers and the tendons in a bow , a place where the strong is flexible and the vulnerable is resilient .
that implies a lot of trust .
you see , the folks at the ministry of health , the hospital administrators , the doctors , the nurses — they are among just five percent of their peers who get an education after secondary school .
your phone is not very natural .
even if you don &apos;t want to , it &apos;s very difficult numerically .
i mean , that &apos;s a fine logic , that sounds pretty convincing , pretty ironclad , doesn &apos;t it ?
this is the power of nudges when trying to solve complex social problems , and when you do that , you shouldn &apos;t try to tell people how to adapt .
we found that we could discover the causation of the positive states , the relationship between left hemispheric activity and right hemispheric activity , as a cause of happiness .
i wanted to make more of these forests .
this is how to stop a runaway stage .
a well-crafted cyber attack could break into his phone , disable the overvoltage protections on his battery , drastically overload the circuit , cause the battery to overheat , and explode .
so are the pessimists right ?
a lot of my clients are very young .
that &apos;s a problem because they dropped two or three decent items .
this is a tapir .
and unlike the juicy salif , it does not threaten to attach itself to your brain , rather , it simply attaches itself to your brain .
and here &apos;s another example of that interesting cross-pollination between science and art .
we &apos;re only trying to improve our lives .
the earth can support that if we choose the right path .
but i think we &apos;re ignoring certain facts that tell us something about what we can do .
and later on in the night , i woke up because i &apos;m always waking up in the night , and i went by the computer and i see all these red dots , you know , on facebook , which i &apos;ve never seen before .
( laughter ) and what i realized is i needed an expert .
one was ray anderson , who turned — ( applause ) — turned , you know , a part of the evil empire into a zero-footprint , or almost zero-footprint business .
in afghanistan , people go to extraordinary lengths to be able to watch this program .
then we rebuild . then we respect . &quot; &quot; and i burst out in tears , because my father had only just died prior to this journey , and i didn &apos;t ever acknowledge him , i didn &apos;t ever appreciate him for the fact that i &apos;m probably standing here today because of him .
now people have a natural intuition about these trade-offs .
we can &apos;t just focus on identifying the best ; we &apos;ve got to move the rest .
and you know , there &apos;s another adage in hollywood , that nobody knows nothing about anything .
it became a policy of &quot; &quot; positive discrimination , &quot; &quot; we call it now .
but neither of my parents knew this was happening .
so these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .
it &apos;s at the tip of the guadalquivir river .
so , while this space represents someone &apos;s profession , this one certainly represents a passion .
and we commissioned them to make a maquette , or a bust , of benjamin .
candles can &apos;t burn in a vacuum , therefore , probably sparklers wouldn &apos;t either .
now this gets us quickly to the third and final bit for today ; namely , we need to lift our sights , to set our sights on well-being , so that life and health and healthcare can become about making life more wonderful , rather than just less horrible .
we wash the bug out .
hk : i take it as a good sign , because people feel secure in this democracy .
well , at that time — i should go back .
and that ability to get others to want what you want , to get the outcomes you want without coercion or payment , is what i call soft power .
other conditions show people the future self .
( laughter ) man : your father , is he alive ?
additional experiments are going on in other animals that are useful for creating models for human disease , such as monkeys .
this is morina . this is a plant — which i &apos;ve always thought to be rather tedious — named after morin , who was an enterprising french gardener , who issued the first seed catalog in 1621 .
understanding , to me , does not remove the wonder and the joy .
they were tough in the sense that , as i grew up , both my mother and father would always say to me , it &apos;s really important that you always remember two things .
if you hold it too tightly , you crush it .
but it &apos;s the living room .
that &apos;s , in the additive , about 25 percent of our problem .
at home it sounds kind of anticlimactic .
with much greater humility , he knocks again on the door .
here is here , and out there is out there . okay ?
and there are a number of schemes , which i don &apos;t want to dwell on , but this is the one that we finally used where we projected onto rear screen material that was molded in the face — literally in the face of the person .
let us therefore go to battle stations , not to fight each other , but to begin deflecting these incoming asteroids .
the last 20 years has been the age of intervention , and afghanistan is simply one act in a five-act tragedy .
it &apos;s to have a look at different worlds .
it &apos;s really good . it starts with &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; and goes to &quot; &quot; aw . &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; is high , the &quot; &quot; aw &quot; &quot; is low .
because of data .
here &apos;s another example .
i &apos;ve been lucky enough to answer some of these questions as i &apos;ve explored this nocturnal world .
so figuring out all these relationships with relative and absolute location , distance , timing , velocities — that &apos;s really the key to the science of moving dots , or as we like to call it , spatiotemporal pattern recognition , in academic vernacular .
it should not be . until one of my colleagues said , &quot; &quot; it looks to me like a thermal blister , and the mid-ocean ridge must be a cooling curve . &quot; &quot; we said , &quot; &quot; let &apos;s go find out . &quot; &quot; we punched a bunch of heat probes . everything made sense , except , at the axis , there was missing heat . it was missing heat .
well , more idea creators .
( laughter ) ( applause ) brought in more women .
but this , i show you , when kids from the poorest congressional district in america can build a 30-foot by 15-foot wall , design it , plant it and install it in the heart of new york city , that &apos;s a true &quot; &quot; sí se puede &quot; &quot; moment .
it &apos;s real slavery in exactly the same way that slavery would be recognized throughout all of human history .
you know , reputations are built on trust , consistency , transparency .
so now it &apos;s able to train with just this little piece on the back .
now you &apos;ve probably seen pictures of neurons before .
in the 1980s , i developed an underwater keyboard .
the entire project is predicated on this act of love which is listening itself .
we took the english story and translated it to russian .
we &apos;ve got the fox watching the henhouse here .
if there &apos;s an achilles &apos; heel in one our projects , we want to know it now , up front , not way down the road .
half the children in this classroom have no parents because they &apos;ve died through aids .
whether it &apos;s in sierra leone or in boston , i hope this not only restores but indeed transforms their sense of human potential .
but some of them spend a lot of time in the sand , making mountains and seas — well , not seas , but different things — people and dogs , etc .
like those chloroplast cells — they &apos;re completely surrounded by other life .
where does it stop ?
i &apos;ve been eating cereal for breakfast all of my life .
so low income here , high income there .
it &apos;s the autobiographical self which some species have , i think .
so to me , this was just so bizarre about how they could get the packaging so mysteriously beautiful and perfect and the message so unbearably , clearly wrong .
so it was true .
and stop where you want .
through back and forth conversations , they increase the resilience of the whole community .
how many people here have heard of pms ?
it &apos;s only a problem now when the chocolate is next to us .
i worked on a film called &quot; &quot; apollo 13 , &quot; &quot; and when i worked on this film , i discovered something about how our brains work , and how our brains work is that , when we &apos;re sort of infused with either enthusiasm or awe or fondness or whatever , it changes and alters our perception of things .
that was the question we wanted to know , so my colleagues and i decided to take a deep dive into the data .
anyway , i felt that it was important that you didn &apos;t have to make an adjustment in order to get this kind of action .
they blamed the leader of the opposition for not fighting it hard enough .
now it &apos;s a little bit less than 30 percent .
and so , she really just completely ignored me most of the time .
and i &apos;m working at all the energy i have to sort of communicate this message that we need preschool , we need head start , we need prenatal care .
( laughter ) ka : by being totally surprising and humorous , casey niestat got his funny idea and point seen five million times .
well , it &apos;s not going to come as any surprise for me to tell you that banks accept dirty money , but they prioritize their profits in other destructive ways too .
we developed leonardo in collaboration with stan winston studio .
but i did come to embrace this new identity , and in many ways i think of myself now as african .
and the technology we have developed — it &apos;s called sim ofdm .
on a business trip to florida in the early 1980s , bonica got a former student to drive him to the hyde park area in tampa .
it &apos;s really about designing from the inside out .
we wanted to be the only political party with no particular political leaning .
and i was in the states at the time , and they called me . he was very sick , the first time he got sick .
they inhabit the trees at all body sizes , and , of course , they inhabit the land .
what are they going to think when we actually form a colony on mars ?
it &apos;s true .
the more output you churn out , the more variety you get and the better your chances of stumbling on something truly original .
all of this is a variation of the if-then model .
and i believe that magic and puzzles are the same because they both key into one of the most important human drives : the urge to solve .
( laughter ) it will look something like this . ( laughter )
i wanted people to ask me about my experiences .
you are going to hit the ground .
you know viennese audiences usually don &apos;t interfere with the music .
instead , get rid of the school bell .
there , it &apos;s nothing more than a gurgle of water that issues forth from beneath a rock in a boulder in a pasture , high in the bitterroot mountains .
these are scottish terriers .
he really wants that sargassum .
teacher : well done . very good ...
now , already in the case of the brain disorders that i &apos;ve been talking to you about , depression , obsessive compulsive disorder , post-traumatic stress disorder , while we don &apos;t have an in-depth understanding of how they are abnormally processed or what the brain is doing in these illnesses , we have been able to already identify some of the connectional differences , or some of the ways in which the circuitry is different for people who have these disorders .
a lot of urban areas have been converted into parking lots in a sort of indiscriminate use .
to be able to change fences and window guards into flowers , it &apos;s fantastic .
so these all have the property of self-similarity : the part looks like the whole .
but it &apos;s not like that everywhere .
and that would take care of your problem , and that would provide the solution for you . &quot; &quot; so i immediately jumped in my car , went downtown , saw the trailer — it was a small trailer , but under the circumstances , i figured that was the best thing that i could do .
i remember my father receiving anonymous letters saying , &quot; &quot; your daughter is spreading western culture in the honorable societies . &quot; &quot; our car was stoned at one point .
think about it : in 2013 , the second decade of the millennium , if you &apos;re concerned about a cancer diagnosis and you go to your doctor , you get bone scans , biopsies and blood tests .
because egyptians are more optimistic than they have been in years , far less divided on religious-secular lines than we would think and poised for the demands of democracy .
the first thing i &apos;m going to show you is a change between age three and five , as kids learn to understand that somebody else can have beliefs that are different from their own .
now , it turns out that the more egalitarian our relationships , the happier both partners are .
it &apos;s analyzing trends . it &apos;s predicting the future .
it &apos;s quite hard , actually , to get those very small changes .
i don &apos;t need to know that at the end of the year when it &apos;s too late .
they &apos;re absolutely everywhere .
and then what happened ?
and this is how it works : patent holders , inventors that develop new medicines patent those inventions , but make those patents available to the medicines patent pool . the medicines patent pool then license those out to whoever needs access to those patents .
these are cane toads in australia .
because the personal , as you know , is political .
it &apos;s almost more important than their eyesight .
well , this is another trend in the field .
it uses x-rays , x-ray beams , that are rotating very fast around the human body .
this is not the stomping ground of our pleistocene ancestors .
it was like a star trek episode , you know ?
now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us , but we can admire the institutional way in which they &apos;re doing it .
let &apos;s look at spam .
it was , &quot; &quot; why are you doing the work that you &apos;re doing ? &quot; &quot; and so often their answer would be , &quot; well , because somebody told me i &apos;m supposed to . &quot;
and the concept is to create a kind of onion , a kind of structure in layers .
that machine doesn &apos;t care about the environment , about racism , about all these issues that make this life worse for all of us , and so the government does have a role to take resources from more productive uses , or from richer sources , and give them to other sources .
and then here &apos;s senegal — it &apos;s got a higher level of social progress than chad , but the same level of gdp .
so , visualizing information can give us a very quick solution to those kinds of problems .
we &apos;re going to do that very soon .
( laughter ) now it &apos;s just the way it is .
so that &apos;s where we are today , and that &apos;s what i wanted to give you a flavor of .
so you have less waste , and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign as it is with cow dung .
and for the past 23 years , at an increasing rate , we &apos;ve been pouring more and more ideas and capabilities and so on into mathematica , and i &apos;m happy to say that that &apos;s led to many good things in r &amp; d and education , lots of other areas .
( laughter ) but we don &apos;t have gta because , maybe it &apos;s my own reflection , i &apos;ve never been able to do anything but crashing cars and shooting prostitutes and pimps .
i think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time , thereby conserving mating time and energy .
what made me do it ? at school , i will admit this : academically , i couldn &apos;t express myself .
and of that stuff , what do you actually use ?
it never happened .
so close your eyes for a minute .
it goes down to 15 degrees centigrade from 35 , and comes out of this perfectly fine .
much of my life has been a quest to get some answers to these questions .
there were markets in africa before the colonialists stepped foot on the continent .
three days later , after everybody has left the home , my mom went and brought a nurse .
thank you .
11-year-olds cannot do simple addition , they cannot construct a grammatically correct sentence .
i started building this project when i was about 12 or 13 years old .
he says , &quot; &quot; i feel bad about the polar bears .
of course , they covered that with make-up , because lara croft did all those same stunts — but she doesn &apos;t get black and blue , because she has sprezzatura .
this little guy is called the kinesin , and he pulls a sack that &apos;s full of brand new manufactured proteins to wherever it &apos;s needed in the cell — whether it &apos;s to a membrane , whether it &apos;s to an organelle , whether it &apos;s to build something or repair something .
so there &apos;s a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic and that analogy is the electric industry .
but to me , they are fascinating objects to visually narrate a story .
and one of the most tedious ones , i think , was saying that beauty was about symmetry .
and even if they were able to do so , even if i &apos;m wrong , it &apos;s extremely unlikely the taliban would invite back al-qaeda .
and i think if we can do that , we might be able to fundamentally change not only human beings &apos; sense of their own agency and power — because i think that &apos;s the most wonderful thing about new power , is that people feel more powerful — but we might also be able to change the way we relate to each other and the way we relate to authority and institutions .
give us a few pages out of your playbook about what someone who is inspired about their city can do to take on projects like yours ?
and so , like many people , we start with a house on a lot , and i &apos;m going to show you a typical construction on the top and what we &apos;re doing on the bottom .
they &apos;ve never been dived . &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; yeah .
what glamour is all about — i took this from a blurb in the table of contents of new york magazine , which was telling us that glamour is back — glamour is all about transcending the everyday .
and there &apos;s opportunities in a circular economy .
and then as you enter it again , looking in all directions towards the city .
for example , xcl technologies , they developed two of the mission critical systems for the new boeing 787 dreamliner , one to avoid collisions in the sky , and another to allow landing in zero visibility .
i believe that everyday soundscape can be the most unexpected inspiration for songwriting , and to look at this idea a little bit more closely , i &apos;m going to talk today about three things : nature , language and silence — or rather , the impossibility of true silence .
and it has led me to think that perhaps these questions are the ones that propel people to cross the line , and that some affairs are an attempt to beat back deadness , in an antidote to death .
there have actually been 22 species of hominids that have been around , have evolved , have wandered in different places , have gone extinct .
the battle against corruption exacts a toll on ourselves , our families , our friends , and even our kids .
it &apos;s not , perhaps , the dimensions appreciated by art critics or architecture critics or city planners .
thank you .
this is the disney hall — the concert hall .
and i was particularly fascinated with sharks .
the civil defense programs were disconnected from the reality of what we &apos;d see in all-out nuclear war .
i don &apos;t know , and i should .
the average boy now watches 50 porn video clips a week .
we &apos;re about to ride the wave of technological opportunity .
or that we require kids to sit still too much , and so boys initially feel like failures ?
and so this is after a day and about half a night smelting this iron .
today , these roads that interconnect our world are dominated by cars and trucks that have remained largely unchanged for 100 years .
but here &apos;s the thing : we are the only advanced civilization in the solar system , but that doesn &apos;t mean that there is no microbial life nearby .
we are here to dream together .
now to some , this was an audacious goal , because our school is located in the brownsville section of brooklyn — one of the most underserved and violent neighborhoods in all of new york city .
a recent study in the archives of surgery reported surgeons removing healthy ovaries , operating on the wrong side of the brain , carrying out procedures on the wrong hand , elbow , eye , foot , and also mistakes born out of thinking errors .
obviously , it &apos;s difficult to calculate .
the first one was actually two hours .
( applause ) can we cue the music please ? ( applause )
so , as a bottom-of-the-rung architecture graduate , i might expect to earn about 24,000 pounds .
this is a facility dedicated to the next generation of aviation fuels using halophytes .
why the need for accumulating money , then doing philanthropy ?
what we &apos;ve found is a whole range of new viruses in these individuals , including new viruses in the same group as hiv — so , brand new retroviruses .
i only need two things .
this is in 1960 .
it all comes back to those ones and zeros .
but the real secret i think lies more in the way that they organize their society .
today , i don &apos;t write the translation of the message anymore on the wall .
that &apos;s what art is for .
this is systemic causation .
now you look at a master &apos;s student , a little further along in their education , and you see they know a bit more , but it &apos;s been narrowed somewhat .
so , what is to be done ?
and it ends like this : &quot; &quot; this telegraph is a fantastic instrument to diffuse religion , civilization , liberty and law throughout the world . &quot; &quot; those are nice words . but i got sort of curious of what he meant with liberty , and liberty for whom .
i found these little bits of glass .
charlie : not in my book , it isn &apos;t .
lotte reiniger , an amazing shadow puppeteer in the 20s , that started doing more elaborate things .
we collect data on animal populations , analyze complex patterns , try to explain them .
lewis , have the courage to go in there , because we are going to look after you every moment of it . &quot; &quot; and i just , i got so much confidence from him saying that , because he knew me so well .
india , the largest democracy in the world , 94 and dropping .
greenpeace and other organizations put that number in the tens of thousands .
devices like this will bring 3d holographic content right into our world , enhancing the way we experience life beyond our ordinary range of perceptions .
we never succeeded in using ten fingers , but there are certain things you can do , obviously , with more than one-finger input , which is rather fascinating .
last i heard we had 93 percent accepted to college .
then we could all be engaged in helping .
my goal is to be able to travel and do things that are simple to you .
it &apos;s clear that multilateral cooperation is essential .
this is the former trolley terminal that was the depot for passengers traveling over the williamsburg bridge from brooklyn to manhattan , and it was open between 1908 and 1948 , just around the time when my grandparents were living right in the area .
and i have one right here .
introduction of red down here , when whales are being cut up .
age is another thing when our attitude toward our appearance changes .
and according to that theory , it &apos;s already too late to avoid a disaster , because if it &apos;s true that our best option at the moment is to prevent co2 emissions with something like the kyoto protocol , with its constraints on economic activity and its enormous cost of hundreds of billions of dollars , or whatever it is , then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure .
now i eat whenever i &apos;m hungry , and i &apos;ve lost 10 pounds .
then in early 2007 , a really interesting thing happened .
you see that enough in the media .
so kids don &apos;t have as hard of a time with this , and i saw in my own son , i gave him this book .
now in a sense , when we think about the effect of video games on the brain , it &apos;s very similar to the effect of wine on the health .
it &apos;s an accelerated view , where you can see the robot actually carrying out some of its replication process .
we know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like .
paint is all low-volume chemical , which is very important when you &apos;re working in the room all the time .
i had a bit of an epiphany being lost in pennsylvania , and i took a left turn trying to get back to the highway .
when we have a bad idea , the response to a bad idea is not no ideas , it &apos;s not to stop thinking .
a person can come in and take somebody else &apos;s gown , cut off three inches from the bottom , go to the e.u. and register it as a new , original design .
ka : obviously , what you faced in trying to do something as substantial as this project — and this is only one of four that you &apos;ve designed to surround the site — you must have run up against the incredibly byzantine , entrenched bureaucracy and powers that be in new york real estate and new york politics .
i &apos;m being told which part of the stick to use .
there &apos;s the solar panels of the cell , some switches that turn your genes on and off , the girders of the cell , motors that move your muscles .
out of that empathy , he spun a whole new field , played a major role in getting medicine to acknowledge pain in and of itself .
when the participants arrived for their interview , i offered them a set of drinks : coke , diet coke , sprite — seven , to be exact .
on the other , every time you turned to your phone , there is this deluge of insults .
it wasn &apos;t the resume of breaking this record here , it was more like , who had i become ?
and there was a project with , funded by the national science foundation — sent a bunch of scanners , and the american libraries were supposed to send books .
i know i should mention : i &apos;m making all these things .
is it just the wind or a dangerous predator ?
we see this in the public sector as well .
( laughter ) we tore everything down and buried it in his backyard .
it lives in our oceans and in freshwater ponds .
( applause ) in my very last example — i do a lot of my work using speech recognition software .
now failure to produce enough insulin is incompatible with life .
it challenges the norms .
if we perceive it in this way as a brand , or other ways of thinking at it like this , we will not resolve or counter terrorism .
that &apos;s where dinosaur origins is to be found : at the bottom of the cliff .
this is a more interesting one where half faces were shown to some people , and then to add them into a list of most beautiful to least beautiful and then exposing a full face .
thank you very much . ( applause )
for reference , fact one : exxon &apos;s revenues in 2005 were a billion dollars a day .
but now you &apos;ve got this virus in there , and we don &apos;t know what the long-term effects of that are .
so where do we go now ?
sighted astronomers depend on this kind of plot in order to interpret how this light intensity changes over time .
and again , closely related to inequality .
they all bitched about each other . i mean , quite gossipy , those cables . okay , but i thought it was a very important point for all of us to grasp , these are human beings just like us . they don &apos;t have special powers .
so what we really want to focus on is the long-run evolution of wealth inequality , and what &apos;s going to happen in the future .
and it is always extraordinary to see a thing of beauty .
so , good things come out of , you know , incomprehension — ( laughter ) — which i will do a painting of , and then it will end up in my work .
so if you were there 3.3 million years ago , to hear when this girl was crying out for her mother , she would have sounded more like a chimpanzee than a human .
umar also has polio .
and so , we wanted to know , how green could we be ?
didn &apos;t know how on earth i &apos;d ever pass a medical .
it was sensitive , we had to go up the chain of command , convince them that this was the right thing to do and do all of this on electronic medium .
i have to say , this sounds awesome . ( laughter ) i could totally have used this 10 minutes ago .
so that &apos;s where we stand at the moment , and i &apos;ve just got a few final thoughts , which is that this is another way in which biology is now coming in to supplement chemistry in some of our societal advances in this area , and these biological approaches are coming in in very different forms , and when you think about genetic engineering , we &apos;ve now got enzymes for industrial processing , enzymes , genetically engineered enzymes in food .
so she &apos;s even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn &apos;t stupid , even though she thought she could look stupid .
we &apos;re not the only ones .
this is the result of my hobby , which is unofficial bin inspections . ( laughter ) strange you might think , but if we could rely on corporations to tell us what they were doing in the back of their stores , we wouldn &apos;t need to go sneaking around the back , opening up bins and having a look at what &apos;s inside .
sp : the imprisonment of nonviolent drug offenders and the toleration of rape in our nation &apos;s prisons .
and that is me , going to , hurrying to uganda , to try to save that 4,000 material , with people carrying them on the bikes , bicycles .
this is autumn 1989 , and imagine that all those people standing up and protesting for change had a mobile phone in their pocket .
it &apos;s a free swimming shark with a satellite tag jumping after salmon , sending home its data .
so where does this leave us ?
so , about three years ago i was in london , and somebody called howard burton came to me and said , i represent a group of people , and we want to start an institute in theoretical physics .
i would argue , only government is capable of creating these necessary conditions for economies to thrive .
and the acoustic habitat of the north atlantic right whale has been reduced by up to 90 percent .
so , basically in 2002 there were 1,200 dancing bears .
this is a black coral called leiopathes , an image taken by my colleague , brendan roark , about 500 meters below hawaii .
but , in fact , you can start , even though we haven &apos;t trained this neocortical column to create a specific reality .
they claim to be psychics , or sensitives , whatever they can .
but we &apos;ve got an opportunity to recycle them into something more useful that enables us to get energy all of the time .
well , suffice it to say it &apos;s not all like that , but that &apos;s part of it .
ca : what , to power — for lighting and stuff ?
i love my mother , but she thought i was wasting my life with this museum stuff .
and i &apos;m sure buckminster fuller would be very , very proud to see a bamboo geodesic dome .
but it &apos;s an animal that &apos;s about 98 percent in decline throughout most of its range .
and today , less than five years in , kiva &apos;s facilitated more than 150 million dollars , in little 25-dollar bits , from lenders and entrepreneurs — more than a million of those , collectively in 200 countries .
it &apos;s not the same thing as good , better and best .
he felt it . he lived it .
i was past 40 when my father died .
they &apos;re big , hot planets that are easy to see .
the managers and the security guards , on the other hand , did not find it particularly funny .
what we need to do is to use our ingenuity and our scientific knowledge to try to design a new generation of treatments that are targeted to specific neurons and specific regions of the brain that are affected in particular psychiatric disorders .
we &apos;ve only just begun to analyze all of this data .
so we took a drug that is already known and by just delivering it locally where it &apos;s needed the most , we allow a response that is 12 times more powerful , reducing the systemic toxic effect .
it &apos;s sort of called a meta-motivational theory about how we look , a theory about motivation and the mood we &apos;re in and how the mood we &apos;re in determines the things we like or dislike .
what it means is all the guys were lying about their height .
and the chinese then , in one of their periods of media openness , decided that they were going to let it go , that they were going to let this citizen reporting fly .
and we wanted to push the idea of the music video that was meant for the web beyond the four-by-three or sixteen-by-nine window and try to make it play out and choreograph throughout the screen .
and how big a problem is this ?
it makes for an exotic and chilly commute .
the final project i &apos;ll talk about is one that &apos;s very close to my heart , and it involves an economic and social value that is associated with epiphytic plants .
but what if we get it right ?
and that &apos;s why helium &apos;s called helium .
it &apos;s usually presided over by religious leaders and village elders , and jirgas are often used in rural countries like afghanistan , where there &apos;s deep-seated resentment against the formal system .
at the lower end of the scale , you find a rigid sequence , a sequence of all a &apos;s , and you also find a computer program , in this case in the language fortran , which obeys really strict rules .
now think about it . this is an amazing thing : that in this frequency range where whales communicate , the main source globally , on our planet , for the noise comes from human ships , thousands of human ships , distant , far away , just all aggregating .
pigs have dna .
so if this is now , and that &apos;s the past , and we start thinking about change , you know , all governments are seeking change , you &apos;re here seeking change , everybody &apos;s after change , it &apos;s really cool . ( laughter ) so what happens is , we get this wonderful whooshing acceleration and change .
if they don &apos;t know , who are the people trying to influence the decision , how much clout do they have , how much they care about this issue , and what do they say they want , are they experts ? that &apos;s what it means to be an expert , that &apos;s the basic stuff an expert needs to know .
and the thing that &apos;s so unique about our species is that we &apos;re really designed to play through our whole lifetime .
so when i came back there , i found these two kids , eight- and 12-year-olds , who were playing a game on the computer .
we &apos;ll go into areas we have no knowledge of .
so what we did is we took all the books — we just ordered them by time — for each book we take the words and we project them to the space , and then we ask for each word how close it is to introspection , and we just average that .
based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness , cognitive behavioral therapy , &#91; very &#93; strong for our well being .
it &apos;s practiced , it &apos;s no anesthesia , it &apos;s a rusty old knife , and it was difficult .
corals are born in a number of different ways , but most often by mass spawning : all of the individuals of a single species on one night a year , releasing all the eggs they &apos;ve made that year into the water column , packaged into bundles with sperm cells .
the third step , following the second step , is to create new mental habits .
lp : yeah , absolutely .
in germany , they made one small change without checking with me — nor did they have to , because it was done through agencies — but see if you can tell the difference .
how do we know that all those graphs , all that progress , is enough to solve what you showed in the first part ?
take a look at this plant .
so this is the end of a ph.d. project from one of the best robotics institutes .
why did it fail miserably ?
sometimes , you get disease organisms that don &apos;t rely on host mobility at all for transmission .
here &apos;s a slide of the first 1,000 digits of this prime .
it &apos;s now home to alma , the large telescope that &apos;s being developed there .
she argued and argued , and finally she struck lucky when a researcher came through town studying the history of mines in the area , and she told him her story , and at first , of course , like everyone , he didn &apos;t believe her , but he went back to seattle and he did his own research and he realized that she was right .
it &apos;s a very logical plan , but it was not always like this .
with a brain the size of a peanut , they maintain individualized , long-term social bonds , we didn &apos;t know that was possible .
empathy and respect . empathy and respect .
most of us got put in front of a disciplinary council , and were rejected from the communities that we loved because we wanted to make them better , because we believed that they could be .
as susan cain said in her &quot; &quot; quiet &quot; &quot; book , in a chapter that featured the strange canadian professor who was teaching at the time at harvard , i sometimes go to the men &apos;s room to escape the slings and arrows of outrageous extroverts .
he suspected an outbreak that concentrated would probably involve a single point source .
let &apos;s first at least decide what is it we &apos;re trying to achieve . &quot; &quot; so with a lot of push and pull and debate , haryana set itself a goal which said : by 2020 , we want 80 percent of our children to be at grade-level knowledge .
and that rover will be more kind of like a chemist .
we also think that individuals can make a difference , and they should , because individuals , together , we can all help create a movement .
aging : the problem is enormous , 300,000 broken hips per year ; but the solutions are extraordinary , and they include so many different things .
we &apos;ve been asking it here at ted already .
so governments who are failing , who are dropping the ball at a national level , have even less ability to get their arms around the problem at an international level .
that &apos;s understandable and important .
and you can see an image produced by this consortium .
and we &apos;ve reached that time . we cannot afford to underestimate this problem . if we face irreversible and catastrophic consequences , we must act , and we must act decisively .
soldiers have a name for these clips .
doaa was sitting with her legs crammed up to her chest , bassem holding her hand .
there are political food fights .
take the first step , as soon as life appeared on this earth .
it &apos;s the best return on investment they ever received . ( laughter ) ca : and the best news of all , i guess , is this .
it has to decide whether to turn around and stay in the same odor , or whether to cross the midline and try something new .
let &apos;s put it that way .
and i &apos;ve put the formula up there .
but as far as we know , we &apos;re the only upright-walking ape that exists on planet earth today , except for the bonobos .
so if the world is not as it seems and we see things as we are , then what we call reality is a kind of hallucination happening inside here . it &apos;s a waking dream , and understanding that that is what we actually exist in is one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history .
in chapter seven , i focus on the effects of a genocidal act on one bloodline .
and an interesting thing happened : the jacques cousteau shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on earth .
it &apos;s a perfect world .
they only know the moments that make up their story , even when the book is closed .
my seduction into the world of fireflies began when i was back in graduate school .
teacher : do not pay any attention to what anybody else is doing .
in san ramon , california , they published an iphone app in which they allow you or me to say we are certified cpr-trained , and then when someone has a heart attack , a notification goes out so that you can rush over to the person over here and deliver cpr .
we were all scared and confused .
for starters , there are two things we can all do .
however , there is an underlying argument about logistics , which has driven so much of this debate . right ?
that &apos;s a huge problem .
do you live in a more walkable city or do you live in a less walkable city , or where in your city do you live ?
and now libya as you see it .
but our multitasking reality is pretty different , and full of tons of information .
the rest of us are meant to feel like amateurs in the sense of suckers .
and everybody &apos;s a narrator , because everybody has a story to tell .
now , i am going to show you how my bow works .
and the way i think about this is that healthcare is like any other system .
it started as a means of self-expression .
so it &apos;s not obvious how it leads to inflation in the country doing the actual printing unless it leads to a currency depreciation of that country .
in a region famous for the soft , porous loess plateau soil , there lived until recently an estimated 40 million people in these houses underground .
maybe you want to invest in a stock market of things .
then you &apos;re going to paste them where it makes sense for you to place your own statement .
so what &apos;s goliath ? he &apos;s heavy infantry , and his expectation when he challenges the israelites to a duel is that he &apos;s going to be fighting another heavy infantryman .
in a nutshell , that &apos;s what i was trying to do with these things , but more importantly , that &apos;s what the past 30 years of music has been .
there &apos;s something terrible happening . &quot; &quot; and she said , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t be so silly . &quot; &quot; and i started to cry .
so when i was eight years old , a new girl came to join the class , and she was so impressive , as the new girl always seems to be .
but what might feel just right for that middle-aged executive can be a problem for an adolescent who needs to develop face-to-face relationships .
lassa virus is a lot like ebola .
not the kind of librarian that takes her glasses off , lets her hair down , suddenly she &apos;s smoking hot .
and i cut it into smaller questions , and i have the answer to these smaller questions .
( music : &quot; &quot; flight of the bumblebee &quot; &quot; ) ao : or another one ? how about in g minor ?
salman rushdie was pissed-off i think because i altered the map of new york , if you notice .
in sweden we read it once and then we went partying .
those half of you , roughly , who are women , at some point may have had a pregnancy test .
you can see the lgbt community is not really getting along with the geek community that well , the arts community , the music community .
and i did everything i could to spend my time , every waking hour possible trying to hound these guys , hanging out and having beers and workouts , whatever it was .
so , this is an example of a device made from a simple piece of paper .
rb : well , i like to think it stands for quality , that you know , if somebody comes across a virgin company , they — ca : they are quality , richard . come on now , everyone says quality . spirit ?
so he got volunteers to go move to cuba and live in tents and be voluntarily infected with yellow fever .
and you can see the red dots , in this particular patient &apos;s case , were finger sticks , which would have missed both ends .
i had so many examples — i have so many instances like this , when i &apos;m writing a story , and i cannot explain it .
and i think that &apos;s a really damaging and dangerous narrative that we have , that allows these types of things to happen , as the general public just kind of turns a blind eye to it .
so i &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; cool . i can do whatever the hell i want , since it &apos;s my responsibility and i gotta maintain it . &quot; &quot; and this is how i decided to maintain it .
( laughter ) i &apos;m also a software engineer , and i make lots of different kinds of art with the computer .
here &apos;s the thing : everybody loves a beautiful baby .
so what you &apos;re seeing on the left is a touch device .
what would be your reason ?
i now decide where i &apos;m going to be in that space , so i &apos;m down on this small part of the bottom rib of the letter &quot; &quot; e , &quot; &quot; and i &apos;m thinking about it , and i &apos;m imagining this space that &apos;s really high and above . if i asked you to reach out — you don &apos;t have to literally do it , but in mind — reach out to the top of the &quot; &quot; e , &quot; &quot; where would you reach ?
they have to be able to act along with their fellow actors in the production .
they &apos;re not very animated . ( laughter ) this was the fourth take , i &apos;m told . ( laughter ) okay . so , as we &apos;re talking about cambridge , let &apos;s now move on to technical advancements , because since we started putting this technology on mobile phones less than 12 months ago , the speed and the processing in these devices has grown at a really phenomenal rate , and that means that i can now take cinema-quality 3d models and place them in the world around me , so i have one over here .
so breaking things back down and delivering smartly , elegantly , sophisticated solutions that take into consideration the entire system and the entire life of the thing , everything , all the way back to the extraction through to the end of life , we can start to actually find really innovative solutions .
he was in some sort of catatonic state where he could be aware of his surroundings , but couldn &apos;t even blink to indicate that he was alive .
but i don &apos;t believe in hope without endeavor .
it was a very , very terrifying situation .
and because of that , as grain changes hands — and i &apos;ve measured that it changes hands four , five times in its trajectory from the farmer to the consumer — every time it changes hands — and i &apos;ve seen this all over rural africa — it also changes sacks .
so these two devices , drivegrip and speedstrip , are very effective .
in fact , when i know the data that &apos;s being shared and i &apos;m asked explicitly for my consent , i want some sites to understand my habits .
so i just put the paper on the focal length , which was an etching print , then i got the portrait of &#91; the &#93; sun from sunlight .
my lab started working on this , and i want to show you the result .
i &apos;ve lost count of how many times people of all sizes have told me that the show has changed their lives , how it helped them shift their relationship to their own and other people &apos;s bodies , and how it made them confront their own bias .
and also , one year , the g3 bondi blue thing — that caddy would come out , like , dangerous , like , &quot; &quot; whack , &quot; &quot; like that .
it &apos;s an extraordinary change .
or it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be .
today &apos;s cybercriminal , what do they look like ?
so , all we would need to do is to fit a small microchip to every potential illumination device .
when we look at a map of los angeles or london , it is hard to believe that as of 2005 , only 15 percent of the world was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail .
nowhere in the world do women earn the same as men .
it &apos;s almost like ...
and some things look very familiar today .
in other words , we have possibly stumbled upon the holy grail of modern day planetary exploration , or in other words , an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms .
egos , systems of government — figuring it out — massive change .
in the tool that we &apos;ve built , what we did was we collected 1.5 million cases from all around the united states , from cities , from counties , from every single state in the country , the federal districts .
bogota , where mayor mockus , when he was mayor , he introduced a transportation system that saved energy , that allowed surface buses to run in effect like subways , express buses with corridors .
people have created and invested millions of dollars into non-profit organizations with the mission of helping people who are poor .
&quot; &quot; i don &apos;t know . you know ?
by 2010 , college graduates , if you said two circles followed by a semicircle , two sixteens followed by what , they would say eight , because eight is half of 16 .
he was clearly embarrassed .
we object to genetically engineered food .
ok . now . if something absorbs the energy , the electron can travel .
the name is a misnomer .
what happens is , they burn into flash memory the software , and then test them for a few hours .
and a small indulgence , like eating one scoop of ice cream , is more likely to lead to a food binge in controlled eaters .

once you start cutting things in half , you kind of get carried away , so you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan .
we &apos;re awfully careful in the lab to try and avoid various biohazards .
the membrane is translucent .
we back so far up we &apos;re finally seeing a containment around us — the afterglow of the big bang .
and this is a static culture .
for example , the one on the left here allows me to add a little bit of reverb to my sound , which gives me that — ( trumpet ) — flavor .
as you know , an animation is a series of images .
we went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on .
i have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation .
( laughter ) which just resulted in a fantastic photograph . ( laughter )
the students were just scared : scared to sit in rows in fear that something would happen ; scared because they were often teased in the cafeteria for eating free food .
it &apos;s like , why didn &apos;t i follow up on that ?
and this is a picture of hong ngu , vietnam today .
one woman i talked to , who also told a joke that landed badly , she stayed home for a year and a half .
there &apos;s something sacred about a space where you can work on a project , and you don &apos;t have to justify to anyone that it &apos;s going to make a lot of money , that it &apos;s going to save mankind , or even that it &apos;s feasible .
the real trouble comes when pregnant women are , in a sense , unreliable narrators , when fetuses are led to expect a world of scarcity and are born instead into a world of plenty .

in the decades to come , 75 percent of the world &apos;s population will live in cities , and 50 of those cities will be of 10 million people or more .
we can use technology for transparency , and many other things .
if some of you play chess , you &apos;ll know that 64 is a square number , and that &apos;s why chessboards , eight by eight , have 64 squares .
and now , together , what we can see on this ocean of color that &apos;s temperature , we can see ten-day worms of makos and salmon sharks .

it &apos;s the only possible explanation of why humans , if they &apos;re very unlucky , can become grossly obese , in a way that would be totally impossible for any other primate , physically impossible .
what about anyone with body image stuff going on ?
i &apos;m listening to the sound of my voice , my voice on surreptitiously taped phone calls that a supposed friend had made the year before .
but before we pat ourselves too much on the back , we have poured 151 megawatt hours of energy into constructing this house when there was a house there before .
what &apos;s a drug ? a drug is made up of a small molecule of hydrogen , carbon , oxygen , nitrogen , and a few other atoms all cobbled together in a shape , and it &apos;s those shapes that determine whether , in fact , that particular drug is going to hit its target .
thank you . ( applause )
realizing that nyota might get hurt , panbanisha , like any human mother , carefully tugs to get the scissors back .
how much ?
the first is that there is so much more to learn and we &apos;re not making the investment in fully understanding the extent of these sex differences .
and that &apos;s where our goal is — to have something clinically pragmatic to wear .
i want to hold your hand . i want to hold your hand .
so how do we prevent them ?
no helicopter can reach you out there , and no plane can land .
we could make a space for change .

and if you look at the figures up there , it says that we have a third more mouths to feed , but we need an agricultural production increase of 70 percent .
and i meet them at the university , i also have a few field offices that i set up in various places that provide an immersion in some of the environmental challenges we face .

what i really did was i just followed nature , and nature doesn &apos;t know monocultures , but a natural forest is multilayered .
you don &apos;t need to dig down for these chemicals , and we can do things much more efficiently .

if we looked in the world of 1945 and looked at the map of capitalist economies and democratic polities , they were the rare exception , not the norm .

the largest set piece in the opera is called the system . it &apos;s a series of books .
but what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones .
broadband is not necessary .

and right now most of the preparedness is deeply flawed .
and i think this is something really important .
she is an illiterate girl , trained , skilled as a welder .
they don &apos;t feel as if they &apos;re doing something that really matters to them , so they pick up these kinds of activities .
( laughter ) so , nobody would like this .
but you can see the beginning of an idea there , because you can see the word &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; emerging from the &quot; &quot; old . &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what happens .
( applause ) when i went to visit him two days later , he gave me a hug and was crying and thanking me for saving his life .
there &apos;s a cave where all these animal-headed creatures travel between two worlds .
well , it &apos;s simple in the sense that it has fewer neurons , but is that a fair metric ?
jh : are you ripping off somebody else &apos;s avatar with that , sort of — pr : no , no . i didn &apos;t . one of the other guys at work had a fantastic avatar — a female avatar — that i used to be once in a while .
here it says the word &quot; &quot; mathematics . &quot; &quot; but actually , they &apos;re just dots , right ?
their marketing is slightly different .
we have to , we must .
so there are 30 wars that are about as deadly as the six days war , but there &apos;s only four wars that are 100 times deadlier — like world war i.
but nobody was really worried about this .
he looks pretty good at this stage .
we collected 200,000 jars of peanut butter and over 365,000 valentine &apos;s day cards .
he just sat there watching me cry for an hour .
this young man posted a video of him abusing his cat on youtube .

last january , my company , fark.com , was sued along with yahoo , msn , reddit , aol , techcrunch and others by a company called gooseberry natural resources .
i am very happy and honored to be amidst very , very innovative and intelligent people .

what we say — and i include the most austerely mechanistic among us , which is probably me — what we say is , &quot; &quot; vile monster , prison is too good for you . &quot; &quot; or worse , we seek revenge , in all probability thereby triggering the next phase in an escalating cycle of counter-revenge , which we see , of course , all over the world today .
and so we peer through a legal microscope , and look at everything .
it &apos;s efficient not only because toyota invested in material science but because they invested in behavioral science .
electronics kits are very powerful in that they teach us how things work , but the constraints inherent in their design influence the way we learn .
to pretend they &apos;re not a mess when they are a mess .
again , you can do that outside and just let it dry in the air .
first , population growth .
and so far there are only three major sources of that — coal and gas , hydro-electric , which in most places is maxed-out — and nuclear .
and be able to type into wolfram alpha , &quot; &quot; the theory of the universe , &quot; &quot; and have it tell us .
and it just went to prove that storytelling has guidelines , not hard , fast rules .
but the next step is called &quot; &quot; universal responsibility . &quot; &quot; and that is very important — the charter of compassion must lead us to develop through true compassion , what is called &quot; &quot; universal responsibility . &quot; &quot; in the great teaching of his holiness the dalai lama that he always teaches everywhere , he says that that is the common religion of humanity : kindness .

and i asked him , &quot; &quot; how is it possible to do this ? &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; well , i guess with everything in life , there &apos;s a place of balance . &quot; &quot; and this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point .
a room like this has acoustics , this one very good acoustics .
we even heal them .
i &apos;m going to log in .
we feel we &apos;re on the beginning of a journey of experiment and improvement to turn the studio school idea into something which is present , not as a universal answer for every child , but at least as an answer for some children in every part of the world .
and that , by the way , is why i think men so often wear ties . ( laughter )
that &apos;s a haiti earthquake every eight days .
so we worked hard to refocus our agenda , to maximize efficient mobility , providing more room for buses , more room for bikes , more room for people to enjoy the city , and to make our streets as safe as they can be for everybody that uses them .

here are some selection planes .
and i asked the founder of this effort , called tahrir supplies , how long it took him to go from when he had the idea to when he got started .
and i &apos;m following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as i &apos;m holding the light in the same position , i &apos;m getting the same type of reflection on it — that &apos;s the level of detail i &apos;m going into this thing .
the fuel , like i said , is ceramic inside zirconium fuel rods , and in the event of an accident in one of these type of reactors , fukushima and three mile island — looking back at three mile island , we didn &apos;t really see this for a while — but these zirconium claddings on these fuel rods , what happens is , when they see high pressure water , steam , in an oxidizing environment , they &apos;ll actually produce hydrogen , and that hydrogen has this explosive capability to release fission products .
in fact , if you look just at the upper and northern states in the west , they could do geothermal , or you could look at texas and say , we could lead the nation in the solutions to smart grid .
so , okay .
first of all , i &apos;d like to give you an argument for why that list is complete .
so on the one hand , there was a mocking of authority , but on the other hand , there was a deference towards authority , and these caribbean people had an overbearing obedience towards authority , which is very striking , very strange in a way , because migrants are very courageous people .
sarah smith , who was a mathematics professor at mit , wrote , &quot; &quot; the playful search for beauty was man &apos;s first activity — that all useful qualities and all material qualities were developed from the playful search for beauty . &quot; &quot; these are tiles . the word , &quot; &quot; playful &quot; &quot; is a necessary aspect of our work because , actually , one of our problems is that we have to make , produce , lovely things throughout all of life , and this for me is now 75 years .

just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect : when we teach people about the pleasant life , how to have more pleasure in your life , one of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills , the savoring skills , and you &apos;re assigned to design a beautiful day .
( laughter ) a gigantic helmet .
furthermore , there &apos;s an experimental way to tell this theory , apart from the inflationary explanation that i told you before .
what we &apos;re trying to do , or what we believe , because this is how we believe the world really works , is that without the environment you have nothing .

and as you breathe , think about what is in your breath .
tesla , what is 236 multiplied by 501 ?
a couple years ago , i was in south africa on safari .
and we need to be able to build this thing using simple manufacturing techniques and factories that don &apos;t cost us a fortune .
in other words , unlike the word hope , which one could look up in a dictionary and derive origins for , and , perhaps , reach some kind of a consensual use analysis , these are essentially contested concepts .
to begin with , artificial landscapes , which i invented sort of , are used in cinema all the time .
i love to think what they thought , what it was like .
to sort of illustrate that , this diagram emphasizes that if you &apos;ve got a sick person in bed , somebody &apos;s going to be taking out the contaminated materials .
and you have a problem making ends meet .
they &apos;re focusing on very cheap , very easy-to-use tools .
then i &apos;m going tell you about what we , as sex workers , actually want .
so this — ( applause ) thank you very much . ( applause ) this is not only useful for stadia . we can use that also in open-air places and streets , and we &apos;ve been working on the city of the future in masdar , which is in the united emirates , abu dhabi .
and geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology .
now just because we have a distributed foot and spines doesn &apos;t mean you can climb vertical surfaces .
you turn a faucet and there is warm water and cold water , and drinkable water .
( laughter ) so that christmas — maybe i &apos;ve got time for this — that christmas i got the mister wizard fun-o-rama chemistry set .
as a person who buys the products .
bernard devauchelle and sylvie testelin , who did the first operation , are studying that .
we use technology to define ourselves by sharing our thoughts and feelings even as we &apos;re having them .
north korea did that to some extent .
you can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted .
the luwak is an asian palm civet .
it is not a fork designed to grab three hors d &apos;oeuvres at a time , which would be useful out in the lobby , i would say .
but we were still missing a critical element .
it &apos;s impossible .
taking that idiom of , as it were , the darkness of the body transferred to architecture , can you use architectural space not for living but as a metaphor , and use its systolic , diastolic smaller and larger spaces to provide a kind of firsthand somatic narrative for a journey through space , light and darkness ?
and it has altered the earth . it covers earth like a skin .
and a clash is going to take place , like on the banks of the indus .
and we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges , to do that which we must do .
researchers at the cdc and other places have increasingly been linking suburban development patterns with sedentary lifestyles .
and most importantly , they show us it &apos;s never too late to change your story .
( laughter ) so it was traumatizing , actually .
we were saying no to something that was very important to them , challenging their code of honor , and hurting them deeply in the process .
and so glaciers are these magnificent beings , and there &apos;s lots of reasons to be obsessed with them , but what i &apos;m particularly interested in is in human-glacier relations .
but lately i have had the opportunity to take a step back and ask myself : &quot; &quot; what is it over the last few years that helped me grow my website , but also grow myself ? &quot; &quot; and i &apos;ve summarized those things , for me personally , as three as .
we &apos;re going to see them more like this , as part of the productive , organic framework of which they are inevitably a part , symbiotically connected .
( beep ) ( beep ) ( beep ) kt : oh , my god !
the colors are codes for the direction , from whether it is back to front or vice versa .
somehow in tickling our eardrum that transmits energy down our hearing bones , which get converted to a fluid impulse inside the cochlea and then somehow converted into an electrical signal in our auditory nerves that somehow wind up in our brains as a perception of a song or a beautiful piece of music .
partly , they &apos;d had a bit of a delay .
you can have winds 20 to 40 miles an hour .
one way to look at it is this .
and there &apos;s the first little cam that drove furby .
you know , they engage .
&quot; &quot; it hurt so much , and i shed some tears , but something inside of me wanted to do this despite his words .
that &apos;s lower than the figure in the united states .

&quot; &quot; naked city &quot; &quot; is a nickname for new york , and &quot; &quot; spleen &quot; &quot; embodies the melancholia and inertia that come from feeling alienated in an urban environment .
so about a hundred years ago , some scientists invented a stain that would stain cells .
and so if i &apos;m going to pursue them , i need to have the capability to go after them , and again , the controls are in how i apply that capability , not that i have the capability itself .
so it could be from writing to our local politician to talking to our boss at work or being the boss at work , or talking with our friends and family , or , quite simply , changing our lifestyles .
( laughter ) you — so it &apos;s — yes , he likes that .
imagine that you slice your body in all these directions , and then you try to put the slices back together again into a pile of data , into a block of data .

it &apos;s 23 feet long and just six feet across at its widest point .
the next morning , when she comes again to the so-called clinic , her first patient is waiting for her with her husband .
pure content and pure form , side by side .

i looked for temporary materials , like spitting out food — ( laughter ) — sidewalk chalk and even frozen wine .
they also exist as corporate entities .
benki came back to his village full of ideas — new technologies , new research , new ways of understanding what was going on .
it &apos;s been tremendously powerful for consumers .
so it doesn &apos;t matter whether we choose nuclear power or carbon capture and storage , upscale our biofuel production , or go for a much bigger roll-out of wind turbines and wave turbines .
contemplation , meditation , being deep in thought .
i thought i &apos;d begin with a scene of war .
and beyond all that , the chinese have this feeling in their heart of hearts and in their gut of guts that those of us in the collective west are just too damned arrogant .
so wherever you look , the message , it seems to me , is the same : that less is very often more , that slower is very often better . but that said , of course , it &apos;s not that easy to slow down , is it ?

i believe that we all have a vision for healthcare in this country .

money is not capital in most of the developing countries .
again , you can &apos;t really see much .
they do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures , many of which are similar , or even identical , to ours and formed in the same context . greeting chimpanzees embracing .
this is what it looks like .
what would you use it for ?
the second why , it starts getting difficult .
here &apos;s her daughter colony , here &apos;s her granddaughter colony , and these are her great-granddaughter colonies .
it &apos;s been very productive , that equation .
his family lost everything , and at age 11 , he had to live in motels with his dad , motels that would round up all of their food and keep it hostage until they were able to pay the bill .
independent diplomat is now established in five diplomatic centers around the world , and we &apos;re advising seven or eight different countries , or political groups , depending on how you wish to define them — and i &apos;m not big on definitions .

then i got married .
so looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design , interiors and furniture , we came up with the solution of taking an old airstream trailer and gutting it , and trying to portray laminate , and a trailer , in kind of a fresh , new contemporary look .

frankly , it &apos;s a sector that many of us who work in the field worry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology .
do we have the comparative advantage to use another sort of energy ?
and that experiment was done in northern alabama .
actually , it &apos;s not , it &apos;s actually an important social cue .
and what psychologists and behavioral economists have discovered is that by and large people use two simple rules .
and in a short period of time , the city went to a 30-year crime low .
and i wanted this guy to be involved in my crazy project , and he was kind enough to lend his image to the character of eugène spaak , who is a cosmologist and artist who seeks relation in between time , space , love , music and women .
they had fixed behaviors .
which size ? it &apos;s a piece of cake . i like challenges . which size ?
the advent of the internet definitely helped her .

( fussing ) ( laughter ) ls : so you just saw two 15-month-old babies do entirely different things based only on the probability of the sample they observed .

that &apos;s where his strength lies .
so what you suddenly started to realize — or what i started to realize — is that when you started having conversations with these companies , the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem .
fears also have plots . they have beginnings and middles and ends .
so this came out in a scientific journal a few years ago , but more importantly , it was featured on &quot; &quot; csi : miami , &quot; &quot; so you really know it &apos;s true .

now , if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons and fire into this bottle , how will those photons shatter into this bottle ?
according to burrelles , the movie premiered in january , and since then — and this isn &apos;t even the whole thing — we &apos;ve had 900 million media impressions for this film .
only together can we solve these big problems .
so we basically figured out which bones are important for us and collected their motion in 3d .
so what i &apos;m saying is that entrepreneurship is where it &apos;s at .
&quot; why don &apos;t you try ? &quot;
here &apos;s rhex entering the woods .
( laughter ) ( audio ) nr : and i &apos;m thinking , what ? that &apos;s amazing — if it &apos;s true .

that problem is solved .

pollution , global warming , these things — the consequences are distant in time and space .
it &apos;s an object that behaves like a wave , so that it doesn &apos;t just move in one direction or the other , but can follow multiple pathways at the same time .

and what we can see is that just over these few weeks , we have a much more radical change , a setback of many months of normal development , followed by a relatively rapid recovery , and by the time he reaches day 838 , which is the end of this video , you can see that he has essentially reached the healthy adult stool community , despite that antibiotic intervention .
so how might the airplane of the future look ?
as humans , ultimately being part of the universe , we &apos;re kind of the spokespeople or the observer part of the constituency of the universe .
i &apos;d encountered so much strange love , and i fell very naturally into its bewitching patterns .

there are nest maintenance workers working throughout the nest .
you didn &apos;t claim to be anything .
we don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .

family history says he loved being a fireman , and so in 1938 , on one of his days off , he elected to hang out at the firehouse .
so with very little effort , you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters , which is the same as a chinese eight-year-old .
and here is what we got .
now there &apos;s a problem there , and we &apos;ll come back to it in a minute , which is that if you bring the most powerful together to make the rules in treaty-based institutions , to fill that governance space , then what happens to the weak who are left out ?

it &apos;s nearly impossible to get paint to stick to the grease in an egg .
they &apos;re looking for answers to questions , and they want to take action when they &apos;re done , which is really hard to do from a site that looks like this .

( music : &quot; &quot; la di da di &quot; &quot; by slick rick &amp; doug e. fresh ) ( music : &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t stop &quot; &quot; by miley cyrus ) so miley cyrus , who wasn &apos;t even born yet when &quot; &quot; la di da di &quot; &quot; was made , and neither were any of the co-writers on the song , has found this song that somehow etched its way into the collective consciousness of pop music , and now , with its timeless playfulness of the original , has kind of translated to a whole new generation who will probably co-opt it as their own .
when this story was published in the washington post , i started receiving death threats , and i was forced to leave afghanistan , as my parents were .
and as i did so , i started thinking : well , what are we actually looking at here ?
so the question is : how are we all going to respond to this ?
that patient was my government .
what i dispute is the conclusion that so many people draw from them , namely that we &apos;re all screwed because the problems are unsolvable and our governments are useless .
and do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound .
but then , given the way of the world , things change .
what &apos;s trending now ? what &apos;s the popular talk now ?
there &apos;s actually a company in greece that produces these cigarettes that actually contain hemoglobin from pigs in the filter .
i can &apos;t stop this from happening .
like , thoughts and ideas go in , but none ever comes out , i mean at least not that are revealing .
or we can just leave it to fate and continue on with a business-as-usual type of attitude .
( laughter ) a few years later , i heard a joke about the greatest violinist , jascha heifetz .
what you can find there is really evidence of a lost world .
( laughter ) this is not that catchy catchphrase .
i don &apos;t think the legislation is going anywhere , because they realized it is so hard to tell the difference between a pirated design and something that &apos;s just part of a global trend .
so i mean , the reason i put those things all together , ok , here &apos;s the way you &apos;re supposed to do science — some science is done for other reasons , and just curiosity .
and those differences can be biological , physical , functional , political , cultural , socioeconomic .
and so , as we evaluated , and as the dust settled from this tragedy , we realized that , of those two problems — in the initial iteration of our organization , we were a disaster response organization that was using veteran service . we had a lot of success , and we really felt like we were changing the disaster response paradigm .
it &apos;s used to puncture through the ligaments in the spine and deliver anesthesia during childbirth .
so on the same night that barack obama won his historic presidency , the lesbian and gay community suffered one of our most painful defeats .
fast-forward , 2004 : in the peak of our activism , the minister of gender liberia called me and said , &quot; &quot; leymah , i have a nine-year-old for you .
and of course , those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society .
and he did not want to pay .
and the object is the passive no-voice .
recently , at the seattle art museum , isaac bunn and i mounted this exhibition , and the exhibition was used as a platform to launch his voice .
and one doctor said to the others , &quot; &quot; did you see my article in the new england journal of medicine ? &quot; &quot; and the other said , &quot; &quot; no . that &apos;s great . congratulations ! &quot; &quot; the next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said , &quot; &quot; well while you were , you know , doing your research , &quot; &quot; — notice the condescending tone — &quot; &quot; while you were off doing your research , i was off doing more surgeries than anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution . &quot; &quot; and the third one got the same wry smile and said , &quot; &quot; well , while you were off doing your research , and you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery ,
and over that time , i &apos;ve seen a lot of crazy things in the markets , and i &apos;ve traded a lot of crazy manias .
so what we know from this picture is that the labor supply , so people who provide labor , will go down in germany , and will go down significantly .
we gather the world &apos;s only all-female orchestra , we play fantastic music by forgotten or overlooked women composers , we have amazing conductors — it &apos;s marin alsop there from baltimore conducting , petula clark singing — and i give a lecture on women &apos;s history .
( applause ) a long time ago in a galaxy — oops , wrong script .
the car pays for itself .
but if trees can create art , if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year , if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs , then perhaps there are other static entities that we hold inside ourselves , like grief , like addictions , like racism , that can also change .
you do not have to be a professional player to get insights about movement .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
the crowd on the day of weidmann &apos;s execution was called &quot; &quot; unruly &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; disgusting &quot; &quot; by the press , but that was nothing compared to the untold thousands of people who could now study the action over and over again , freeze-framed in every detail .
so , in favor of the proposition , possibly shockingly , is one of , truly , the founders of the environmental movement , a long-standing tedster , the founder of the whole earth catalog , someone we all know and love , stewart brand .
if you look at a map of cartel influence and violence , you will see that it almost perfectly aligns with the most efficient routes of transportation from the south to the north .
october , november , december . that is not the northeast monsoon season .
you want to lose weight in a way that enhances your health rather than the one that harms it .
what are we going to do about it ? i define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity , transparency and empathy , building humanity into communications .
as one woman said , &quot; &quot; i ’ ve got 20 friends in this package of cigarettes , and they ’ re always there for me and nobody else is .
but , if not , there is now high-definition surround sound .
six thousand miles of road , 600 miles of subway track , 400 miles of bike lanes and a half a mile of tram track , if you &apos;ve ever been to roosevelt island .
i call myself a maker of things .
yours is faith .
and what we find is that there &apos;s a wide diversity of performance in the world today .
it doesn &apos;t take lots of technology or biological evolution to be able to do arbitrary computation ; just something that happens , naturally , all over the place .
so this world that we live in , this world in which every conversation has the potential to devolve into an argument , where our politicians can &apos;t speak to one another and where even the most trivial of issues have someone fighting both passionately for it and against it , it &apos;s not normal .
so very small , but very useful .
recording : ♫ hey ♫ ♫ you &apos;re okay ♫ ♫ you &apos;ll be fine ♫ zf : so that &apos;s one of the better ones , really .
( &quot; &quot; intrigue and murder among 16th century ottoman court painters . &quot; &quot; ) ( laughter ) all right , so i got a collection of the paintings together and i looked at them and i deconstructed them and i put them back together .
it said , &quot; &quot; you know , this is a car that has lots of faults .
this climber is on the last pitch of it .
the mycelium infuses all landscapes , it holds soils together , it &apos;s extremely tenacious .
the main reasons why people cooperated with the stasi were political conviction and material benefits .
and with a mobile phone , you can record a song , load it up to soundcloud and become famous .
but that made me think about collecting toys , and this thing that &apos;s going on right now in the toy world with blind box toys , and being able to collect these rare toys .
so , how do we rebuild it ?
this idea is nicely captured by this quote : &quot; &quot; things without all remedy should be without regard ; what &apos;s done is done . &quot; &quot; and it seems like kind of an admirable philosophy at first — something we might all agree to sign onto ...
but it was only when i interviewed mario moretti , the head of the red brigades , the man who kidnapped and killed aldo moro , italian former prime minister , that i finally realized that terrorism is actually business .
by 18 , under the excellent tutelage of my mother , i was therefore , as you might expect , defiantly feminist .
and i think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that , over the past couple of decades , we went from the physical world to the digital one .
could you give us the money now ?
and then , in the postwar period , you had unusually high growth rate , partly due to the reconstruction .
and a lot of people talk about trucks and moving bees , and that being bad , but we &apos;ve done that for thousands of years .
to his left is his student . she &apos;s six .
now i &apos;m going to show you what that does to our societies .
for more than 10 years , people who were charged with my care abused me physically , verbally and sexually .
and this is the project today , 12 years old , still in best condition .
this is a picture of a maternal health clinic in africa — mothers coming , pregnant and with their babies .
but what we want to propose , is that the highest levels of abstraction , things like mathematics , computing , logic , etc . — all of this can be engaged with , not just through purely cerebral algebraic symbolic methods , but by literally , physically playing with ideas .
but there are two in particular that fascinate me .
netflix — they could so easily have been content with earlier generations of distribution , but they always — and i think they will always — keep pushing for the next battle .
the city actually approached us .
and again , going on thinking about this , i realize that in a way we &apos;re all victims of a certain kind of tyranny of the triumph of modernism whereby form and function in an object have to follow one another , or are deemed to do so .
( rumbling ) so right here , these are the motor units that are happening from her spinal cord out to her muscle right here , and as she &apos;s doing it , you &apos;re seeing the electrical activity that &apos;s happening here .
one of the great ironies of modern food systems is that they &apos;ve made the very thing they promised to make easier much harder .
so for example , if someone said , &quot; &quot; my likelihood of suffering from cancer is about 50 percent , &quot; &quot; and we said , &quot; &quot; hey , good news .
but one of them carlos ghosn , ceo of renault and nissan , when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating .
the rest , almost 500,000 people , are dying outside of conflict zones .
you can give yourself your morning pleasures in various languages .
( guitar music starts ) ( music ends ) ( applause ) ( distorted guitar music starts ) ( music ends ) ( applause ) ( ambient / guitar music starts ) ( music ends ) ( applause )
&#91; the &#93; tasmanian devil is found only on the island of tasmania , which is that small island just to the south of the mainland of australia .
and so i wonder if we should just take a leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things .
the challenge here , though , is that the popular men and women are sticking to 97 words on average that are written very , very well , even though it may not seem like it all the time .
the evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species , at particular times of the year .
let me show you some examples .
but , using the language of galois , we can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things are actually the same .
so i don &apos;t know what the balance is , but i think sharks have more right to be fearful of us than we have of them .
i think in some ways , the reason i started the project , even though i didn &apos;t know it at the time , was because i was struggling with my own secrets .
but what does it mean ? how does it impact on our everyday life ?
i mean , in that circumstance , couldn &apos;t you argue that what he did was reasonable ?
you have to be willing to take those risks .
and then we divide it , and this one big piece of dough is divided into smaller units , and each of those units are given shape by the baker .
but the real issue is there &apos;s no food at home .
i didn &apos;t know ted then , but what i did was i closed my eyes tight , and i started dreaming . i could imagine people coming in , dressed up , looking beautiful , my paintings with all the light , and in my visualization i actually saw a very famous actress launching my show , giving credibility to me .
that &apos;s why , when we launched photos on twitter , we made the decision to strip that geodata out .
well , you have to let me say this .
it is , as steven johnson has talked about , an emergent phenomenon .
but i don &apos;t always know the degree to which a changing context ...
if that is true , it leads to some very complicated questions for the london olympics .
it is a structure for maintain , for centuries , by generations , without any department , without any funding , so the secret is &quot; &quot; &#91; unclear &#93; , &quot; &quot; respect .
you can see the united states ahead of everyone else , and much of the economic success of the united states draws on its long-standing advantage as the first mover in education .
so for example , if your date is smiling at you , this technology can help you to determine whether she actually likes you or she is just trying to be nice to you .
imagine being able to — and , again , it &apos;s a templated process , and it solidifies out of a liquid process — imagine being able to have that sort of structure coming out at room temperature .
where do we come up with these ideas ?
twenty-three years ago , at the age of 19 , i shot and killed a man .
so it &apos;s common — don &apos;t expect to be out of here in 10 minutes .
so presently , we are doing the following : first of all , we are decomposing the k-12 math curriculum into numerous such apps .
therefore , ending poverty is simply a matter of delivering proven goods and services to people .
it &apos;s structured , so it ends up being simple to remember , and it &apos;s okay to break it here and there .
they live in groups with a very strict social hierarchy .
we &apos;re born to make a difference .
first rule : there is no clan distinguished and political division in somali society .
what do i mean by these two different forces ?
they bring the medicines up from the pharmacy .
she &apos;s trying to force-feed my camera , which is every photographer &apos;s dream .
saparmurat niyazov , he was one of them .
he &apos;d been expecting me . mohamed had phoned .
but we should be getting out there ourselves and not depending on large institutions to do it for us .
this is the lowland tapir , the tapir species i work with , the largest terrestrial mammal of south america .
and finally , point number three : whatever one wants to say about lesterland , against the background of its history , its traditions , in our land , in usa-land , lesterland is a corruption , a corruption .
it turned out , as i think you could see in aimee &apos;s capabilities and attitudes , people with a desire to do something are quite remarkable and nature is quite adaptable .
i used the three bs of stand-up don &apos;ts as i call them in the middle east : blue content , keep it clean ; beliefs , not religion ; and the third b , bolitics .
so what they did is they — i mean , they put csi to shame here — the internet detectives came out .
( video ) ( laughs ) you are peaceful people .
so the challenge was — i worked for microsoft for a little bit , working on the microsoft barney .
but no , i wasn &apos;t born there .
on the other hand , i didn &apos;t know anything about this . ok ?
and i know how we got here .
and as a result of this program , something &apos;s happening for conservation .
you turn up the dials , the wheel starts to turn .
come the one year anniversary of my journey , i went to see my surgeon , dr. john healey — and by the way , healey , great name for a doctor .
and maybe if we all tried to read our fears , we too would be less often swayed by the most salacious among them .
when we think about working memory , we have to realize that this limited capacity has lots of different impacts on us .
this is why we decided to take the operation undercover when necessary , and use mostly hidden cameras .
was the internet actually a place that you could visit ?
it &apos;s called hutchinson-gilford progeria , and it is the most dramatic form of premature aging .
and when we solve real problems for people , we solve them for the rest of the world at the same time .
am i out of time ? ok .
and when i began looking into these cases , i was wondering , where do these bizarre memories come from ?
that the reason that you want to be below two watts is that &apos;s roughly what you can generate with your upper body .
if your bank account &apos;s one dollar , and you flip a single bit , you could end up with a thousand dollars .
we really have no idea .
i was so determined to be a teacher now so that i could make a difference in my family .
and we can use that same pulse , now applied to the rtpj , to ask if we can change people &apos;s moral judgments .
we , as i &apos;ve said , have got to hit that market , but we &apos;ve got to use our heads rather than our might .
you do some routine refresher training , and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you .
they want to get out .
i was on bowman lake in glacier national park , which is a long , skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it , and my partner and i have a rowing shell .
and we owe a tremendous credit to that .
when they were sick , we would collect specimens from them .
video : now she comes up to dr. sue and starts writing again .
we have a process where we , you know , kind of put it into the computer and digitize it , and then a whole lot of analysis .
of course , the accuracy keeps getting worse .
resurrection is possible .
so they &apos;re all well documented deviations from rational behavior .
i was going to say , i had a great social experience when i went to college that i hadn &apos;t had before , a more fraternal experience , where i met six or seven other guys who i studied physics with , and i was very competitive with them , so then i started to get a &apos;s . but you &apos;re right : i wasn &apos;t an a student .
he realized at once what had happened .
so we were looking at how we could make a power station , that , instead of keeping people out and having a big fence around the outside , could be a place that pulls you in .
so what we have to do , i think , is invent a new kind of agriculture that blends the best ideas of commercial agriculture and the green revolution with the best ideas of organic farming and local food and the best ideas of environmental conservation , not to have them fighting each other but to have them collaborating together to form a new kind of agriculture , something i call &quot; &quot; terraculture , &quot; &quot; or farming for a whole planet .
and those three verses are the core of authenticity .
the battery is not the gas tank , in a sense .
this baby is a human body : it evolved .
one of the reasons is a lot of their telephones use ip protocol and use things like skype and so on that go through the internet right now , and so in fact we &apos;re becoming dependent on it for more and more different things , like when you take off from lax , you &apos;re really not thinking you &apos;re using the internet .
it was that the nobel prize was the tombstone on all great work , and it resonated because i had won 35 out of 36 contests that i &apos;d entered over 11 years , and it made me bananas .
but five years ago , i went on a personal journey .
&quot; &quot; you &apos;ve never really been sure of this , but i can assure you that this quirk you &apos;re so self-conscious of is intensely endearing .
but that is clearly insufficient to address the needs of the people and address the needs of the countries that are supporting the people .
now , pay transparency takes a lot of forms .
and we also have some terrific women who are writing new stories for our kids , and as three-dimensional and delightful as hermione and katniss are , these are still war movies .
this is not about money .
but if you grow up in an area like this , you see affirmative action as a tool to hold people like you back .
so during the chicago mayoral election there was a parody account .
some of you would eat it only if it &apos;s a strangely colored piece of tofu .
if they &apos;re talking about having lost a family member , don &apos;t start talking about the time you lost a family member .
it &apos;s great to be a kid .
so by trying to preserve our dead bodies , we deny death , poison the living and further harm the environment .
and so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open .
it is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult , expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks , and doing that with a local resource , plenty available .
so , we study the holistic health experience of 1,000 seniors over the last 10 years in 20 different countries .
and we call that the meme-ome .
we organized into cities . we had many people .
i can &apos;t feel the wind here , but i just asked one of the caretakers who passed by what it felt like , and she said it felt warm , like melted butter .
so production and comprehension rely on very similar processes .
so each chain , or each element , wants to turn right or left .
long steps . so a lot of milongueros — the tango dancers will use very short steps .
to illustrate these mindsets in action , i &apos;m going to take you back to 19th-century france , where this innocuous-looking piece of paper launched one of the biggest political scandals in history .
one way of asking them the question is like this : &quot; &quot; others in similar circumstances have thought about ending their life ; have you had these thoughts ? &quot; &quot; confronting the person head-on may just save their life and be the turning point for them .
so there can be some biologists , psychiatrists , mathematicians , and so on .
this is what the code on your phone looks like , but this is what the code on your computer looks like .
and i lied .
only 18 percent of italians and 15 percent of greeks believe that their vote matters .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard about it — newspapers ?
not just in the streets , but in their homes , at school and at work .
to whom do you speak at least once a week , be it face to face or on facetime ?
i thought that was a pretty big deal .
but the people of the middle east have been deprived of any form of what we know as civic education .
one area is called experimental economics . the other area is called behavioral economics .
and we need preparedness .
and the chinese character for crisis is actually the same side of the same coin .
it is a struggle to try and live a life that is set by the moral codes written in the koran .
i &apos;m not alone , and i am loved .
there is no area of the government — not the epa or the fda — that controls genetically-engineered pets .
and you might be thinking that it was good luck , but it wasn &apos;t .
thank you very much .
that &apos;s it . the task is finished . &quot; &quot; so , now we had a student — an acting student — that was a part of the group .
we want every girl to experience the dance , right ? &quot; &quot; so the girls thought for a moment , and one girl suggested , &quot; why don &apos;t we just take the dance in the jail ? &quot;
we stand today on the threshold of the post-antibiotic era , in the earliest days of a time when simple infections such as the one joe had will kill people once again .
they came up with the very same rules that we had , except they &apos;re theirs .
let me talk about something a little technical for a moment here .
but i don &apos;t want to take responsibility of your emotional baggage .
there was not a flashlight , not a lantern , not a candle — pitch black .
we can tell in the operating room , in the field , at a molecular level , where is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do and how much more work they need to do to cut that out .
what would it look like if there was an easy pathway for the very entrepreneurs and innovators who have disrupted our tech sector to come and disrupt their government ?
when you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms , at first it &apos;s very bizarre .
if you are surrounding yourself with the right people , they will not only get it , they will appreciate it .
but getting this out is one of the things we want to do .
in fact , the winners have to pay their own way to come to the ig nobel ceremony , which most of them do .
that &apos;s where she has to pull herself out from the depths of mortality , come in , release her spirit .
with the patient insensitive to pain , and a sterile operating field all bets were off , the sky was the limit .
of more concern , i think , is the asteroids that exist between mars and jupiter .
first , we need strong health systems in poor countries .
you know , you have new diseases that require new drugs .
we &apos;ve got to start thinking about asking people to retire a little bit later .
is there a way to know ?
it was an act of kindness .
i had fun again , i worked harder and , to cut a long story short , did all the things that took me back up to success .
i imagine a whole world of surrogate donors from all walks of life , different sizes , different ages , coming together in this voice drive to give people voices that are as colorful as their personalities .
so , we &apos;ve become one of the hot , young jazz recording studios in the united states of america ( laughter ) in the middle of the inner city with a high crime rate .
listen to this : less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treated stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment .
but i think it &apos;s insane to believe that we will ever make a society that is genuinely meritocratic ; it &apos;s an impossible dream .
i want to quote this guy — the guy in robes , not the other guy — the dalai lama , who said , &quot; &quot; if you want others to be happy , practice compassion .
and this material that &apos;s deposited either starts as a liquid form or a material powder form .
but look what happened in europe after the plague : rising wages , land reform , technological innovation , birth of the middle class ; and after that , forward-looking social movements like the renaissance , and later the enlightenment .
or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere .
look what happened by 2000 to the average call .
and they actually lived another 14 days , or 28 when we finally killed them , and took them apart and figured out what went wrong .
this proved that anonymous and this idea can rally the masses from the keyboards to the streets , and it laid the foundations for dozens of future operations against perceived injustices to their online and offline world .
not so much different from us , they can use plants to treat their intestinal parasites .
evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment .
just think of people at a checkout line or at a red light .
and so the citizen scientists , when they saw this , they notified the science team that they found something weird enough that it might be worth following up .
it turns out that women are really driving the social media revolution .
that would be very boring .
in fact , i am a data nerd .
one of the key qualities of all stories is that they &apos;re made to be shared .
last week , guardian art critic blah blah suggested that games cannot qualify as art . but is he right ?
the beginning is now only a handful of years away , and i predict that autonomous vehicles will permanently change our world over the next several decades .
this we can do .
we all got down onto the ice , and i then got into my swimming costume and i dived into the sea .
we were to be below the radar , so there was no communication , really , between bageye and us and us and bageye , and the sound that we most looked forward to , you know when you &apos;re a child and you want your father to come home and it &apos;s all going to be happy and you &apos;re waiting for that sound of the door opening .
( laughter ) so the next day , just before the event , i called don .
our arteries can clog . our brains can gunk up with plaque , and we can get alzheimer &apos;s .
( laughter ) and i thought , no — i &apos;m going to find the game .
( laughter ) asking for your bank details .
what you see here is a madly swarming mass of particles , each of which represents a single human feeling that was stated in the last few hours .
( laughter ) from jerusalem to america by boat in 600 bc ? &quot; &quot; and they said , &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) then they told me how lehi and his descendants reproduced and reproduced , and over the course of 600 years , there were two great races of them , the nephites and the lamanites , and the nephites were totally good — each and every one of them — and the lamanites were totally bad and evil — every single one of them just bad to the bone .
in fact — ( applause ) thank you .
and you know what my response to all of that is ?
( laughter ) it &apos;s all i got . ( laughs ) so , in this suburb , the poo and the pee and the wash water are going to this treatment plant right in the middle of the community .
under normal sentencing procedures , judge russell would have had little choice but to sentence pettengill to serious jail-time as a drug felon .
my home is not far from the brooklyn bridge , and during the year and a half i was on crutches , it became a sort of symbol to me .
and so we had spelling bees in paris , illinois .
and to do this does not require a constitutional amendment , changing the first amendment .
( laughter ) summer vacations often consisted of my father trying to heal me , so i drank deer &apos;s milk , i had hot cups on my back , i was dunked in the dead sea , and i remember the water burning my eyes and thinking , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s working ! it &apos;s working ! &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) but one miracle cure we did find was yoga .
let &apos;s hear what jeff han has to say about this newfangled technology .
and then finally , there &apos;s how the system can handle uncertainty .
the effect of this has been that , within the first year , we really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served , which is over 50,000 people .
mcintyre wrote about this and it was read by the editor of high times magazine .
they were screaming .
now , when john f. kennedy sent a man to the moon and decided to bring him back , or decided to do both those things , he didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; hey , whenever you guys get to it . &quot; &quot; he gave us a deadline .
time for development — it took around 10 years and 700 million dollars .
i think all schools could use extra equipment , extra cash — it &apos;s going to be an incentive for them to do that .
perhaps even worse is when it finds its way into our oceans , like in the great plastic gyre , where these materials are being mechanically broken into smaller and smaller bits , but they &apos;re not really going away .
that &apos;s quite a lot .
our instinct as parents is to order our kids around .
as a little girl , i always imagined i would one day run away .
it just came on the scene three years ago .
why do we dance together ?
and the great thing is there &apos;s no trick like with the glass ceiling .
in fact , no , education spending should not be cut .
so one approach we ’ re taking is to try to design drugs that function like molecular scotch tape , to hold the protein into its proper shape .
what rises twice a year , once in easter and then two weeks before christmas , has a mini peak every monday , and then flattens out over the summer ?
maybe it &apos;s going to rain .
i mean , we want to build frameworks in a way that makes it acceptable and makes it productive down the road .
and this is a little bit freaky , because what motts is seeing is actually this .
in theory , this means we could restore hundreds of native species that have been pushed to the brink .
i signed up for something called the personal genome project .
you want button fly or zipper fly ? you want stonewashed or acid-washed ?
we developed a theory called &quot; &quot; dragon-kings . &quot; &quot; dragon-kings represent extreme events which are of a class of their own .
reclaiming yourself can be one of the most gorgeous acts of self-love and can look like a million different things , from hairstyles to tattoos to body contouring to hormones to surgery and yes , even weight loss .
karl marx saw this as the tragedy of capitalism , the alienation of the worker from the product of his labor .
and i &apos;m not suggesting that we do , but the bottom line is , we &apos;ve always had alternatives .

and every culture comes up with its own understanding of life , its own customized version of mythology .
the doorbell rang and it was a trick-or-treater dressed as my character . it was so cool .
and because the probability of me throwing it just right is very low , given everybody watching me , what we &apos;re going to do instead is show you a video that we shot last night .

ok . now , children get their ideas not from teachers , as teachers often think , but actually from common sense , from experience of the world around them , from all the things that go on between them and their peers , and their carers , and their parents , and all of that . experience .

and it &apos;s not a special effects film ; it has to be a man .
but if you take that logic , you know , you should consider life unfair , because the test of truth in life is not whether we can remember what we learned in school , but whether we are prepared for change , whether we are prepared for jobs that haven &apos;t been created , to use technologies that haven &apos;t been invented , to solve problems we just can &apos;t anticipate today .

neither can attack the other , because to attack the other side you &apos;ve got to come down the mountain into the valley and then up the other side , and you &apos;re completely exposed .
so we have created a very disruptive structure which mimics the design of bone , or a skeleton , which occurs in nature .
much of the road congestion in and out of our cities will disappear .
on up to iceland .
i don ’ t know of any other submersible , or even remote , that just takes advantage that this is a three-dimensional space .
here on the model you see the predator attacking .
i &apos;m talking about losing it in the same way that we lost the dinosaurs : actually losing it , never to be seen again .

the publication of those images , as opposed to the images themselves , caused a government to change its policies .

while we humans , we are happy in our comfort zone , these plants also need their ecosystem to be preserved , and they don &apos;t react — endemic plants don &apos;t react to very harsh changes in their ecosystem , and yet we know what are the challenges that climate change , for example , is posing to these plants .
my funeral home sells a few caskets made out of things like woven willow and bamboo , but honestly , most of our families just choose a simple shroud .
now hold your breath , not too long , to imagine what comes next .
i &apos;d say , watch any successful well-written , family-friendly sitcom in the west for your answers .
that &apos;s actually not so bad . if you go back to the carter and even reagan administrations , they were rating the other party 43 , 45 . it &apos;s not terrible .
getting the cause and the effect right makes all the difference in the world .
and what we &apos;re doing with them is taking a traditional race-car chassis and giving it a nervous system .
what &apos;s your hope / depression level on this ?
we need to get away from feeling , in the same way , human rights matters because of the other things it brings , or women &apos;s rights matters for the other things it brings .
and i started to fall .
and you &apos;re kind of trapped in the texture of kymaerica .
as a result , they can &apos;t improve on others &apos; ideas or learn from others &apos; mistakes — benefit from others &apos; wisdom .
truly extraordinary altruists &apos; compassion extends way beyond that circle , even beyond their wider circle of acquaintances to people who are outside their social circle altogether , total strangers , just like the man who rescued me .

and i think we can go and use our technology to go and digitize things , put them on the net , and then download , print them and bind them , and end up with books again .
any event that happens anywhere in the world , i should be able to know about it pretty much instantaneously , as it happens , for free .
and how much will they pay for this ?
and it &apos;s not based on theology or philosophy , it &apos;s in the study of the mind , across all these spheres of research , from neuroscience to the cognitive scientists , behavioral economists , psychologists , sociology , we &apos;re developing a revolution in consciousness .
all right ? anybody else like that , no ?
that &apos;s it , thank you .
100 years later .
i can &apos;t tell you when this will start , because i don &apos;t want my competition to know my schedule .
so the oyster was the basis for a manifesto-like urban design project that i did about the new york harbor called &quot; &quot; oyster-tecture . &quot; &quot; and the core idea of oyster-tecture is to harness the biological power of mussels , eelgrass and oysters — species that live in the harbor — and , at the same time , harness the power of people who live in the community towards making change now .
like one of the ways to understand our greenhouse future is to drill down in time to the last period where we had co2 double what it is today .
he &apos;s not quite a child , and he &apos;s not quite a man .
that &apos;s a very powerful idea , and it &apos;s a very powerful reality .

i didn &apos;t know what was the war for .
good news : chariot &apos;s coming . good news : chariot &apos;s coming .
and after a few years , you can remove some of those shade trees .
embarrassed , the animals fled , and that was the last time they revealed themselves this way .
and if you were going to fight orcs on the fields of mordor against the ra &apos;s al ghul , you &apos;d probably want to be the bigger one , right ?
but along with the scientific challenge and the economic challenge , there &apos;s also a cultural challenge , and this is probably the part about malaria that people don &apos;t like to talk about .
so what is happening ?
right around d-day , bonica showed up to madigan army medical center , near tacoma .
here &apos;s the mystery , then : how do we actually make these polymer chains inside the brain so we can move all the biomolecules apart ?

but as early as 1968 , this visionary man , robert kennedy , at the start of his ill-fated presidential campaign , gave the most eloquent deconstruction of gross national product that ever has been .
it &apos;s also the great theoretical triumph of biology .
but this time , i was the patient .
and this work corrects that bias in our culture , that dehumanizing bias .
a single cave system , like mammoth cave , which is in kentucky , can be as long as more than 600 kilometers .
mahmood ali balogun : i think filmmaking in nigeria , for those who work in it , is a kind of subsistence filmmaking — what they do to make a living .

for the hundred or so countries that are ranked below china , more than half of them are electoral democracies .
i didn &apos;t know who she was , and she said , &quot; &quot; did you get george abbott to talk ? &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; yeah . apparently i did . &quot; &quot; and she said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m his old girlfriend , maureen stapleton , and i could never do it . &quot; &quot; and then she made me go up with the tape of it and prove that george abbott actually could talk .
he wrote that , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radical acts like the brain of one of the lower animals . &quot; &quot; this is not a metaphor .
face 2 face demonstrated that what we thought impossible was possible — and , you know what , even easy .
on october 7 , he calls his cousin in belgium , and explains his situation .
so what does it mean to design at a global scale ?
what i &apos;m going to do is look at five categories of experiments , each of which challenges an old assumption of philanthropy .

we were totally dependent during those years on this amazing acronym , which is mad .
the rest of you , you will grow older and you will get two billion children .
they &apos;ve funded research that shows that we can double global palm oil production without cutting a single tree in the next 20 years , and do it all in borneo alone by planting on land that &apos;s already degraded .
we can track these changes , and have tracked these changes in many such behaviors across time .
so , clearly , we were in a substantially better place for this .
they &apos;re probably going to be angry , depressed , frustrated .
and one of the things i really like about gardening is that it doesn &apos;t take all your concentration , you really can &apos;t get hurt — it &apos;s not like woodworking — and you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation .
and here &apos;s what i found : most people are worrying about the wrong thing .
so let me just explain to you that the smartest man ever was a scotsman .

i &apos;m going to talk to you now about the elephant rather than the camel in the room .
yeah , so seeds that could save your life . you know ?
i &apos;m watching who &apos;s watching me .
you know , the spanish didn &apos;t sink the battleship maine , the lusitania was not an innocent vessel but was loaded with munitions , the north vietnamese did not attack the seventh fleet , and , of course , saddam hussein hated al qaeda and had nothing to do with it , and yet the administration convinced 45 percent of the people that they were brothers in arms , when he would hang one from the nearest lamppost .
and when i came back , i had to give them a lot of gratitude and praise because they showed me that they truly had my back and that they truly had their own backs .
it &apos;s like the old maxim of &quot; &quot; you can tell somebody something and show them , but if they do it they really learn it . &quot; &quot; here is another thing you can do .
we had heard this story about lost gold from a gold rush-era robbery , and we wanted to go up there .
now i &apos;m going to close with a video that is kind of unusual .

we could test the safety of chemicals that we are exposed to on a daily basis in our environment , such as chemicals in regular household cleaners .
the first thought is that , hey , you know there &apos;s somebody somewhere out there playing some music , and this is a small but i think important human connection to make that perhaps the technology affords .

taiwan succeeded , china under mao zedong didn &apos;t .
here are three sets of firing patterns . the top one is from a normal animal , the middle one is from a blind animal that &apos;s been treated with this encoder-transducer device , and the bottom one is from a blind animal treated with a standard prosthetic .
here &apos;s another one : &quot; &quot; sorry i didn &apos;t respond to you earlier .
and so i asked jawad , &quot; &quot; how do you guys navigate ? this is a really diverse community .

if not , well , this is the hardest problem perhaps in science and philosophy .
it listens to the lecture , and then it uses the amplitude of each word to move a point on the x-axis , and it uses the inflection of sentences to move a same point up and down on the y-axis .
transistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen , and technology has really benefitted from that .
if you want to change the world , you have to group together , you have to be collaborative .

this is why politics is so tribal .

this little thing says here : five times what nasa &apos;s doing by 2020 . i want to tell you , already there &apos;s about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion investment in private space flight that is not government at all — already , worldwide . if you read — if you google it , you &apos;ll find about half of that money , but there &apos;s twice of that being committed out there — not spent yet , but being committed and planned for the next few years . hey , that &apos;s pretty big .
we can easily resign to the fact or to the thinking that government is too inefficient , too corrupt , unfixable .

so luckily , the science — no , sorry — the marketing is getting easier .
well , after years of working toward a climate agreement , the same governments convened in copenhagen and failed miserably .
it &apos;s just because people are uncomfortable with the idea , and that &apos;s why i want you today to try to think about this , think about the benefits of bees in cities and why they really are a terrific thing .
that &apos;s kind of too much effort .

one of the big ideas , one of the big projects i &apos;ve been honored to work on is a new website . and i would encourage you all to please go to it .

the second characteristic component of regret is a sense of bewilderment .

so what we do is concrete things , and we translate technical issues into citizen language to show that citizens have a role to play and can play it together .
just because you don &apos;t see it , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s not there .
the fbi began to indict officials at fifa , the organization that controls the world of professional soccer .
that &apos;s very bad news for local indigenous people living downstream who are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates .
here &apos;s an example of one such text .
if i &apos;m cooking , the door is shut , the kids are out , the phone &apos;s on the hook , if she comes in i get annoyed .

( laughter ) but what makes our experiences perhaps a little bit different and a little more unique than that of the average person is that we have this gnawing thing in the back of our mind that even in our darkest moments , and those times of despair , we think , &quot; &quot; hey , there might be an image to be made here , there might be a story to be told . &quot; &quot; and why is storytelling important ?
but there &apos;s also a certain beauty within this technology .
people who happened to be women didn &apos;t have the same rights , couldn &apos;t vote .
visible light has a wavelength , a size , that &apos;s much smaller than the things around you , the features on people &apos;s faces , the size of your cell phone .
it turns out , when you add mobility — the ability to roll around the table — you get a little more of a boost .
so if you take , say , natural gas , which is the most prevalent hydrocarbon source fuel , if you burn that in a modern general electric natural gas turbine , you &apos;ll get about 60 percent efficiency .
and this problem is : where are the plants ?
it evolves .
it &apos;s a very holistic way of improving the lives of the people living in the villages around the park .
some of it even came from lianas , those things that dangle in the middle of the jungle .
and then it &apos;s a high savings rate .
no , i &apos;m not even going to look up . no . &quot; &quot; to understand why this is happening to us , and what we can do about it , we need to learn more about moral psychology .
but not all the vessels have those to date .
and they decided to tell me that i could see .
tm : ok , now for all the talking , and inspiring , and possibility-modeling we &apos;ve done , we &apos;ve been nowhere near perfect .
fatah , hamas and the popular front !
what happens right now , though , is that we have this mixing airflow pattern .
and i wanted to see — i want to dedicate this film to my father , homer .
haryana is a state which has 30 million people .
the idea is that , with free electricity , they will no longer have to use firewood to cook their food .
so , i was going to throw some condoms in the room and whatnot , but i &apos;m not sure it &apos;s the etiquette here .
well i don &apos;t have time to tell you about all the mathematics , but underlying this is the social networks , because this is a universal phenomenon .
and we &apos;ve never looked back .
it started out in the &apos; 80s , but at the beginning it was machines carving out of a foam block a model that was very , very fragile , and could not have any real use .
this was a brain that paid its dues .
in spite of what some people in the press don &apos;t get it , didn &apos;t understand it , we didn &apos;t take it off because we didn &apos;t want to do — having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want .
they do this with their toes . it &apos;s bizarre ! this peeling inspired irobot — that we work with — to build mecho-geckos .
we have this war with iran coming for 10 years now , and we have people , you know , afraid .
bringing up three children when you &apos;re the world &apos;s richest family seems like a social experiment without much prior art .
( singing ) ( laughter ) and i took a high-speed video of my throat while i was humming .
all right , so you get your little tutorial right there .
and it &apos;s expanding .
i was a misfit .
within 12 hours , i was horribly sunburned , just like richard dreyfuss in the movie .
the stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter .
all right , let me show you some more about this .
this is clara , a famous rhinoceros that was traveling europe in the mid-1700s , at a time when seeing a rhino was an exciting rarity .
i am a leader , so i know i cannot do anything alone .
but we know that occasionally ants go astray , and what happens is that , if army ants are wandering around and they get lost , they start to follow a simple rule — just do what the ant in front of you does .
salmon is a carnivore , it has no way to digest soy .
this is where we want to get , though , in the next three years .
all right , i can see a rhinovirus — and here &apos;s the blow-up of the rhinovirus &apos;s little barcode — but what about different rhinoviruses ?
they were delighted , and by the time it was time to go see the principal , whom they &apos;d actually come to see — not the computer room — they went upstairs and they said , &quot; &quot; this is absolutely remarkable !
of course , there are the bases , which refer to specific sexual activities that happen in a very specific order , ultimately resulting in scoring a run or hitting a home run , which is usually having vaginal intercourse to the point of orgasm , at least for the guy .
so as a great physicist once said , there &apos;s these little upstream eddies of biology that create order in this rapid torrent of entropy .
people look at the roads , for example , and they &apos;d say , &quot; angola : 90 percent of roads are untarred . ah , problem ! &quot;
this is sea-monkeys .
uncontacted peoples hold a mystical and iconic role in our imagination .
let &apos;s journey together . let &apos;s journey together .
the way we do that , i believe , is at the level of the city .
we &apos;re the ones who have to do it .
so you just get a bigger and bigger ball of whatever that is mixed with your tears on your eye until eventually , the ball becomes so big that the surface tension takes it across the bridge of your nose like a tiny little waterfall and goes &quot; &quot; goosh &quot; &quot; into your other eye , and now i was completely blind outside the spaceship .
so next time you &apos;re talking to a stranger and you feel comfortable , tell them something true about yourself , something really personal .
other places , gmo is saving the world .
but think again . why should that be always the case ?
but then along came the industrial revolution , and then goods became the predominant economic offering , where we used commodities as a raw material to be able to make or manufacture goods .
and it &apos;s viewed in those sort of idealistic terms .
i work with really amazing , little , itty-bitty creatures called cells .
( laughter ) and when the crisis was happening , the head of quantitative equities at lehman brothers said , &quot; &quot; events which models predicted would happen once every 10,000 years happened every day for three days . &quot; &quot; so , it &apos;s extraordinary . it &apos;s a new world that &apos;s very , very difficult to make sense of .
now what i like about this video is it &apos;s actually a video of the first time they ever danced together because of his lead . he had a strong lead .
i graduated .
and at the same time , you have a number that you can call to get more information on commuting , or a low-interest loan on a different kind of car , or whatever it is you &apos;re going to need to actually reduce your gasoline dependence .
so now we faced , you know , a little bit of a problem here .
tattoo was , at one time , a kind of a blacklisted or con thing , but now it is in thing .
so if you put these physiological processes to work , i &apos;d hypothesize that it might be our increased intake of refined grains , sugars and starches that &apos;s driving this epidemic of obesity and diabetes , but through insulin resistance , you see , and not necessarily through just overeating and under-exercising .
so i immediately decided , this is going to be the name of the game , or my new exclamation .
so this morning i &apos;m going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand .
i &apos;m just the same as everybody else . &quot; &quot; and i think that &apos;s actually a really telling answer , because it suggests that the circles of these altruists don &apos;t look like this , they look more like this .
it &apos;s almost as though most of gravity has gone missing .
he makes us the subject of his art .
so , it &apos;s about choosing the parts of the bible about compassion , about tolerance , about loving your neighbor , as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin , or intolerance , or violence , which are very much in the bible as well .
plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cooling load by a third .
or if they do have our interests at heart , we worry that they don &apos;t know us well enough to figure out what they need to do in order to allow us to secure those interests .
( applause ) thank you . thank you very much . thank you . thank you very much .
i had a lot of journalists calling me , asking me , &quot; &quot; which is the test they &apos;re going to run that will tell us whether or not caster semenya is male or female ? &quot; &quot; and i had to explain to the journalists there isn &apos;t such a test .
look into those eyes . i &apos;m not able to focus those eyes .
and there are a lot of other problems with that . it &apos;s very hard to do .
but you will remain one of the most important superpowers , and the most hopeful superpower , for the time to be .
in a primitive and simple world , there &apos;s really no reason for a model because feeling is close to reality .
i could get you admitted right away , and the whole thing could be very discrete . &apos; &apos; ha , ha , ha .
you cannot say it &apos;s a mere treatment 10,000 dollars , but because you are poor i &apos;ll give it for 9,000 .
redemption songs .
the physicians of the ancient world — especially the egyptians , who started medicine as we know it — were very conscious of what they could and couldn &apos;t treat .
and if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks , it &apos;s worth 100 bucks no matter what you &apos;re saving it on . people don &apos;t think that way .
they tend to be creative . they tend to be entrepreneurial .
we &apos;re not interested in your help . &quot; &quot; and he threw me out of the room .
what i find amazing is that africa is transcending its geography problem .
and it turns out that as we called around to the independent crash test companies around the country , none of them wanted to do our crash test because they said , some explicitly , some not so explicitly , &quot; &quot; all of our business comes from car seat manufacturers .
now , similarly , in locke ’ s society there are individuals who have certain rights , properties in a formal sense , and those are defined with respect to some absolute , abstract notions of rights and justice , and so forth , which are independent of what else has happened in the society .
these are survival skills .
and indeed , i think , rather than being annihilated , the performing arts are poised on the brink of a time when we will be more important than we have ever been .
now , we &apos;re all here to dream , but maybe if we &apos;re honest about it , each of us chasing our own dream .
this is due to the attraction and the repulsion of the individual particles inside the liquid .
we &apos;re going to speak now to the operations center .
then we made these legs that are cast in soil with a potato root system growing in them , and beetroots out the top , and a very lovely brass toe .
but i &apos;m obsessive , so i couldn &apos;t just stop there , so i actually started modifying the bunks where you could actually slide out the bunks and slide in desks or shelving , so the same unit can now be used for an office or storage location .
well , ultimately , it could mean that you could print your own medicine .
it was , what i would say , compositional complexity , and i felt that if i had to fulfill what i talked about — a building for science — there had to be some kind of a generating idea , some kind of a generating geometry .
they said , we won &apos;t think about it until we know it &apos;s right .
rb : philippe is quite erratic , so i think that he wouldn &apos;t be the best person to design the engine , no .
so we were the first to actually name a bird from the famous series that later exploded onto the pages of science and nature .
well before i go any further , this is something worth sharing .
and there was something very moving about all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky .
well , i finally decided i needed to lose weight , and i knew i could because i &apos;d done it so many times before , so i simply stopped eating as much .
and if you &apos;re in the half-mile radius of where this bomb went off , you have a 90 percent chance of not making it .
and when i started out , i was just using these blue duct-tape filters over my strobe , so i could make sure i &apos;m actually seeing the light that &apos;s being transformed by the animals .
we need more than that . where do we draw the line ?
some of us have a burglar alarm system at home , and some of us don &apos;t .
he saw that first glint of light — he knew what the weather was going to be three days from now .
we might even call them citizens , because they &apos;ve recently risen up to fight against legislative incursion , and the citizens of these networks work together to serve each other in great ways .
a plant , quite simply , needs light , it needs co2 , but even more importantly , it needs nutrients , which it draws from the soil .
i remember one day , it was a very hot day in the spring , and we hadn &apos;t been in a fight in a couple of weeks , maybe .
obviously that doesn &apos;t work very well for — ca : what just happened there ? we just saw something land ?
they hatched out in india .
so what we need is space inside the aircraft , inside a very dense area .
now , would that this were just about sarah palin and her reality tv show .
and i learned a new word last week .
and hence , the enormous role that a marine protected area can play .
he &apos;s standing the watch in helmand , in southern afghanistan .
many had undiagnosed conditions like multiple sclerosis , epilepsy , brain tumors .
i can &apos;t forget auntie .
you get divided , and a continent &apos;s division corresponds to a fork in the evolutionary tree , or you &apos;re crafty , and you manage to escape from one to the other and erase that division , or you &apos;re living peacefully on each side , and on one side you just go extinct , and you survive on the other side and create a difference .
make a decision and give me some blood .
i don &apos;t want him killed . i know he &apos;s going to love cliffs .
and her voice was the most powerful voice .
yeah . jack — you &#91; unclear &#93; with jack ? jack
but as i sat there for four hours , the full afternoon , reading maslow , i recognized something that is true of most leaders .
because , you know , most people , when they hear that i predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more , they think that i &apos;m saying that we &apos;re going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more .
you know about objects and their properties .
where do you see your doctor and your dentist ? &quot; &quot; then i &apos;m very much of the united states , and i have been for 48 years now , since i was a really small child .
but a lot of times , whole categories of innovation — ones that can help us live more beautifully — turn out to be illegal .
they wouldn &apos;t go listen to him .
no democracy anywhere in the world offers this feature to its citizens for either legislation or for budgets , even though those are the things done with our consent and with our money .
and he was soon controlling huge servers around the world where he stored his games that he had cracked and pirated .
howard is not so easily placated .
ag : so we know that young people are the present and the future , but what inspires me are older people who are becoming transformed in the service of this movement .
now , in a situation where the best current treatment is inexpensive and simple to deliver , the answer is straightforward .
around the world , my shows air in 256 territories in 67 languages for an audience of 30 million people .
but even after months of working feverishly — sleeping in our offices and not going home , candy bars for dinner , coffee by the bucketful — physicists are machines for turning coffee into diagrams — ( laughter ) this little bump would not go away .
so the first time i worked with colors was by making these mosaics of pantone swatches .
when i went to sleep , the next day it wasn &apos;t there .
if you want to add to this picture and try and sketch it globally , you really have to force yourself to go down to the four corners of the earth — africa , india , antarctica , australia — and start putting together some of these pieces .
so john &apos;s now 18 months further down in that journey , and i &apos;ve now asked him to tell us something about his current predicament .
so i &apos;m looking , really , for a mentor , because i just had my birthday .
and it is a true challenge , and i do want you to help me .
there &apos;s a connection between head-tail-heads and head-tail-tails in genetics , and it &apos;s the following .
edison stated it best . he said , &quot; &quot; hell , we ain &apos;t got no rules around here , we &apos;re trying to accomplish something . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so , how do you restore trust ?
because it took negotiation for almost every one of these photographs — to get into that place to make those photographs , and if it wasn &apos;t for those people letting me in at the heads of those corporations , i would have never made this body of work .
why couldn &apos;t masa have taken an airplane to sweden ?
we &apos;d actually — ( laughter ) it would be harder . it would take — take 2 would be a bitch .
i believe we can connect every school in ethiopia , every health clinic , every hospital — we can connect to the internet .
you should be nice to nerds .
getting to school , for a kid that was actually pretty short for his age , through the canadian winter , was not a pleasant experience .
mt : sorry . now , one way of persuading humans that robots are safe is to create the illusion of trust .
the flashlight gives us this really intense , bright l.e.d. , and six hours worth of rechargeable battery pack , and the lunch box is a nice little package in which you can put everything inside , and a bunch of mini speakers to sort of amplify the sound large enough .
this bias and systematic lack of engagement of indigenous people in both clinical trials and genome studies is partially the result of a history of distrust .
so , sometimes , wolfram alpha will be able to do the whole thing immediately and just give back a whole big program that you can then compute with .
i used to be a fan of bach .
they are a kind of social capital .
( laughter ) and so , to me , i wanted more value in this , so when she asked if she could play a game , i said , &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and so i happened to have all of these little pieces .
you see the canal they dug ?
i went to teach seventh graders math in the new york city public schools .
and that is , to me , the sign of a masterpiece , of a painting when there &apos;s a lack of resolution .
so we won &apos;t give the rest of the code , but we will give the three quotations .
and the question is , should we run them or not ?
you can &apos;t be a feminist who &apos;s also interested in fashion .
the future research is &quot; &quot; how can we find the genetic and molecular markers for the viability of seeds , without having to plant them every 10 years ? &quot; &quot; and we &apos;re almost there .
so unfortunately , this orphan spends most of his time in storage , along with quite a number of other orphans , some of them some beautiful paintings .
this was a golden age of bipartisanship , at least in terms of the parties &apos; ability to work together and solve grand national problems .
well , eventually i learned enough english , and my parents were so happy the day that i got into medical school and took my oath of healing and service .
we then use optical sorting to color sort this material .
and i will be in your corner for the rest of your life . &quot; &quot; for me , that is the power of girls .
finally , this is a 26-year-old nun i spoke to .
it &apos;s our own pond . and that &apos;s how it happens . &quot; &quot; and she goes , &quot; &quot; then how do they get fertilized ? &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; well , men , through their penis , they fertilize the eggs by the sperm coming out .
toxic waste , i guess , is the key clue to that one .
it craves stories of success in dealing with complex issues , especially in developing countries .
the ashaninka people are known throughout south america for their dignity , their spirit and their resistance , starting with the incas and continuing through the 19th century with the rubber tappers .
and then there is social media , and what &apos;s happening on the internet .
and it feels just incredibly cool to do that .
but what i &apos;m saying here is that we can make a difference and we can do that by investing .
there are hundreds of them all over the earth , but in this country , james van praagh is very big .
we &apos;ve got to confront that reality .
they accompany me wherever i go in my life , and i fill them with all sorts of things , records of my lived experience : so watercolor paintings , drawings of what i see , dead flowers , dead insects , pasted ticket stubs , rusting coins , business cards , writings .
so i should say , i guess , that since the time of that original president johnson report , and the various reports of the u.s. national academy — 1977 , 1982 , 1990 — people always talked about this idea .
that hit a wall . they couldn &apos;t shrink them and keep the vacuum .
among the most pressing challenges that our species is faced with today are the chronic problems of africa .
the hospital put him on a water drip for three days .
it took me several months to design the column , but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces .
there &apos;s lots of room , so people can come up and understand what it is before they get involved .
so i want to tell you about someone like this that i know .
think of this as a form of edited biology .
we &apos;ll go over to jacques tati here and grab our blue friend and put him down on the table as well .
there she is .
maybe not surprisingly , in the deep ocean , where it &apos;s mostly blue , the photoreceptors tend to see blue light .
whether it &apos;s a &quot; &quot; floral fusion &quot; &quot; or a &quot; &quot; paradise winds , &quot; &quot; they &apos;ll have their chance .
when was the last time you were at ted and you got to connect physically with every single person in the room ?
so anyway , she comes here , 1967 , she &apos;s pregnant , and she comes from ethiopia that was celebrating its own jubilee at the time under the emperor haile selassie , and she lands months before the enoch powell speech , the &quot; &quot; rivers of blood &quot; &quot; speech .
so , everything that i put into my body , i considered as medicine .
it &apos;s such a big problem , so complex . can we really do it ?
so , what if you could get your gas at a 10th the price ?
she also creates life-size fiberglass sculptures , often of animals , which she then completely covers in bindis , often with potent symbolism .
and you can &apos;t just draw them arbitrarily .
first we &apos;ll see the animals toes peeling — look at that .
and if you don &apos;t know where to find someone different , go to the places you wouldn &apos;t usually go .
and what looks like two big heaps of leaves , is actually two single leaves that get shredded up by the harsh desert conditions over time .
and we &apos;re acting out of that fear .
if you are trying to solve a really hard problem , you can speak up and be color brave .
this is hitting the reservoirs .
on twitter that night , we were like toddlers crawling towards a gun .
well real organized crime on the internet goes back about 10 years when a group of gifted ukrainian hackers developed a website , which led to the industrialization of cybercrime .
and after noah built his ark , i believe he told noah to warn the people that they must change all their wicked ways before he come upon them and destroy them .
because here &apos;s the crazy thing : in law enforcement , we have evolved into something incredible .
these were networks of mercenaries , not ideologues , who were in the coordination business for profit .
and when you &apos;re hungry , food becomes more attractive , and so forth .
it &apos;s their right to fight . &quot; &quot; now as you know , mandela didn &apos;t do that .
going back to the beginning of our country — historically , defenses meant protection of the homeland .
i collect autographed books , and those of you authors in the audience know i hound you for them — and cds too , tracy .
so we had jonathan train with the vest for four days , two hours a day , and here he is on the fifth day .
they can be shocking or silly or soulful .
this is the mechanism by which you lower blood pressure , by which you dilate the coronary arteries also , to let the blood be supplied with the heart .
i sit on the board of a center for the developmentally disabled , and these people want laughter and compassion and they want love .
now to bring home the point of how close it is — the relationship between the grid of neurons and the topographical arrangement of the activity of the neurons and our mental experience — i &apos;m going to tell you a personal story .
does your work relate to his ?
we &apos;ve actually kind of made an ethical choice in society to not have coral reefs .
so here are some of the technical terms , all three-letter things , that you &apos;ll see a lot more of .
and even animals , like these donkeys , love our buildings .
so where are we ?
this work , which was published in &quot; &quot; nature , &quot; &quot; late 2009 , after a number of years of analysis , led to the final proposition that we can only find nine planetary boundaries with which , under active stewardship , would allow ourselves to have a safe operating space .
ak : wow , a hundred million miles away . this is crazy !
we just dismiss it out of our consciousness .
here &apos;s the first easy problem : you can have 60 dollars now or 50 dollars now . which would you prefer ?
so imagine , if you as a high school can have the satellite for a week and do satellite space experiments like that .
those were the achievements of our great regime .
you see , we tend to think the problem is solved when we solve the technology problem .
so why is that happening ?
so listening to this brought something to the ear besides the obvious burst .
one is in india , where there are 240 million farmers , most of whom make less than two dollars a day .
and this routine went on for some time .
in order not to steal it from our children , we have to do two things .
and they just wiped out — these pathogens just wiped out the native people , who had no immunity to them at all .
i have here a model of the sky that corresponds to the real sky . okay ?
they dropped it , they walked away , but they were arrested .
and the reason why i bring up radio is that i think radio is a great example of how a new medium defines new formats which then define new stories .
and if i can get the camera — okay , great — you &apos;ll see , as i get sort of close ...
in fact , i view the two forces as fusing together into what i call &quot; &quot; connectography . &quot; &quot; connectography represents a quantum leap in the mobility of people , resources and ideas , but it is an evolution , an evolution of the world from political geography , which is how we legally divide the world , to functional geography , which is how we actually use the world , from nations and borders , to infrastructure and supply chains .
another flash alerts you to an open receiver .
and if you &apos;re a leader , the people who count on you need you on your feet .
can you say &quot; &quot; raw &quot; &quot; ?
so , it has to end with this — ( laughter ) — gratuitous violence . ( laughter )
well , how do we boot up a chromosome ? how do we activate this ?
and so the first thought that came to mind is , everywhere we park we have electric power .
tell us briefly about that and your role in that .
it is very scary to go through that feeling of &quot; &quot; i am about to die &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; i could die in this explosion . &quot; &quot; but there &apos;s also the fear of losing loved ones , and i think that &apos;s even worse .
and this turns out to be useful .
second of all , the court doubled down on this exclusion by making it legally inconsequential .
let &apos;s talk about billions . let &apos;s talk about
being criminalized leaves you exposed to mistreatment by the state itself .
and you know , it &apos;s just one of the great things about being a musician , is that it is so unbelievably fluid .
it means &quot; &quot; i have enough . &quot; &quot; and that is utterly true .
the concept that they &apos;re working towards — and they have working prototypes — is that we placed it throughout the motor points of the body where they &apos;re needed .
so my freshman year of college i signed up for an internship in the housing unit at greater boston legal services .
it &apos;s not a lot of money at the global level .
tolerance is not really a lived virtue ; it &apos;s more of a cerebral ascent .
and as far as isolation goes , when we as a species do colonize distant planets , there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way .
( laughter ) sr : are you convinced ?
what if , in the coming crowd of nine billion ...
two men , rahul and rajiv , living in the same neighborhood , from the same educational background , similar occupation , and they both turn up at their local accident emergency complaining of acute chest pain .
so when the echo of the gunshots had lingered , it was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob , and i didn &apos;t believe what i was hearing .
now , here &apos;s the story .
the colors show the continent .
so in fact , the price of timber in the beijing marketplace ought to have been three-times what it was had it reflected the true pain and the costs to the society within china .
and yet you don &apos;t put a letter after that first &quot; &quot; t. &quot; &quot; why ? because it wouldn &apos;t have been useful in the past .
so one of the people that i met was a senior bush administration official , who had this to say about our unmanning of war : &quot; &quot; it plays to our strength . the thing that scares people is our technology . &quot; &quot; but when you go out and meet with people , for example in lebanon , it &apos;s a very different story . one of the people i met with there was a news editor , and we &apos;re talking as a drone is flying above him , and this is what he had to say .
it &apos;s brought a lot of bad stuff , like the stuff that i just described , but it &apos;s also brought a lot of good stuff .
right now , her favorite character is groot .
well , what happened when i was a little kid was — some pretty heavy stuff too .
this light switch that reads , on the one hand , flashfloods , and on the other hand , off .
this plus the fact that you &apos;ve got phenomenal work from ceos from ford to zappos , connecting on twitter , creating an open environment , allowing their employees to be part of the process , rather than hidden behind walls .
and the blue hoods helped us with two things : one , we could easily erase their heads ; and we also put tracking markers on their heads so we could recreate the camera motion and the lens optics from the set .
thank you for your kind attention .
it &apos;s really a time machine .
here &apos;s the gecko running up a vertical surface . there it goes , in real time . there it goes again . obviously , we have to slow this down a little bit .
so of course , labor isn &apos;t free , on that practical versus awesome spectrum .
and that &apos;s that the company and the building was multiform .
the other kind of reviewer is a certain flavor of feminist who thinks they know what little girls ought to be .

you can make a biocensor out of yeast to detect pollutants in water .
alpha is the distribution of the sizes of attacks , which is really the distribution of the group strength carrying out the attacks .
and quite often we sit in a design meeting and we discover that there is this great idea .
and it is an awesome thing to be a part of empowering someone in this way .
and when you &apos;ve got that , you &apos;ve pretty much sacrificed any hope of making lots of money .
so you can look at that piece , but you can look at the other pieces too .
when we first put the mouse into this box , it &apos;s exploring , sniffing around , walking around , minding its own business , because actually by nature , mice are pretty curious animals .
now , all of the women , or most of the women in vermeer &apos;s other paintings wore velvet , silk , fur , very sumptuous materials .
but i think that it &apos;s quite interesting to know that there is really mathematical evidence to say that you should never let the sun go down on your anger .
there is jeopardy , and of course , the closer you get , it gets harder .
but they have other communication signals they use .
and here is the fruition of that in actuality .
and michael fleischman was another ph.d. student in my lab who worked with me on this home video analysis , and he made the following observation : that &quot; &quot; just the way that we &apos;re analyzing how language connects to events which provide common ground for language , that same idea we can take out of your home , deb , and we can apply it to the world of public media . &quot; &quot; and so our effort took an unexpected turn .
for the most basic , most common , most frustrating part of being a patient .
it ’ s a neural system that ’ s wired up to reward the brain for doing a grubby clerical job .
if you remember that bald guy , you &apos;ll know that what has been stripped off of these trunks in the pacific northwest old-growth forest is going to take decades and decades to come back .
it &apos;s happening to me , i know that &apos;s right .
once upon a time there &apos;s this happy little bacterium .
and then we stuck them under the steps .
i still had migraine headaches .
government institutions were completely decapitated , including the presidential palace .
( laughter ) it &apos;s really cool .
and i thought up a lot of ideas .
and my daughter — oh , surely she is extra-intelligent . &quot; &quot; and so on . so i suddenly figured that , how come all the rich people are having these extraordinarily gifted children ?
and i think it &apos;s because of what i &apos;m hearing today in ted talks .
it is to explain death to a child , and it deserves a piece of plain-song music . &quot; &quot; and my blood froze when i read that because i had written the plain-song music 130 years after he &apos;d written the letter .
if you do this , you surely will hit somewhere near the center .
and then when i got home , i sat down and i set myself to task to really try to create something just completely outside of the box .
and we lobbied on behalf of women &apos;s issues .
at dec , i worked on software for the new area of computerized typesetting .
and we &apos;ve seen that repeatedly through this conference , not just this year , but in past years .
so at the age of 14 my father had to work .
and the one thing i &apos;d like to point out here is that we &apos;ve done this before .
if they could do it for them , surely they could do it for me .
several scientific studies have shown that abnormal microrna expression levels varies and creates a unique , specific pattern for each type of cancer , even at the early stages , reflecting the progression of the disease , and whether it &apos;s responding to medication or in remission , making micrornas a perfect , highly sensitive biomarker .
( applause ) i want to talk to you a little bit about user-generated content .
she had a spina bifida defect , a spinal cord abnormality .
and what kind of things were people talking about ?
eventually , though , paul thinks that she just figured that he was never going to survive .
you press start , nobody touches anything , and it can reach its destination fully autonomously .
( laughter ) i did that for two reasons .
our relationship is still important .
i &apos;m palestinian , muslim , i &apos;m female , i &apos;m disabled , and i live in new jersey .
in germany , scientists are starting to find evidence of autoimmunity , and in japan , of brain inflammation .
china &apos;s highest ruling body , the politburo , has 25 members .
but the most important thing we must do is , i think , we must all walk to the end of our lives and turn around , and ask ourselves a most fundamental question .
these ideas probably remind you of &quot; &quot; total recall , &quot; &quot; &quot; eternal sunshine of the spotless mind , &quot; or of &quot; &quot; inception . &quot; &quot; but the movie stars that we work with are the celebrities of the lab .
but it was interesting because i had some very preconceived notions about , for instance , evangelical christianity , and i found that it &apos;s such a wide and varied movement that it is difficult to make generalizations about it .
from astronauts &apos; experiences in space , we know that spending time in a microgravity environment means bone loss , muscle atrophy , cardiovascular problems , among many other complications that range for the physiological to the psychological .
so in other words , while our vascular system uses the three dimensions inside us , our urban transportation is mostly two-dimensional .
so i &apos;m on a mission to change that .
the first day they all came back .
but he doesn &apos;t know whether it &apos;s an infection , whether it &apos;s to do with malnutrition .
it &apos;s got an amazing user experience .
so inside our country , we are a net carbon sink .
this is my first trip , first time in life i &apos;m outside of the walls of gaza .
the monarch butterfly could be one of the 20 to 50 percent of all species that the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates will be ticketed for extinction by the end of the century if we stay on business-as-usual fossil fuel use .
but in the mean time , i &apos;m going to call on the worldwide education expert , who &apos;s my 10-year-old daughter , noa , to talk to you about why the boys in her class do worse .
which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice overload problem , which is concretization .
does it have to take a tragedy or a disaster for us to feel deeply connected as one species , as human beings ?
you were sleeping during that class .
who decides what reality is ?
and when the resources came , be it oil , we started building these fancy technologies and bringing people together because we needed the concentration .
then i ran 50 miles — ultramarathons .
another called maidsafe works on similar principles .
and she does really good business . in fact , i watched her walk through the streets hawking . and before you knew it , there was a crowd of women around her , buying these dresses .
on the top , now , that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through — the dotted line , the temperatures .
someone put up all the wikileaked cables from the state department , along with software used to interpret them , including my favorite use ever of the cablegate cables , which is a tool for detecting naturally occurring haiku in state department prose .
we &apos;re ready because we &apos;ve seen , in the financial crisis of 2008 , how our fetish for economic growth led us so far astray .
so you start with the personalized data where the speed limit on the road that you are at that point is 25 , and , of course , you &apos;re going faster than that .
ten years ago , on a tuesday morning , i conducted a parachute jump at fort bragg , north carolina .
well it means growing an actual heart , let &apos;s say , or grow a piece of bone that can be put into the body .
it &apos;s kind of like genomics .
they can detect credit card fraud and block spam and they can translate between languages .
the dot is visible whenever a cell fires an electrical impulse .
well , let me give you a demonstration of about 200 instruments we &apos;ve created so far for the laptop orchestra .
but i &apos;ve done more in the seven decades since that miserable day when my mother put me on the train than i would ever have dreamed possible .
i was a young australian woman doing extraordinary things in london .
and i realized that , when i &apos;d left the country , free and fair elections in a democratic environment were a dream .
so the best place for x-ray crystallography was at the cavendish laboratory at cambridge .
we might not ever know .
oh , look how it lies there .
mm : the medium does things to people and they are always completely unaware of this .
shit offends people . feces is too medical .
so , how do they do that ?
what they &apos;ve done is they &apos;ve shifted their operations .
thank you .
interestingly enough , an example : one young man who earned a c in the first course and wanted to go on to med school , we said , &quot; &quot; we need to have you retake the course , because you need a strong foundation if you &apos;re going to move to the next level . &quot; &quot; every foundation makes the difference in the next level .
but then one night , my mom was cooking grilled chicken for dinner , and i noticed that the edges of the chicken , which had been marinated in lemon juice , turned white .
we &apos;ve observed that the process of art therapy bypasses the speech-language issue with the brain .
hp : thank you . ( applause )
and the then-communications minister replied in a lordly manner that in a developing country communications are a luxury , not a right , that the government had no obligation to provide better service , and if the honorable member wasn &apos;t satisfied with his telephone , could he please return it , since there was an eight-year-long waiting list for telephones in india .
there was a great story of some little girl who they saved from leukemia by taking the blood out , editing it , and putting it back with a precursor of crispr .
i was one of the only kids in college who had a reason to go to the p.o. box at the end of the day , and that was mainly because my mother has never believed in email , in facebook , in texting or cell phones in general .
banking hasn &apos;t always been the way we read about it now in the newspapers .
or the man who decides that he is going to take his life , uses facebook as a way to say goodbye to friends and family .
now , let me ask you another question .
&quot; limpia &quot; means &quot; clean , &quot; because we want to empower and we want to inspire citizens .
language must have been useful for the genes .
and our work doesn &apos;t really resolve itself into a body in any way at all .
now smule &apos;s mission is to create expressive , mobile music things , and one of the first musical instruments we created is called ocarina .
it &apos;s a mystery .
children don &apos;t like it .
and then leilei — i know his other name — told us about interconnection , and how we &apos;re all totally interconnected here , and how we &apos;ve all known each other . and of course in the buddhist universe , we &apos;ve already done this already billions of times in many , many lifetimes in the past .
but the effect is relatively small .
so that &apos;s why the petitioner , the victims , the peasants , want to take the train to beijing to petition to the central government , they want the emperor to settle the problem .
they will enable compelling new concepts in how we design cities , work , and the way we live .
when play is about building a tower out of blocks , the kid begins to learn a lot about towers .
( laughter ) now how would you feel about handing your phone over ?
and what &apos;s happening here , this is where you &apos;ve actually elected to join that nike community . you &apos;ve bought into it .
person with the goods , person with the money , because they can &apos;t trust each other , are not going to exchange .
find the truth for yourself , and when you find the truth for yourself , there will be a truth in it , but it may contradict the plot , but don &apos;t worry about it . &quot; &quot; so , the sequel to &quot; &quot; elizabeth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; golden age . &quot; &quot; when i made the sequel to &quot; &quot; elizabeth , &quot; &quot; here was a story that the writer was telling : a woman who was threatened by philip ii and was going to war , and was going to war , fell in love with walter raleigh .
it takes really a lot of time and it &apos;s expensive to train the operator to operate this complex arm .
add on pandemic threat , you &apos;re in big trouble .
and i didn &apos;t know exactly why i had it , but it was so vivid .
and i thought , well , henry viii , okay .
and she &apos;s already at the nano .
did you touch it ?
boltzmann explained that if you start with low entropy , it &apos;s very natural for it to increase because there &apos;s more ways to be high entropy .
be a mentor .
es : i can see you . ( laughter ) ca : and who goes with the second choice , the fundamentally heroic act ?
when i enter into dialogue , i really hope that the other side would pick up my points of view , that i would impress upon them my opinions and my values .
so you imagine , if we &apos;re able to create a self-sustaining artificial life form , not only will this tell us about the origin of life — that it &apos;s possible that the universe doesn &apos;t need carbon to be alive ; it can use anything — we can then take &#91; it &#93; one step further and develop new technologies , because we can then use software control for evolution to code in .
now if i graph , for instance , some other technology , say transportation technology , on a semi-log curve , it would look very stupid , it would look like a flat line .
you can make objective claims about a domain that is subjective in its mode of existence , and indeed that &apos;s what neurologists do .
so nowadays in the operating room , we no longer need to use sunlight .
when you actually look at the motor of the world economy , it cannot move forward unless there is trade between the different countries .
remember that image from the beginning ?
ca : and then the only recourse is some form of forced migration .
using a grid the size of your thumb , with 32 electrodes on the surface of his brain , tim uses his thoughts to control an advanced prosthetic arm .
i remember thinking , my friend could have explained that entire experiment with a dance .
that means that by the age of five , you can &apos;t see as well for the rest of your life .
children are not adults .
light comes through , it bounces back off the layers ; it &apos;s called thin-film interference . imagine being able to self-assemble products with the last few layers playing with light to create color .
only months later , i discover who he really was .
there &apos;s other ways of making flaps .
richard dawkins : &quot; &quot; we &apos;ve evolved around courtship and sex , are attached to deep-rooted emotions and reactions that are hard to jettison overnight . &quot; &quot; david pizarro : so my favorite part of this clip is that professor dawkins actually gagged .
after a while , i got a bit — i wanted to go somewhere else .
i am going to tell you how i do it and the most important thing i &apos;ve learned .
i have no idea how that works . we &apos;ll send that over there .
with those three systems , you have what is always necessary — a level of redundancy that says , if one system fails , you &apos;ll still have a way to make sure that you &apos;re being controlled .
and the very best of luck to you .
and as the sandstone weathers , new grains break free .
but he experiences himself , his thoughts and feelings , as something separate from the rest ...
but some of you might not know that the arm itself can actually regenerate a complete starfish .
we got a survey done on medical conditions with people who have similar issues , and i look at medical records , and i say , wouldn &apos;t it be amazing if everyone &apos;s medical records were available anonymously to research doctors ?
the year is 2005 .
somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles .
the world that meant a lot to me , i saw it vanish in my face .
kallikuppam had caught up with my control school in new delhi , a rich private school with a trained biotechnology teacher .
he was a very selfish meme .
on average , there &apos;s one within 20 to 30 miles of wherever you are in the united states .
the employment in the rich countries will go down from about 800 to about 700 million of these people .
but in order to try and explain the whole thing , i would need another 18 minutes or so to do it , so you &apos;re just going to have to take it on trust from me on this occasion , and let me assure you that all of these issues are involved in cybersecurity and control of the internet one way or the other , but in a configuration that even stephen hawking would probably have difficulty trying to get his head around .
now if we look forward a bit to the 19th century , we find a new style of technology .
( laughter ) voice : look at my smile .
she still made the two-hour trek to the schoolhouse and tried to catch every little bit of information that seeped out of the doors .
pope francis , who has made such a difference to this whole issue , visited tacloban right after that .
so we better find out what the target is soon . &quot; &quot; so we extracted and decompiled the attack code , and we discovered that it &apos;s structured in two digital bombs — a smaller one and a bigger one .
people &apos;s states of their own body changed how they perceived the environment .
that &apos;s what happens to me . it kind of ruins my whole week , because whatever i &apos;ve got planned that week is kind of out the window .
there was just no future .
and many advances now , we can do that fairly readily .
there &apos;s 7.3 billion people in the world today ; there will be 9.6 billion by 2050 .
and humans dispersed — not once , but twice .
i don &apos;t think so .
the government recently announced plans to return to the moon by 2024 .
and so immediately as you meet people , you shake their hand , and then your eyes go to their shoulder , because you want to see where did they serve , or what unit did they serve with ?
i met humble people .
now , i get to the final thing , which is the set of which my name is attached .
the second stage was completed at the penn state university main campus lab , which is where i extracted the chemicals , changed the ph so i could run it through the equipment and separated the compounds i needed from the rest of the chicken .
and then when rockefeller center said , nbc , could you put this thing up on the walls ? we were delighted .
but the most surprising part was when we turned to , what are we going to work on in the week ahead ?
so what we did was put all the instructions online as open source .
health studies from the region are conflicting and fraught .
therefore , they asked their parents to go down to the streets and collect them , bring them back home .
and , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time .
( laughter ) this was a fun one .
those are their expectations of who you are , not yours .
( laughter ) don &apos;t go asking for a frappuccino there .
it doesn &apos;t , i agree , look very much .
i &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; wow , that was great — ( laughter ) — please lady , don &apos;t say another word . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and the camera is down at her , and this guy has to put the microphone in her face , said , &quot; &quot; what do you mean by that ? &quot; &quot; and i figured , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all over now , &quot; &quot; and she looks up and she says , &quot; &quot; well , &quot; &quot; she &apos;s still watching these guys go ; she says , &quot; &quot; i can &apos;t ride a bike , &quot; &quot; no , she says , &quot; &quot; i can &apos;t use a skateboard , and i &apos;ve never used roller blades , &quot; &quot; she knew them by name ; she says , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s been 50 years since i rode a bicycle . &quot; &quot; then she looks up , she &apos;s looking up , and she says ,
when we originally looked at bringing civil actions against terrorists , everyone thought we were a bit mad and mavericks and crackpots . now it &apos;s got a title . everyone &apos;s doing it .
i make the dove appear .
there &apos;s a bit of randomness here too because , when i was beginning independent diplomat , i went to a party in the house of lords , which is a ridiculous place , but i was holding my drink like this , and i bumped into this guy who was standing behind me .
and so many opportunities get missed when that happens .
( laughter ) which tells you something about our place in the universe .
why strangeness ? because our social relations are increasingly mediated by data , and data turns our social relations into digital relations , and that means that our digital relations now depend extraordinarily on technology to bring to them a sense of robustness , a sense of discovery , a sense of surprise and unpredictability .
most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day .
and i &apos;m grateful .
here &apos;s the idea .
what about global politics ?
the only thing that they don &apos;t have is access to resources . they don &apos;t even have a textbook sometimes , and they don &apos;t even have a proper curriculum .
so , there &apos;s going to be a tremendous struggle .
sughar is a local word used in many , many languages in pakistan .
and by seven minutes and 30 seconds , they had to pull my body out and bring me back .
the same is true every time as i started thinking about information .
vertically , you have the time .
i taped my aunt . i taped my aunt singing a song in russian from the — you know , could we have it for a second ?
the shipping lanes have been moved .
ag : that &apos;s right .
you &apos;re literally in your own world .
so there &apos;s some problem with these metrics now .
so this is what we hope to do in the next few years .
and some people will get people to be on the other team .
she &apos;s carrying all the weight through harnesses .
i can &apos;t wait to find out what it looks like .
&quot; &quot; pickpocket &quot; &quot; started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement .
so the smell of vanilla , that might change the four on the left to brown and the one on the right to yellow . this matrix can produce thousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells .
i have a wonderful visit to facebook hq coming up .
( applause ) so let me tell you a little bit how this was done .
because when we looked at the four platforms around the site , one of which is an upgrade of the families &apos; platform , we knew that these had to be moveable to respond to changing conditions , and the changing definition of what ground zero is .
and that &apos;s the difference between problems that are additive , like co2 , which we go slowly up and then we tip , and problems that are depletive , in which we lose what we have , which oscillate , and they oscillate until we lose everything we &apos;ve got .
but i think that glamour actually has a much broader meaning — one that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters , but also comes in other forms .
for myself , i tried to get away from infectious diseases , and i didn &apos;t .
let &apos;s start here .
and that led to all kinds of things , from being in curricula in universities and schools to — one of my favorite pictures i have from south asia , it was a couple of men with long beards and a lot of girls wearing the hijab — it looked like a school .
there was shared attention looking at the same sort of thing , and recognizing socially communicated reinforcement at the end .
and all of the data , we aligned based on the following idea : every time my son would learn a word , we would trace back and look at all of the language he heard that contained that word .
here &apos;s a question that matters .
one way of thinking about it is to imagine what it would be like if language — where it could only be used literally .
and so does every wild habitat on the planet , like the amazon rainforest you &apos;re hearing behind me .
what we can measure is that tangible stuff at the bottom of the pyramid .
and , so now , when the polar ice caps melt , my recording studio will rise up like an ark , and i &apos;ll float off into the drowned world like a character from a j.g. ballard novel .
the more stress , the less brain development , which in turn causes less adaptability and causes higher stress levels .
why do many people believe that india is still a growth disaster ?
then we can actually see that what started out as just straight lines is actually a curve called a parabola .
we have to have treatment centers , specialized ebola treatment centers , where the workers can be protected as they try to provide support to the people who are infected , so that they might survive the disease .
at the present time , my collaborators and i , what we &apos;re aiming for is much more modest — just to find partial connectomes of tiny chunks of mouse and human brain .
probably the largest urban-renewal project , i think , ever attempted on the planet .
this was taken in the riviera sugar factory in red hook , brooklyn .
and that i do .
the words &quot; &quot; water &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; dry &quot; &quot; do not match , right ?
and then he got so excited , he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better , and the giant didn &apos;t run away , so he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible , bringing a creature of legend from the misty history into high-resolution video .
his father was an sob , and , in fact , he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood , but then we were off and running .
you know , she was very chic , but she was very filled with ennui , you know .
and every now and then , find a friend , find a turtle , and take a long , slow walk .
they comment on politics , they cry out against the evils of congress .
so this was how the finished shot appeared in the film .
because by definition , news is something that almost never happens .
well , as a synonym , they often use ambiences .
all of origami comes from that .
and how fast do you think we are moving ?
so anybody who &apos;s ever looked at ants has seen them touch antennae .
and so we need to ensure that these people who are living with hiv or at greatest risk of hiv have access to legal services and they have equal access to the courts .
here we have &quot; &quot; figure &quot; &quot; in white .
and i was a guinea pig , as i hope to continue to be in every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out .
and then i — this sort of thing is ideal for tidying up .
and the fourth thing is that you actually did one or the other of those three things , but the paleontologist never found you .
and , you know , as a parent , especially for the first time , why is he not going to be better than us ?
and with these cheetos , i began to think , &quot; what can i make with these cheetos ? &quot;
and do we really want to live in a society where people are denied their basic humanity if they don &apos;t subscribe to some arbitrary form of acceptable ?
ethiopia didn &apos;t just blow my mind ; it opened my mind .
the opposite happened .
if you go back in time about &#91; 75,000 &#93; to 100,000 years ago , let &apos;s look at human evolution , it turns out that something very important happened around 75,000 years ago .
but i &apos;m also happy and honored to be up here and i think that it &apos;s great that i got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and i &apos;d had more agency in my career , because maybe then i wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how i got my first job , or maybe i wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how i paid for college , which seems so important right now .
you &apos;re saying hey , you know , i don &apos;t think i &apos;m going to need them , so i &apos;m just going to trust that , you know , let &apos;s get rid of them , it doesn &apos;t really matter , these guys are going to do the right thing .
and surely , if you &apos;re reading a poem that mentions a cow , you don &apos;t need on the facing page a drawing of a cow .
and so i &apos;m so excited to discuss this with them , and i come in and i say , &quot; &quot; can somebody please explain the main ideas and why this is so cool ? &quot; &quot; there &apos;s silence .
well , i think what part of the problem is that , in haiti , although the problem is huge , somehow we understand it , it &apos;s localized .
proximate self-similarity . and that accounts for this phenomenon .
it &apos;s a different way of thinking about it , but i think it &apos;s kind of beautiful , because it is certainly far more inclusive than the us-versus-them or the abled-versus-the-disabled , and it &apos;s a lot more honest and respectful of the fragility of life .
you open your eyes and there &apos;s the world .
he pointed out the river and the train tracks where the largest domestic slave-trading port in america had once prospered .
it &apos;s quite a bit more than any other organization in the world has , as far as we know .
and they share a lengthy land border .
and they do this wrapping .
the gloves go away in a matter of months or years .
but coke noticed something — they noticed that local people were taking the product , buying it in bulk and then reselling it in these hard-to-reach places .
would you get in an airplane with 250 people you didn &apos;t know , coughing and sneezing , when you knew that some of them might carry a disease that could kill you , for which you had no antivirals or vaccine ?
and where in the world would you find such water ?
so the sub that was outside last year — this is the one .
so they came up with a tumbling service .
but there &apos;s a huge market out there , and people don &apos;t know about it , or they don &apos;t want to know .
that &apos;s larger than the entire population of russia .
yb : thank you .
we &apos;ve actually tagged 1,100 tunas .
monica has taken thousands of portraits with a group of photographers and covered the entire border .
but the rest of us — this is a room filled with people who are passionate about the future of this planet , and even we aren &apos;t paying attention to the energy use that &apos;s driving climate change .
i graduated high school in may , and — ( laughter ) ( applause ) — i graduated high school in may , and i decided that i was going to start up a company to commercialize these technologies that i &apos;ve developed , these revolutionary detectors for scanning cargo containers and these systems to produce medical isotopes , but i want to do this , and i &apos;ve slowly been building up a team of some of the most incredible people i &apos;ve ever had the chance to work with , and i &apos;m really prepared to make this a reality .
this uses 20 times less energy for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car , which means not only is this thing fast to charge and really cheap to build , but it also reduces the footprint of your energy use in terms of your transportation .
there &apos;s a good person .
and it &apos;s going to take real work to change that .
( laughter ) ( applause ) ( applause ends ) this quad has a racket strapped onto its head with a sweet spot roughly the size of an apple , so not too large .
there &apos;s actually going to be a meeting a month from tomorrow in washington , d.c.
they want to focus on long-term economic stability and growth .
the manager pointed at the computer in the room .
i have a son .
thank you .
social media only amplified that state , by facilitating the spread of misinformation , rumors , echo chambers and hate speech .
he had this little voice telling him that maybe his time was weeks to months .
it &apos;s called odonil .
you have to realize that you can &apos;t fight and control this .
the average car costs 8,000 dollars a year to run .
so , we are not being charged with the adequate response to what is happening .

five years ago my mother and i went back to chau doc .
the printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge .
it &apos;s based on the central principle of improvisation theater , so here improvisation theater came to my help again .
pew research did a study of 10,000 american adults , and they found that at this moment , we are more polarized , we are more divided , than we ever have been in history .
that code looks pretty much like all the other code on that system .
but i didn &apos;t get it .
i became obsessed with the object — not just the beautiful photograph itself , and the color , the shallow depth of field , the detail that &apos;s visible , the wire you can see on the beak there that the conservator used to put this skeleton together — there &apos;s an entire story here .
the law requires accountability .

it means you need to offer four things simultaneously : there needs to be a proper reason to walk , the walk has to be safe and feel safe , the walk has to be comfortable and the walk has to be interesting .
how much is your field talking to great marketers about their insights into human psychology ?
so , it &apos;s a full range of facial expressions simulating all the major muscles in the human face , running on very small batteries , extremely lightweight .
like i &apos;ll read that one of the two attributes of matter in the newtonian universe — there are two attributes of matter in the newtonian universe — one is space occupancy . matter takes up space .
i &apos;m talking here a little bit about display technologies .
most of them explode spontaneously in contact with air , and when you call up the companies , they only give you minimum ten tons , ok ?

if i go out in the open ocean environment , virtually anywhere in the world , and i drag a net from 3,000 feet to the surface , most of the animals — in fact , in many places , 80 to 90 percent of the animals that i bring up in that net — make light .
they &apos;re both of our making — this is man interacting with the environment and doing some rather unpleasant things .

we &apos;re not doing as well at that job as we should be .
and one night , it began to snow outside .
what i decided to look for was a strong data and analytic risk assessment tool , something that would let judges actually understand with a scientific and objective way what the risk was that was posed by someone in front of them .
our higher resolution images show deltas and river valleys and gulleys that were there in the past .
( applause ) it &apos;s nothing we had to do about this .
this is the muktuk , or the blubber , all lined up for community distribution .
and i &apos;ll show you , if you take this approach , what you get , ok ?
please , please , just get out of denial and go looking for disconfirming data that will prove that in fact your old stereotypes are wrong .
let me try and tell you — i don ’ t mean to insult you , but look , if i — and i ’ m not doing this for real because it would be an insult , so i ’ m going to pretend , and it softens the blow — i ’ m going to tell you what you ’ re thinking .

i was not the militant lesbian ready to fight any four-year-old that walked into the cafe .

it actually uses the light from the bacteria to counter-illuminate itself in an anti-predation device so predators can &apos;t see its shadow , calculate its trajectory , and eat it .
and another man looked in my direction and said , &quot; yes , there he is . he &apos;s on this elevator with us . &quot;
now , the commodity exchange itself , that concept , is not new to the world .
he said , &quot; &quot; if i keep tossing myself off i get fresh sperm being made . &quot; &quot; which i thought was an interesting idea , theory .
so out of all these planets out there , and the variety is just simply astonishing , we mostly want to find the planets that are goldilocks planets , we call them .
and i would like you to join with all of humanity to draw a line in the sand and say , &quot; &quot; no more .
and i might add , by the way , over half of us are women .
on the contrary , it produces pleasure .
when she went to her in-laws &apos; house , they forced her into prostitution .
now , there &apos;s the shifting baseline problem , which is , so when these things come back , they might replace some birds that are there that people really know and love .
jh : so you &apos;re not a gatekeeper for these forces .
that is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the remembering self .
with my classes , i sometimes give them a basic fact that might be revealing with respect to their personality : i tell them that it is virtually impossible for adults to lick the outside of their own elbow .
so we would remove the algaes that concentrated in the bottom of this column , and then we could harvest that by a procedure where you float the algae to the surface and can skim it off with a net .
the third , is this too much information ?
i sometimes think i &apos;d rather give up meat or sex or wine than the chance to check on my emails .
but they failed , almost completely , to make any .
now these traffic figures are really exciting and a little bit surprising and very useful to know , but i would say that the most surprising slide here i &apos;m going to show you today is not this one . it &apos;s this one .
i &apos;ve lived in france for about four , and i feel actually thrown back 20 years , living in france .
she knew it was a hallucination .
we want them to deliver prosperity , growth , competitiveness , transparency , justice and all of those things .
in gando , there was no electricity , no access to clean drinking water , and no school .
so the myth here is that the left brain is logical , it &apos;s good with equations like this , and the right brain is more creative , so the right brain is better at music .
it blows my mind away that we can now quantify something as personal as our emotions , and we can do it at this scale .
now this is not something that &apos;s ready for the public , but it is in working progress .
our cultural imagination about compassion has been deadened by idealistic images .
and for this reason , they were deeply disturbed , deeply alarmed and the entire epidemic was unraveling in front of them .

what would you choose to invent next ?
has anyone among you ever been exposed to tear gas ?
things like , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s so real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely believable , &quot; &quot; or , of course , the one that i was excited about , &quot; &quot; a real feeling as if you were in the middle of something that you normally see on the tv news . &quot; &quot; so , it works , right ? this stuff works .
and i know because when you look at the rainfall , these particular insects , these globe skimmers breed in temporary rain water pools .

all the while , the skeleton lay everlasting and unchanging in perfect equilibrium within its rocky grave .
we can abstract them and to create something that is new .
i grew up poor in north philadelphia too .
and we could hardly even pay anything , any salaries , in the economy .
( audio ) ♫ right now , it feels like i forgot to turn the light on ♫ ♫ and things that looked so good yesterday ♫ ♫ are now shades of gray ♫ ♫ and it seems like the world is spinning ♫ ♫ while i &apos;m standing still ♫ ♫ or maybe i am spinning i can &apos;t tell ♫ ♫ and then you say ♫ ♫ hey ♫ ♫ you &apos;re okay ♫ ♫ you &apos;ll be fine ♫ ♫ just breathe ♫ ♫ and now the words sing ♫ ♫ hey ♫ ♫ you &apos;re okay ♫ ♫ you &apos;ll be fine ♫ ♫ just breathe ♫

we brought musicians to the canopy , and they made their music — and it &apos;s fantastic music .
( applause ) ls : let me show you the experimental results .
i didn &apos;t have to try to flap my wings .
we have thousands and thousands of european fighters in syria and in iraq , so this is not something that you solve by just not allowing syrians to come in .
just as we can &apos;t predict what one molecule in a gas will do — it &apos;s hopeless to predict a single molecule — yet we can predict the properties of the whole gas , using thermodynamics , very accurately .
lp : well , i think for me , this is kind of one of the most exciting things i &apos;ve seen in a long time .
sign my petition on change.org and type in khadija , my name , and it &apos;ll come up , and sign it .
you can see a different column in the mirror , if there &apos;s a mirror behind the column that creates a sort of an optical illusion .

not just translate them , but interpret them .
( sa : customizable for the boss of your choice . ) dk : and of course : a hammock for your afternoon nap that stretches across your cubicle .
it &apos;s called momentum .
and now string theory comes along and says , yes , gravity , quantum mechanics , electromagnetism , all together in one package , but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see .
so it was not easy at all .
so i &apos;m going to show you a few examples of what we can do .
( laughter ) so let me tell you what aroused such irate responses , and i &apos;ll let you decide if whether they — the claims are really that outrageous .
now i don &apos;t mean extra gills or something — something we care about , like aging .
they did not get me any closer to understanding why i thought i recognized this one particular poem .
consider the memory of long temporal sequences of movements , like a pianist playing a beethoven sonata .
we homo sapiens are the only species we know of that is driven to scientific inquiry .
yet king david sought god &apos;s forgiveness , and said , &quot; &quot; you can restore my soul . &quot; &quot; you see , the bible teaches that we &apos;re more than a body and a mind .

this architecture of mixity can still be read in the remains .
for the first time in the united states , a predominantly white group of voters voted for an african-american candidate for president .
now , they call me the local spiderman .
and the white woman said — this is going to sound very anachronistic now — the white woman said , &quot; &quot; all women face the same oppression as women .
here &apos;s why : once they become ubiquitous , each year , these vehicles will save tens of thousands of lives in the united states alone and a million globally .
this is the work i made out of that material .
the european union ets is the main marketplace .
when i was growing up in the &apos; 70s , the typical american spent one tenth of their income , american family , on transportation .
voters elected michael bloomberg mayor of new york city .
it turns out he was not psychotic .
so , some people will say , oh , my god , are we playing god ?
and this creates a structure through which they can combine .
the frequent furl of five fingers , the chips in my teeth come from biting at all the many things a solitary hand cannot open .
it just sucked me in immediately , as if i began preparing myself as a patient to die according to the schedule that they had just given to me , until i met a patient named verna in a waiting room , who became a dear friend , and she grabbed me one day and took me off to the medical library and did a bunch of research on these diagnoses and these diseases , and said , &quot; &quot; eric , these people who get this are normally in their &apos; 70s and &apos; 80s .
so there you go . my name is john hodgman .
momentum was being built .
a couple years later , my dad took me to a film called &quot; &quot; excalibur . &quot; &quot; i actually got him to take me to it twice , which is no small thing , because it is a hard , r-rated film .
hollow organs have a much higher degree of complexity , because you &apos;re asking these organs to act on demand .
( laughter ) now , at harvard , we learned by the case method .
even though it &apos;s earth-like , and even though early in its history it may very well have harbored earth-like life , it soon succumbed to runaway greenhouse — that &apos;s an 800 degrees &#91; fahrenheit &#93; surface — because of rampant carbon dioxide .
we &apos;ve had people pretend that this is a problem that &apos;s been fixed .
a virus grabbed onto a bacterium and it slipped its dna into it .
it &apos;s equally testable .
each camera was covering 60 degrees of his head , so that in post-production we could use pretty much any angle we needed , and we shot only his head .
i &apos;ve learned that borders are where the actual ends , but also where the imagination and the story begins .
by holding the begging bowl and receiving alms ?
that &apos;s all true .
this world that you &apos;re going to be talking about tomorrow is going to be completely integrated . you &apos;re not going to be a pilot , you &apos;re going to be a passenger .
and they will be able to jump right into the project and start working on it without asking anybody &apos;s permission .
that education will work better if we &apos;ve got electricity and railroads , and so on .
but they lose , right ?
but if you get the kiss in three days , well that &apos;s three days of jittery anticipation , the thrill of the wait .
so luke , you go to your communications professors — you &apos;re majoring in communications — and you ask them for permission to come to ted , which might have a little bit to do with communications , and what was their reaction ?
second , you need to reenforce integrators .
so , bad news first .
so millions of viewers are watching those episodes .
so you say to yourself , &quot; &quot; well , that &apos;s worth something . &quot; &quot; so you go back into the room , and you break this thing to pieces , and you haul it away .
a lot of experts were saying it was impossible , and my mum certainly wasn &apos;t very keen on the idea .
ok , but he &apos;s losing ground here .
and the biggest problem is that overall , they &apos;ve appropriated the largesse of the digital age asymmetrically : we have wealth creation , but we have growing social inequality .
now , about that cow model i talked about .
the blade fell , the head fell into a basket , out of sight immediately , and they called out , &quot; give me back my gallows , give me back my wooden gallows . &quot;
but the good news is that decades of development and research have led to a lot of new technologies and knowledge that allow us to do a lot better .
and second , it was not restricted to pairs of people .
( applause ) yeah , but there were hundreds of individuals , obviously , who made that a reality .
i &apos;m feeling the sonic world around me .
this is another cartoon from &quot; &quot; the rejection collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; too snug ? &quot;
but while the west has opened on sex , what we found is that arab societies appear to have been moving in the opposite direction .
we need to employ someone to glue and to screw the sole of the feet .
computers control our military equipment , everything from missile silos to satellites to nuclear defense networks .
each of those is an outcome ; you would like something to happen .
and then we grow these things , and we tell people , back in the countries where these seeds have come from , &quot; &quot; look , actually we &apos;re not just storing this to get the seeds later , but we can give you this information about how to germinate these difficult plants . &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s already happening .
and this ideagora that he created , an open market , agora , for uniquely qualified minds , was part of a change , a profound change in the deep structure and architecture of our organizations , and how we sort of orchestrate capability to innovate , to create goods and services , to engage with the rest of the world , in terms of government , how we create public value .
the worst part was this year was the year where they decided to do a big cleanup operation on mt . everest .
so during a two-hour race , each car will be sending 750 million numbers .
maybe i should get away from this map completely , and really be honest about wanting to show you my favorite bits and pieces of rome and simply kick a soccer ball in the air — which happens in so many of the squares in the city — and let it bounce off of things . and i &apos;ll simply explain what each of those things is that the soccer ball hits .
you can say , &quot; &quot; give a muffin to a mouse , &quot; &quot; the prepositional dative .
instead , our eeg scans revealed very specific problems hidden within their brains that couldn &apos;t possibly have been detected by their behavioral assessments .
i &apos;m as certain of that as i was of the success that we &apos;ve had with direct television broadcasting , sirius xm .
looking at the entire facade — there were 70 total windows — and i knew what i had to do .
so that &apos;s my point , that you can have a big effect on these kids .
and finally , well , isn &apos;t this just intuition ?
it &apos;s been missing in much of the architecture , because we think architecture is the realm of the neutered , the realm of the kind of a state that has no opinion , that has no value .
they see us as adults , rational adults .
it would be really great if you didn &apos;t let people divide the world into the creatives and the non-creatives , like it &apos;s some god-given thing , and to have people realize that they &apos;re naturally creative .
but seriously , seriously , we did get along , because we had a common goal of wanting to inspire these young people .
so i want to give a little bit of a different perspective of how we can perhaps look at these things in a little bit of a different way .
inside there , on these two opposite sides , there is the secret of translation .
what happens in one place very quickly affects everything else .
and lastly , the only portrait of a male that leonardo painted , &quot; &quot; the musician . &quot; &quot; before we go into these faces , i should explain why i have some right to talk about them .
no crows are brought up .
but really , if we &apos;re all going to be honest with ourselves , i have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with , was it .
now let &apos;s stop and think about it for a minute .
and i select &quot; &quot; it &apos;s embarrassing . &quot; &quot; and then i &apos;m encouraged to message my friend , but here &apos;s the critical difference .
after all , my story begins with a dried , withered spinach plant and it &apos;s only getting better from there .
the realities of this new machine age and the change in the economy are becoming more widely known .
and i feel like we &apos;re sort of at the point now where we need to make that choice of what kind of future we want to be living in .
jf : you spell it right out — lt : i spell it , every letter .
( laughter ) now this may be a way of saying &quot; &quot; pure beings &quot; &quot; — like in angels — or it may be like the greek kouros or kórē , an eternal youth .
that &apos;s my question .
using this technology , the specialists at ucla medical center were able to identify where that compression in the hose pipe was occurring .
things are changing and today , on the united nations statistic division home page , it says , by first of may , full access to the databases .
if you &apos;re like most people , just seeing that gave you a small sense of elation and joy — just to think about making 50 percent more money in retirement than before .
and i posted it on my website . i wrote it up .
and learn to stick up for yourself , hear your own voice .
and our committee , which consisted of a lot of hard scientists , did feel at the end of that study that the absence of play and a progressive suppression of developmentally normal play led him to be more vulnerable to the tragedy that he perpetrated .
companies were never intended to be anonymous , and they don &apos;t have to be .
it &apos;s not so simple .
if you are a latina , we &apos;re at 54 cents .
this judge is someone you &apos;d never want to play poker with .
and looking back , he said to me that , yes , proust was right that at 22 , we are sure we will not die , just as a thanatologist named edwin shneidman was right that at 90 , we are sure we will .
31 is a prime number , and that five in the power is also a prime number .
but we take the severe ones , and we reschedule the other ones the next day .
and we actually had to install white walls to separate these pieces , which didn &apos;t belong together .
we can look at all 10 million synapses now .
this guy . who is he ? he &apos;s the critic .
in fact , no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all .
this is nepal .
they called me .
so how do i make something that even a kid can use ?
for example , there are some tortoises called blanding &apos;s turtles .
i just fell in love with the culture and the people .
no masks ...
and i &apos;m going to break it down for you for just a second .
the big challenge became actually taking the pictures through that telescope .
so just when you think it &apos;s all over , something else happens , some spark gets into you , some sort of will to fight — that iron will that we all have , that this elephant has , that conservation has , that big cats have .
let &apos;s see , should we order that all pets be kept indoors ?
ca : that &apos;s not 30 percent a year , that &apos;s — ms : yes , thirty percent a year .
but they want it to be easy , affordable and attractive , and they expect business to help , and they &apos;re a little bit disappointed today .
so what does the eight-year-old do ?
and this question is really what i want to talk about today .
so i looked for furniture .
what if we reorganized this approach ?
the pictures that came a bit later had a very simple reason .
that &apos;s a huge statement on how broken the indian public education system is .
she launches this thing above the spanish steps and sets off for an aerial tour of the city .
i didn &apos;t ask you to chant it because it &apos;s true ; i just want you to remember it .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated entities offers a new palette for aesthetic expression .
we conducted months of user research overseas , trying to think like designers , human-centered design — &quot; let &apos;s figure out what people want . &quot;
and of of the criticisms is this idea of merit .
design &apos;s power of synthesis is just an attempt to put at the innermost core of architecture the force of life .
what &apos;s the population of the earth ?
the effects of personal stress and social stigmas are a deadly combination .
to do this , we extracted enzymes from our bacteria and reacted with an intermediate of phthalic acid .
and it &apos;s something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
we &apos;re sometimes contacted by people in other parts of the world who can &apos;t travel to the united states , but would like to hear this record .
now , fast-forward to today and this is what you see : the 15 million cell phones a month .
and people said , &quot; &quot; oh that &apos;s a very very large space that you &apos;re asking for . &quot; &quot; and we said , &quot; &quot; what if we had proven that in the same space we found oil for the country for the next hundred years ? &quot; &quot; and they said , &quot; &quot; we tried . there isn &apos;t any . &quot; &quot; we said , &quot; &quot; no no , but what if we prove it ? &quot; &quot; and they said , &quot; &quot; well you can dig . &quot; &quot; and we decided to dig up , instead of digging down .
but the window of opportunity was innovation and new mindset , which today has led to a completely new governance strategy to build resilience , acknowledge redundancy and invest in the whole system as an integrated whole , and then allow for much more redundancy in the system .
and then i swap it out with the students and actually re-release that carbon black .
so , tissue design .
i myself am now collecting these cool pyrex containers and using those instead of glad and tupperware containers to store food in .
but a few years ago , i noticed a disturbing trend in leadership preparation .
so , music videos are something that i always found interesting , but they always seem to be so reactive .
by the way , check out my sweet ride . ( laughter ) since birth , we have both suffered from the inability to fly on our own .
that &apos;s not true of the robot .
that &apos;s a four percent reduction per year — and this , with measuring .
now the staggering system , not just that this worked in everquest , but that today , a decade on , every single video game in the world with this kind of task uses a version of this system — tens of millions of people .
remember we used to throw things away , and we &apos;d point to away ?
luckily , there are millions and millions of geniuses willing to gift us with their best ideas .
but what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily ?
today &apos;s commercial markets worldwide , global commercial launch market ?
and importantly , those bits of dna are passed on to the cells &apos; progeny , so cells are protected from viruses not only in one generation , but over many generations of cells .
( laughter ) so — ( applause ) but what are some other tools or hacks that sound designers use ?
and there was a young girl named jaclyn .
and so , what i &apos;d like to do now is to tell you about what we &apos;ve learned in those journeys .
so i took one &quot; &quot; no &quot; &quot; off a tombstone from the islamic museum in cairo , and i added a message to it : &quot; no to military rule . &quot;
and somebody like dr. victoria hale , who started the world &apos;s first nonprofit pharmaceutical company , and whose first drug will be fighting visceral leishmaniasis , also known as black fever .
so we could either take something long and make it a topic , like with the railway and the hurtigruten , or we could take a topic and make it long .
( laughter ) this is a very different demographic .
it is simply how we protect our walls .
they &apos;ve been doing it since 1948 , and what they show consistently throughout is that it &apos;s almost impossible to find americans who are consistent ideologically , who consistently support , &quot; &quot; no we mustn &apos;t tax , and we must limit the size of government , &quot; &quot; or , &quot; &quot; no , we must encourage government to play a larger role in redistribution and correcting the ills of capitalism . &quot; &quot; those groups are very , very small .
and it &apos;s moving through us , this self-organization , and we &apos;re extending and accelerating it , and we can be part of it by aligning the technology that we make with it .
we can design new materials , new products , and new facilities .
now , being a biologist , i was very curious about this .
he now has a chain of restaurants .
and right now this is in the okavango delta in botswana .
that &apos;s good .
so , we &apos;ll click ford , and now that becomes the center .
what it &apos;s telling us is that capitalism is going to become more social .
and we think people like this probably don &apos;t want to vote for people who look like this and are named barack obama .
first of all , there &apos;s the object in the world .
from tobacco to lead poisoning to hiv / aids , the united states actually has quite a strong track record with addressing public health problems , but replicating those successes with aces and toxic stress is going to take determination and commitment , and when i look at what our nation &apos;s response has been so far , i wonder , why haven &apos;t we taken this more seriously ?
so on the subject of deception , i wanted to quote one of my favorite authors .
it &apos;s about fighting them on contemporary battlefields .
i wanted to get back where the romance was .
second , we are both responsible for and the victims of our own pollution .
now i have beaten a song back into you .
miranda : do you love me ?
it was proceeding at moore &apos;s law pace , but then in 2008 , something changed .
however , my boss always asked if i had the data to prove it would sell , and asked me to think of product development after analyzing market data .
they are our body &apos;s own repair kits , and they &apos;re pluripotent , which means they can morph into all of the cells in our bodies .
it was approaching 11 when i exited right toward afula , and passed a large quarry and was soon in kfar kara .
but if you take a lens , like that , this line is ack , ack , ack , ack , ack . like that .
so roughly five liters of air per breath , 17 breaths per minute of the 525,600 minutes per year , comes to approximately 45 million liters of air , enriched 100 times in carbon dioxide , just for you .
larry , you can explain this one .
it gives you a sense of the scale , and it doesn &apos;t look anything like the others .
now that would give you an unfair advantage . &quot; &quot; he sued , and his case went all the way to the supreme court , believe it or not , the case over the golf cart , because the law says that the disabled must be accommodated , provided the accommodation does not change the essential nature of the activity .
so we gave them some more tasks to deal with , and what we did here is we turned the world under their feet . and watch its response .
and the big goal here is to take inspiration from animals to make robots that can handle complex terrain — stairs , mountains , forests , places where robots still have difficulties and where animals can do a much better job .
( laughter ) as you can see , these are all maps .
animators had to actually animate them .
and this just came off last september at ars electronica ; we repeated it in england .
thank you .
most politicians in my country want to roll back the drug war now , put fewer people behind bars , not more , and i &apos;m proud to say as an american that we now lead the world in reforming marijuana policies .
i mean , just incredible to see bunches of gharial basking on the river again .
we need better tools .
one billion — that &apos;s more than ever before — because of gross inequalities in distribution , not tonnage .
income there stayed stagnant , as it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world .
it &apos;s called the norden mark 15 bombsight .
they integrated with the building in really peculiar ways .
india has many because they are many .
and here we are frantically building these experiments , doing these calculations , writing these computer codes .
and this tenuous veneer around our planet is what allows life to flourish .
his story is their story .
because the social progress index also has some very good news .
it says exactly the same thing : poor kids lose ground in the summertime .
it wasn &apos;t clear .
now during the clinical trial , she &apos;d been given all her antiretroviral drugs free of charge , and her transportation costs had been covered by the research funds .
the dead zone , it turns out , is full of life .
it was less than i would pay for a bar of chocolate at home .
they were almost entirely replaced with fossil fuels , and so the consequence was that we wiped out almost as much clean energy electricity that we get from solar .
there &apos;s a whole variety of other reasons why property rights sometimes don &apos;t work in these cases , but they do need security of tenure .
and the fact that france has put food at the center of the g20 is really important .
and it won &apos;t be done .
that &apos;s very important to us .
we are missing a completely other side of wars .
but here &apos;s the problem : to catch cat fleas is difficult .
however , his chin skin doesn &apos;t look the same as it did before .
can biotechnology be used to create work as moving as music ?
at worst , they &apos;re throwaways , they &apos;re for amusement .
thank you very much .
could we use , let &apos;s say , pharmacological drugs to activate or inactivate brain cells ?
two ? so you should have sat down earlier .
inside the virtual newsroom , the reporters could gather around the themes that were emerging from the documents .
so what do you do ?
i didn &apos;t want to stand out in the crowd anymore .
look at the toxic mix of unemployed graduates on our streets , while employers say they cannot find the people with the skills they need .
i &apos;ve got something to show you .
do what you can . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so they do what they can .
and then he breathed his last , with loved ones around him , and i know that he had chicken soup also , as his last meal . &quot; &quot; i happen to know it for a fact .
there &apos;s some arduino balls collecting data and sort of measuring some parameters .
there &apos;s one last elephant in the room , the proteins themselves , which come from algae and bacteria and fungi , and all over the tree of life .
now that last mile , last foot , in a sense , is the first step of the infrastructure .
and i was thinking , how many terrorists could i possibly play before turning into one myself ?
but for molecular programming , our question is , how many molecules do we need to put in that seed to get a cell phone ?
so , this is the message of desert .
we don &apos;t even need that much time to do amazing things .
and they react . they told me what is possible , what is impossible .
now , some people call her the first programmer .
now you might look at this result and say , okay , sure , on average people are less happy when they &apos;re mind-wandering , but surely when their minds are straying away from something that wasn &apos;t very enjoyable to begin with , at least then mind-wandering should be doing something good for us .
we &apos;re connecting with something important inside of us .
much better for everybody to go off by themselves , generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics , and then come together as a team to talk them through in a well-managed environment and take it from there .
right ? all of those are man-made , artificiality brought into the woods by you , and by the very nature of being there .
we predict his eye color .
there &apos;s a ted talk on motivation that debunks that we work for money , and it presents science on how we &apos;re really motivated by three things , in terms of larger creative tasks , when we work for something bigger than ourselves .
( music ) and i &apos;m going to slow it down because things sound cooler when they &apos;re slower . ( music )
and then came the long ...
of course , it doesn ’ t matter , because it could also be that they ’ re not .
in fact , we don &apos;t know about any life beyond earth ,
this is a place called the madangiri settlement colony , which is a very developed slum about 25 minutes outside new delhi , where i met these characters who showed me around for the day .
ask them really interesting questions .
three , property rights .
there were numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment : burning at the stake , disemboweling , breaking on the wheel , being pulled apart by horses and so on .
i invite you to literally share the narratives that you create on our facebook page for citizen university .
so here &apos;s my wife &apos;s bad knee on the left , and her just hiking now four months later in aspen , and doing well .
so these projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots — 8 ft . , 12 ft. long proteins .
and we &apos;ve heard those things about &quot; &quot; is it nurture or is it nature , &quot; &quot; right ?
but what good is this for the worm ?
and the benefit to the sponsors is the sum of the publicity and societal benefits over the long term .
bang ! the gun goes off .
none of them are taught in cooking schools .
and so the next time you meet someone , a stranger , one request : understand that you live in the subjective truth , and so does he .
and these technologies are going to be marketed to all of us as panaceas for deceit , and they will prove incredibly useful some day .
this cloud is completely , 100 percent artificial .
if your enemy was really happy , why would they bother to be your enemy ?
and this has unleashed tremendous energy .
and what i see is that the animal &apos;s brain sets up its initial processing of that sound in a form that &apos;s idealized , within the limits of its processing achievements to represent it in an organized and orderly way .
talk to me . yes . yes . you can say yes .
( laughter ) sw : what about a skunk ?
and they were all eager to learn so they could finish the game as well .
and that &apos;s what it looked like .
no one outside of our lab has seen these yet .
there are lots of ways we have of avoiding and numbing and bypassing pain , but the point of all of this is to deal with the cause of the problem .
so in one of their projects called southwark circle , they worked with residents in southwark , south london and a small team of designers to develop a new membership organization to help the elderly with household tasks .
people are a little risk-averse . so what ?
and that gives me hope because people are not purely selfish .
i check and — ( applause ) i check that email account religiously all the time .
and , in fact , there &apos;s been an interesting coevolution that &apos;s been going on between wolfram alpha and its human users , and it &apos;s really encouraging .
there are so many reasons why we can &apos;t be , indeed , we &apos;re not sure why we should be .
but they &apos;re very small , you know ?
but we &apos;re beginning to see a sea change .
and they use low-intensity electric fields to fight cancer .
but the media lab is an interesting place , and it &apos;s important to me because as a student , i was a computer science undergrad , and i discovered design later on in my life .
indeed , we designed it together with neurobiologists to understand how animals move , and especially how the spinal cord controls locomotion .
and then you put tree seeds in here , and then you end up growing — potentially — an old-growth forest from a cardboard box .
well the act of drawing airplanes led me to , when i had the opportunity to choose a course in school , led me to sign up for aeronautical engineering .
and his design skills — improbable though it sounds — would be essential in enabling him to do so .
but then i would discover something new and totally different , and i would dive into that .
and so , anuj and acumen have been talking about testing the private sector , because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that , look , in a country like tanzania , 80 percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day .
i hit the gun club .
but they can adapt only so far , and then when all the water is gone from the surface , microbes have only one solution left : they go underground .
so this is for real .
what is the default setting if people do nothing , if they keep procrastinating , if they don &apos;t check the boxes ?
why did we ever do it ?
we &apos;re looking to see if we can take captured co2 , which can easily be piped to sites , convert that co2 back into fuel to drive this process .
but we break it down to some basic realities .
we call it the cloud of normality .
and it was singing all day long . and when it stops it means that it just died .
his intent is to be funny .
it &apos;s the only swim i &apos;m interested in .
and &#91; their &#93; kids will be saved , and their grandchildren will be saved , and this passes on .
and that &apos;s the growing fertility .
all of those things matter , but that &apos;s not why .
and so i engaged my father after dinner in long , sometimes heated conversations .
and in my 35 years of working experience , i think i was really serious four times .
if anything , they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already and to build on their own capabilities .
there &apos;s this fact that i love that i read somewhere once , that one of the things that &apos;s contributed to homo sapiens &apos; success as a species is our lack of body hair — that our hairlessness , our nakedness combined with our invention of clothing , gives us the ability to modulate our body temperature and thus be able to survive in any climate we choose .
the other thing is that maybe that fowler apple or maybe a variety of wheat that &apos;s not economical right now has disease or pest resistance or some quality that we &apos;re going to need for climate change that the others don &apos;t .
so we asked the goose to do it again , and hoped she would do somehow , a more elegant or pretty job .
typical post-conflict situation is a zoo of different actors with different priorities .
we &apos;re going to look at the mid-ocean ridge , a 40,000-mile long mountain range .
instead , i am looking forward to , at least somehow , the year of the insurance , or the year of the great harvest .
we &apos;re actually projecting in another 10 years the level of disenfranchisement will be as high as it &apos;s been since prior to the passage of the voting rights act .
and we &apos;ve just recently demonstrated this by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads , and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate .
( laughter ) one of the things i did just before 9 / 11 — august of 2001 — i took my son , dax , who was 16 at the time , and i took him to pakistan .
look here you have china over there , you have india over there , and this is what has happened .
i &apos;ll show an old video . kelly was a sculptor , and this is what she did with her semester project .
this entire process lasts around 60 minutes , but when the process is over , wells that shine are matched with the specific micrornas and analyzed in terms of how much and how fast they shine .
out of four british people , three said that they were optimistic about the future of their own families .
let me give you one example from the world of recruiting , where reputation data will make the résumé seem like an archaic relic of the past .
so there &apos;s deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success .
this certainly is an accomplishment that must never be surpassed .
so a tremendous fund of knowledge despite , again , that so many people told her not to do it , it was too expensive .
but there is another world .
for instance , there are two different types of facial surgery .
and i &apos;m not saying this to save myself , although this would be nice . i &apos;m doing it to save you , because if you do this , you will be lost . &quot; &quot; to be so afraid that you &apos;re standing in the face of a death you can &apos;t escape and that you &apos;re soiling yourself and crying , but to say in that moment , as fraser says to idris , &quot; &quot; tell my girlfriend i love her . &quot; &quot; in that moment , fraser says , &quot; i am lost already , but not you ... not you . &quot;
we know that the problem begins immediately .
now you can get much higher returns , of up to 16-to-one , if you include anti-crime benefits , if you include benefits to former preschool participants who move to some other state , but there &apos;s a good reason for focusing on these three dollars because this is salient and important to state legislators and state policy makers , and it &apos;s the states that are going to have to act .
this is the river , covered , used as a trash yard .
for you nerds , here &apos;s a little behind-the-scenes .
take a look at mathematical attainment by 15 year-olds .
they understand that their quality of life depends on a mix of solitude and solidarity .
and we had to create kind of a sauce .
successions of new species emerged , evolved and became extinct .
( music ) i &apos;d like to talk to you today a little bit about the work that my brother hays and i are doing — that &apos;s us there . that &apos;s both of us actually — specifically about a concept that we &apos;ve been developing over the last few years , this idea of location-aware music .
my talk will be about the impact of religions on the number of babies per woman .
we &apos;ve just come out , we &apos;re commercializing , this year , generation 2.0 of the marrow miner .
it &apos;s estimated that about 15 to 30 million people around the world have this disease .
there &apos;s water in between the skull and the transducer .
people didn &apos;t know what caused it until the early 1900s , when a british military man figured out that it was mosquitos .
and during one of our conversations , i witnessed an interaction that changed my life forever .
and we know from his contemporaries that leonardo was a very handsome , even beautiful man .
your doctor has to make sure that you are meaningfully and knowingly consenting to that medical procedure .
this is , it seems a bit dull you know .
( laughter ) it &apos;s a difficult theory to discount , i think you &apos;ll agree . ( laughter )
it was an amazing moment .
but now that the cold war is over , there &apos;s nearly universal consensus in the muslim world — and pretty close to the same here in the united states , if you talk to people and ask them — that in principle , there &apos;s no reason that democracy and islam cannot co-exist .
they &apos;re comical , they walk upright , and , of course , they &apos;re diligent .
70 percent reduction in violence on this day at least .
now , what had changed ?
so i thought i &apos;d bring her with me today on stage , to have her as a witness of a remarkable journey , which humbly reminds us of the period of grace we &apos;ve had over the past 10,000 years .
imagine designing spring .
the first one being women moving into the job market , the second one being the aging world population .
( laughter ) perspective is a very powerful thing . perspectives can change . perspectives can be altered . from my perspective , we live on a fragile island of life ,
the guardian wrote , &quot; &quot; if art is about transformation , then there can be no more transformative experience .
the point that we should be worried about is , how much strangeness are we getting ?
but for too many women , that &apos;s not the case .
but so often , they only get trained once , so they &apos;re not aware of new medicines , new guidelines as they come out .
these three people in the village sat down and decided to think , &quot; how do we elongate the life of this girl of our village ? &quot;
and this time even a greater number , 83 percent of the people , voted with blank ballots .
here we go . i want to see a show of hands .
i found myself in a state of constant creation , thinking only of what &apos;s next and coming up with more ideas than ever .
some have 5,000 . many have more .
without water , the bacteria won &apos;t survive .
in fact , it became so extreme i wrote a play about it .
now if your perception is much worse than your reality , what on earth are you doing trying to change the reality ?
( laughter ) it wasn &apos;t all bad .
in fact , those 15 million cellphones are the most connections that any country , including the u.s. and china , has ever established in the history of telecommunications .
that &apos;s because unlike apple , who will sell an iphone to anyone who wants one , nike doesn &apos;t make their money by just selling $ 200 sneakers .
typically , these things are put in the ground .
western societies , and in particular the u.s. , have always favored the man of action over the &quot; &quot; man &quot; &quot; of contemplation .
so , let me now talk about the last mile problem .
now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?
i mean that &apos;s a fabulous amount of money .
it &apos;s really terrifying .
because you would quickly realize , and maybe be confused by the fact , that there are three organizations that are constantly named in the articles .
now , what you also didn &apos;t see was that — and you may have noticed in the pen beside him and , by the way , the camel &apos;s name is suki .
now , this is bernoulli &apos;s gift . this is a direct quote .
in this case , hans had put the data together he had found from all kinds of united nations websites and things .
i believe we &apos;re at a tipping point where this is now something that we can &apos;t avoid .
and what was amazing about that discovery is that it also solved the mystery of what pollinated a unique flower .
it &apos;s got all the ups and the downs of movements .
well , let &apos;s see if we can do that .
bf : there we go !
and one idea comes from lessons from chewing crabs .
so , together these two nations did something truly audacious .
now you may be thinking that 30 is actually a better time to settle down than 20 , or even 25 , and i agree with you .
the great texts of the ancient world don &apos;t survive to us in their original form .
we think back in the glacial , from the analysis we &apos;ve made in the corals , that the deep part of the southern ocean was very rich in carbon , and there was a low-density layer sitting on top .
okay , now this gives one a little pause .
now this sounds a little theoretical , but it &apos;s not so theoretical .
and this is called blind date . it &apos;s a &#91; unclear &#93; , so if you &apos;re too shy to be really at the date , you can stay at a distance with your flowers and somebody else reenacts the date for you .
when i was a kid , i experienced something so powerful , i spent the rest of my life searching for it , and in all the wrong places .
some journeyed to the moons and planets .
so the next rule of the game is also pretty simple .
now it &apos;s more a part of our web of power than ever before .
it &apos;s fantastic , isn &apos;t it ?
i had just done the long jump , and a guy who was missing two legs came up to me and says , &quot; &quot; how do you do that ? you know , we &apos;re supposed to have a planar foot , so we can &apos;t get off on the springboard . &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; well , i just did it . no one told me that . &quot; &quot; so , it &apos;s funny — i &apos;m three inches within the world record — and kept on from that point , you know , so i &apos;m signed up in the long jump — signed up ?
( laughter ) but what if it turns out that barbie &apos;s actually really lonely ? ( laughter )
and that communication , that connectivity around the world , that globalization now raises a burden .
and the other risk , of course , is when you &apos;ve been working so hard for so long , and slept so few hours over the past months , people are tired , people become fatigued , and these new risks start to creep into the response .
we don &apos;t know if it was our handling methods that went wrong and we don &apos;t know if it was just this coral on this reef , always suffering from low fertility .
the ft . worth t has been on it for 25 years .
over the course of two years , my faithful husband dylan and i each spent over 300 hours underground , hiking , crawling and wriggling around 52 sites in france , spain , portugal and sicily .
that &apos;s our value proposition in a prize .
so the images that you saw at the beginning , they are actually a flame stopped in time while it is traveling through the bottle , and you have to imagine it was flipped around 180 degrees .
a camel .
so , what i am is a historian of medicine .
but that is a huge problem .
as a teenager , i was sketching , drawing , and i wanted to be an artist .
we can plot the planarity of the surfaces , their curvature , how radial they are — all information that may not be instantly visible to you , but that we can bring out , that we can articulate , and that we can use to control the folding .
and he called this part of the course the x factor , the potential of the human will .
( laughter ) and that — ( applause ) — in the depths of a very severe economic recession , i think that there &apos;s a really important lesson there , that if you can remember your international obligations whilst you are trying to rebuild your own economy , that &apos;s really something .
and i challenge anybody in the room to make their chest go like this .
so i did something else . i figured out 100 billion clicks per day , 55 trillion links is almost the same as the number of synapses in your brain .
i suspect there are some people out there sitting , kind of asking tormented questions , almost , about , well , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait a minute , there &apos;s something wrong with mankind interfering in nature in this way .
hong kong was a small bit of china that , for most of the 20th century , operated under a very different set of rules than the rest of mainland china — rules that were copied from working market economies of the time , and administered by the british .
just yesterday , we were having our family meeting , and we had voted to work on overreacting .
bicycles have become forbidden many places .
admit even in the year we leased freedom , we didn &apos;t own it outright .
it was and still is one of the worst droughts in living memory .
and they worked absolutely very , very , very hard .
a vascular surgeon removed most of the first rib on both sides of my body .
you know , people say how half of all water well projects , a year later , are failed .
so i was crushing up these pieces of glass , which , as you can see , that &apos;s the actual frame of the house .
because i had to , at a certain point , say , &quot; &quot; what am i doing out here ?
and this is quite challenging because now you have to think about networks of robots .
now the question , is this important ?
first of all , let me get you to the end step .
like , seriously .
because somewhere along the way , sometimes a single failure convinced them that they couldn &apos;t succeed , and they believed it .
you see banks — i don &apos;t know if there are any bankers over here ; i apologize in advance — but it &apos;s the best job in the world .
top 100 companies : how many women running them ?
( laughter ) you can see how this quickly captures your imagination .
so those are cool images . but these are ones i think are really cool .
obviously , we don &apos;t want one of those . ( laughter ) there &apos;s a flip side to it . in studying stars like our sun , we &apos;ve found that they go through periods of diminishment , when their total amount of energy that &apos;s expelled from them goes down by maybe one percent .
( beatboxing ) tedyouth , make some — ( beatboxing ) ( beatboxing ends ) are you ready ?
why could he not understand this ?
voice offstage : four point five .
the security council does its business in exactly the same way today that it did x number of years ago , when i was there 10 years ago .
so i just had to look around the boat and figure out what i was going to use to fix up these oars so that i could carry on .
pm : last night we gave it a few too many turns and it tried to bash the roof out also . it &apos;s about a gram .
&quot; &quot; everyone who knew me before 9 / 11 believes i &apos;m dead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people , so sometimes i didn &apos;t wear panties , and just had a big smile and chuckled to myself . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) this next one takes a little explanation before i share it with you .
i believe in the concept of a raja yogi : be a dude before you can become an ascetic .
so the small ones are short , and the bigger ones are longer .
on a more personal note , steve said , &quot; &quot; if visicalc had been written for some other computer , you &apos;d be interviewing somebody else right now . &quot; &quot; so , visicalc was instrumental in getting personal computers on business desks .
over the next 20 years he &apos;d have 22 surgeries , including four spine operations , and hip replacement after hip replacement .
a coffee cup will show where you can find more coffee , or where you can trash the cup .
hope you get the word out to many people and they go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends , etc .
god forbid .
we feel less accountable for our actions when we interact online .
it was surrounded by three isolated tribes and thanks to the colombian government and colombian colleagues , it has now expanded .
it &apos;s a very powerful principle .
and you can actually use it for our monkeys to either interact with them , or you can train them to assume in a virtual world the first-person perspective of that avatar and use her brain activity to control the movements of the avatar &apos;s arms or legs .
and , more often than not , they die sooner .
what are the planetary boundaries within which we can safely operate ? &quot; &quot; and then backtrack innovations within that .
this is a very un-pc cover . not in new york .
y &apos;all can see that right there .
there &apos;s a hole at the anus , penis level .
we said , &quot; &quot; that was so great , we saved this little girl &apos;s life . &quot; &quot; we were just like , you know , ah , just full of ourselves .
and in the 12th century , a line was drawn , like a musical horizon line , to better pinpoint the pitch &apos;s location .
we need to have a meal that we can trust , live long lives .
but it slightly bores me .
so then you have to make the decision .
but — ( applause ) but 2016 ! the first !
they are instead the products of downstream imagination leading to hard work , during which mathematical reasoning may or may not prove to be relevant .
i can bolster my own identity .
without human rights , you don &apos;t have the protection granted to you to campaign .
then we put a little chip , little tag , onto the trash and then started following it .
and you see , turbo &apos;s pretty intent on his flipper patting .
( laughter ) so , i made a hydrogen generator and i made an oxygen generator , and i had the two pipes leading into a beaker and i threw a match in . ( laughter )
help me ! somebody help me ! &quot; &quot; and the next thing is paralysis .
now , it was a big risk , and it wouldn &apos;t work for every story , but we showed with the panama papers that you can write about any country from just about anywhere , and then choose your preferred battleground to defend your work .
so if you were a little tiny bug living in a flower , what would that flower look like , if the flower was this big ?
for perfect scientific certainty .
and this peaks at super bowl sunday when guys would rather be in a bar with strangers , watching a totally overdressed aaron rodgers of the green bay packers , rather than jennifer lopez totally naked in the bedroom .
and when it comes to sensory restoration , we &apos;re still very far away from being able to provide beauty .
but if these machines have been around for almost 30 years , why don &apos;t we know about them ?
they have a little refueling stop in northeastern india .
you &apos;re walking by the side of the road and you &apos;re hit by a truck , or you &apos;re trying to to jump on a moving train , you &apos;re late for work , and your pant leg gets caught .
and what i love the most about this is really when the students come up to me sometimes afterwards , all surprised and a little confused , and say , &quot; &quot; i just spent two hours in this virtual lab , and ... and i didn &apos;t check facebook . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) that &apos;s how engaging and immersive this really is for the students .
i love this because it looks so easy .
so i just figured that out earlier .
( laughter ) everybody in house loved it , and so off it goes to the author .
and that year , in kosovo , this terrible , terrible thing happened , which i saw .
and indeed , you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex , which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats .
dh : whenever you &apos;re ready there , big guy .
and this very encouraging story , i think , is partly demographic-led .
if you consider a child &apos;s eyes as a pair of biological cameras , they take one picture about every 200 milliseconds , the average time an eye movement is made .
and he finished his talk with the phrase , that , &quot; &quot; the gross national product measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile . &quot; &quot; how crazy is that ? that our measure of progress , our dominant measure of progress in society , is measuring everything except that which makes life worthwhile ?
they also affect people who want to send messages , because this is really a transformation of the ecosystem as a whole , not just a particular strategy .
and it &apos;s in the six official languages of the united nations .
at the same time , while i was interviewing the red brigades , i also discovered that their life was not ruled by politics or ideology , but actually was ruled by economics .
and so , if you think about the precision of these mirrors , the bumps on the mirror , over the entire 27 feet , amount to less than one-millionth of an inch .
he was starting to look glassy-eyed .
we cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind of a foreground for this hotel .
so we thought we &apos;d just kind of model — different amounts of uv hit different parts of the earth at different times of year , so you can actually work out those stores of nitric oxide — the nitrates , nitrites , nitrosothiols in the skin — cleave to release no .
there are various things in here : i could say we might raise more revenue , or medical innovation will make the spending even higher .
five million people have taken it .
( applause ) number seven : particle accelerator mishap .
with the same method , we can also get him to circle a person .
it empowered authorities , and , as a result , marginalized citizens .
ca : it must have been just an extraordinarily emotional day because of these questions about identity , the joy of seeing you and perhaps an emphasized sense of what they had lost .
a third explanation invokes the concept of a nonzero-sum game , and was worked out in the book &quot; &quot; nonzero &quot; &quot; by the journalist robert wright . wright points out that in certain circumstances , cooperation or non-violence can benefit both parties in an interaction , such as gains in trade when two parties trade their surpluses and both come out ahead , or when two parties lay down their arms and split the so-called peace dividend that results in them not having to fight the whole time .
and partly to usa who help to provide technical advice and investment .
now , before i go any further , yes , i know it all began with &quot; &quot; britain &apos;s got talent . &quot; &quot; but my point in discussing this is to show you — i hope i &apos;ll be able to show you how these merit-based competitions , with equal access to everyone , with the winner selected via voting by sms , are changing tribal societies .
and we bring together every summer about 100 very talented students from around the world .
and worse than that , far worse than that , my sense of self-worth was kind of evaporating .
you probably went out and bought them .
what i really want to do , is i want to use this new data to try to figure out what makes the hiv epidemic grow faster or slower .
woolenness and wetness aren &apos;t exactly two concepts that go together .
( laughter ) ka : what does it mean ?
the data is then sent on a cellular network to well-equipped hospitals hundreds of miles away for analysis .
as another example , if we look at what determines an individual &apos;s wages , and we do statistical exploration of that , what determines wages , we know that the individual &apos;s wages will depend , in part , on that individual &apos;s education , for example whether or not they have a college degree .
so think about the future — it will be here soon enough .
and that &apos;s terraforming the planet : making it more like earth , reengineering an entire planet .
the wire is ready .
so in the beginning the monkey could not perform this task at all .
if the officer is honest , you get a huge penalty of being arrested for bribery .
and this exhibition is about the work of designers that help us be more elastic , and also of designers that really work on this elasticity as an opportunity . and one last thing is that it &apos;s not only designers , but it &apos;s also scientists .
and we will think about that when we look at the wider picture of the world in 1858 .
but the time now is to move from mourning and grief to action and transformation .
now we used to think that the different shape of the lure was to attract different types of prey , but then stomach content analyses on these fish done by scientists , or more likely their graduate students , have revealed that they all eat pretty much the same thing .
and every single entry had to be listened to , experienced and then based on the musical ability — then that person could either enter or not .
that &apos;s what he said .
they didn &apos;t know what couldn &apos;t be done .
listen , we have become great protectors .
they &apos;re crowd-mapping the activities of the drug dealers .
the average american used to be more than 20 times richer than the average chinese .
the second area , in brown , is the world &apos;s pastures and rangelands , where our animals live .
so before agriculture , before the agricultural revolution , it &apos;s important to understand that human beings lived in hunter-gatherer groups that are characterized wherever they &apos;re found in the world by what anthropologists called fierce egalitarianism .
and i noticed that a lot of them seemed bored .
and it &apos;s in there that those mini-big bangs will be created , sometime in the summer this year .
all right , recently i started a public art project where i don &apos;t use my artwork anymore .
dr. atkins and i debated each other many times before he died , and we agreed that americans eat too many simple carbs , the &quot; &quot; bad carbs , &quot; &quot; and these are things like — ( laughter ) — sugar , white flour , white rice , alcohol . and you get a double whammy : you get all these calories that don ’ t fill you up because you ’ ve removed the fiber , and they get absorbed quickly so your blood sugar zooms up .
i have eternal imposter syndrome .
there &apos;s certainly no quick security fix .
voice : mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow , and everywhere that mary went , the lamb was sure to go .
well , reality is a bit more complicated than this .
which brings me back to the garden of eden .
when you want the taste that won &apos;t weigh you down , the only way to go is up .
imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks .
thank you . ( applause ) ( applause ) thanks . ( applause )
second woman : dad , mom , i grew up .
that gave an advantage ; that was an implication of the technology &apos;s rise that wasn &apos;t obvious to everybody .
and where we have this gypsum strip they can harvest this water .
we were looking at dead volcanoes in arizona .
and we found all sorts of molecules , they &apos;re called halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins , that respond to green and yellow light .
i will tell that woman that my students can talk about transcendentalism like their last name was thoreau , and just because you watched one episode of &quot; &quot; the wire &quot; &quot; doesn &apos;t mean you know anything about my kids .
i &apos;m going to play a piece of music for you .
if you &apos;re in it , india , obviously , is the place to be at the moment .
we created public health care .
he went to the equivalent of an audubon society meeting .
the bottles connect together , and you can create different shapes , different forms .
but society continues to stigmatize and criminalize living in your vehicle or on the streets .
you cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water .
is this guy dangerous or just nervous ?
there are other pleasures , but this is dominant .
it &apos;s hard not to love data like that , and many people will tell you that that means that there &apos;s a worldview that you have if you speak one of those languages .
i &apos;m not going to tell you how many times it took us to make that happen .
thank you .
freeman dyson , in a ted talk , foresaw that children will design and create new organisms just as routinely as his generation played with chemistry sets .
yet , of course , like all music , it &apos;s essentially not about anything .
long john silver is not afraid of you finishing your copy of &quot; &quot; treasure island . &quot; &quot; and so it should be with us .
but i also had noticed that it wasn &apos;t working .
now this would have been a wonderful paper .
and i want to focus on mathematics .
so the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light .
it says we don &apos;t have a right to our bodies .
you put them all together , you mix them up in a bouillabaisse , and you have consumer confidence that &apos;s basically a ticking time-bomb .
the sahara was much bigger then than it is now .
as citizens , we are ready to decide on our common destinies , because we know that the way we distribute power says a lot about how we actually value everyone , and because we know that enabling and participating in local politics is a sign that we truly care about our relations to one another , and we are ready to do this in cities around the world right now .
if he &apos;s using path integration , then it should end up in the wrong spot over here .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality .
but they don &apos;t have to . they can contribute .
the egyptian people , and many other arabs who &apos;ve revolted and are in transition , have very high expectations of the government .
so , you can go to a natural source .
and i hope that compassion will be both fun and profitable for you too .
created by these very people who live , work and play in these particular spaces , these neighborhoods are intuitively designed to make the most of their circumstances .
because i want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible .
i don &apos;t know why . you know what i &apos;m saying .
and eventually after 103 days at sea , i arrived in antigua .
i was there because a colleague of mine named katrina spade is attempting to create a system , not of cremating the dead , but composting the dead .
the first is competitive , because they &apos;re looking for mates , and the second is cooperative , because if they &apos;re all vocalizing in sync together , it makes it really difficult for predators like coyotes , foxes and owls to single out any individual for a meal .
my son still had his dad .
where do we get this spark of imagination ?
but you know what the actual facts are ?
and you may be familiar with the movie &quot; &quot; contact , &quot; &quot; which sort of popularized that .
she switches from reverse to forward and she holds onto the wheel , rather than turns it .
and that &apos;s 70 percent of the united states stock market , 70 percent of the operating system formerly known as your pension , your mortgage .
that &apos;s what i do .
this is a movement for everyone .
i know that some of you here are worth more — ( laughter ) individually than the entire economy of my country .
and i developed a certitude , a faith that convinced me that i will get safely to the other side .
but you don &apos;t leave them where you found them . okay ?
several years ago , i decided to write down my experiences and my personal journey , and i want to share some more of that story with you today to convey the inside view .
today , i am more independent , but it is still not enough .
and i find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern is completely symmetrical , and it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical , or random sky .
parts of me died early on , and that &apos;s something we can all say one way or another .
they are better at recognizing other people &apos;s fear .
they completely forget .
that &apos;s not the way to solve problems .
but when we met , barack was a community organizer .
( laughter ) what can we do to it ?
and while junkies think that it &apos;s a really bad idea to expose themselves to hiv , they think it &apos;s a much worse idea to spend the next year in jail where they &apos;ll probably end up in frankie &apos;s situation and expose themselves to hiv anyway .
first of all , does everyone have the basic needs of survival : food , water , shelter , safety ?
what i &apos;m trying to say is , i &apos;m not trying to prove which system of transport is better .
well , with experiments , what you can do is answer a simple question .
and this wasn &apos;t a pretty thing .
all right , so it &apos;s here . this y2k + 10 problem is at our door .
and some people get 100 percent discount , and some people get 20 percent discounts , and some people get 50 percent discount , etc .
now we &apos;ve never seen a shadow like this of a black hole , but black holes can be heard , even if they &apos;re not seen .
but it works pretty well .
you see , yeah , perfect .
( laughter ) at the end of the course , the students got a certificate .
and in a bacterium , the crispr system allows that dna to be plucked out of the virus , and inserted in little bits into the chromosome — the dna of the bacterium .
( laughter ) or so we thought , until a woman came rushing across the campus and dropped her bag on the floor , pointed up to the sign and said , &quot; who &apos;s falafel ? &quot; ( laughter )
should i be pro-technology ? should i embrace it full arms ?
the goal of this project , which we called the hive , was to prototype the experience of humans , computers and robots all working together to solve a highly complex design problem .
case in point , einstein .
they don &apos;t draw to sell the work to a client or play the piano to earn money for the family .
but why has it taken so long ?
thank you .
do we take that william blake is somehow more of a human than gertrude stein ?
it &apos;s actually very hot .
but you can always talk to their dog or their baby .
these are chemical clocks , and they &apos;re found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell .
i &apos;m assuming there are not many people here who speak icelandic .
we mark it with a gps fix , and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen , so we could essentially put it back on the surface , exactly where we found it .
it was our mindset , because we are not behaving as a media outlet .
so if someone says , &quot; &quot; oh , i see the portrait , &quot; &quot; it may not be the portrait after a few months .
i guess so . because in a way , if a tedster relates to all the interconnectedness of all the computers and everything , it &apos;s the forging of a mass awareness , of where everybody can really know everything that &apos;s going on everywhere in the planet .
and one of my friends , now , he has a family of eight , and he supports his whole family with a blog that he writes for twice a week .
thank you very much . i appreciate that .
the high point of the public theater , i think , was in 1996 , two years after i designed it , which was the &quot; &quot; bring in &apos; da noise , bring in &apos; da funk &quot; &quot; campaign that was all over new york .
so , here we got the white area in the middle , and you can pick it up .
( laughter ) th : exactly . so why does this stand out ?
one of the things i &apos;m most happy about is that the spaceshipone is going to hang in air and space museum , next to the spirit of st. louis and the wright flyer .
and it doesn &apos;t really matter — i don &apos;t want you understand why it doesn &apos;t have the if statement , but i want you to understand that sometimes you can see a problem in a different way and rewrite it so that a special case goes away and becomes the normal case .
imagine a world and basically everybody was 20 to 30 years old .
now , it turns out that there &apos;s something fundamental about antibiotics which makes it different from other drugs , which is that if i misuse antibiotics or i use antibiotics , not only am i affected but others are affected as well , in the same way as if i choose to drive to work or take a plane to go somewhere , that the costs i impose on others through global climate change go everywhere , and i don &apos;t necessarily take these costs into consideration .
it seems to me that there is this latent potential everywhere , all around us .
many of these buildings are incredibly beautiful , and also much more effective .
all the branches of the trees , the leaves that come down create a humid area , and they take months and months under the water , go to the rivers , and maintain our source , maintain our rivers .
because what people want is what politicians try , they don &apos;t always succeed , but they try and deliver .
they have shown an exemplary bravery in confronting the brutal dictatorship of gaddafi .
but today , i &apos;m going to pick three i find interesting and share what actually it reminds me about launching new products and services .
we don &apos;t know why some cells want to do one repair pathway and some cells would rather do the other .
and this has already saved millions of lives , and it has prevented entire economies from capsizing in sub-saharan africa .
now , this movie has floated around hollywood for well over half a century , and we first got involved with the project in the early &apos; 90s , with ron howard as the director .
so here &apos;s what you do .
this kind of trafficking , in narcotics , in humans , in weapons , god forbid , in weapons of mass destruction , is part of the threat to the global commons .
we &apos;ve managed to adapt , and have conquered the whole planet .
and when her daughter was born , she suddenly found herself confronting questions that now began to seem quite resonant to me .
of course one can make a biological argument .
steve sillett and marie antoine are the principal explorers of the redwood forest canopy . they &apos;re world-class athletes , and they also are world-class forest ecology scientists .
we need an infrastructure dynamic enough to handle these seismic shifts in our population .
and i can do that in the first year and i can balance that in the next 10 , and the next 20 years , this energy , which is necessary to condition a world cup in qatar , the next 20 years , this energy goes into the grid of qatar .
the regional branch managers are getting nervous .
so , even though sometimes it &apos;s still hard , i will share with you that it helps me to realize society is more tolerant , usually because of places like this , because of ideas like this , and people like you , with an open mind .
so let &apos;s have a look and see how this works when multiple people communicate .
and in total — we just reported this last year — we found over 200 species of biofluorescent fish .
and obviously they were , &quot; &quot; is this what you spent years doing ?
but i was convinced i was going to get him to buy a license plate protector .
basically , no one &apos;s very happy .
clearly , the internet is already having eyes and ears , you have web cams and so forth . but it &apos;s going to also have legs and hands .
i &apos;m a little bit of an amateur historian , so i &apos;ve spent some time going back , trying to see the first mention of this kind of thing . and the best , earliest quote that i could find was one from david livingstone , writing in the 1850s about how the railroad , the steam ship , and the telegraph were integrating east africa perfectly with the rest of the world .
so the cost of the climate crisis is mounting up , there are many of these aspects i haven &apos;t even mentioned .
and so you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis , it will create a disc of light that we can control .
something i never talk about in scientific meetings is how i actually got to this state and why i do the work that i do .
i came across this story about the ancient greek writer , homer .
it &apos;s a waste product .
but sometimes , we have to advocate for ourselves .
these guys came up with a kit version for 750 dollars , and that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks can get a hold of this and begin playing with 3d printers .
we all have a role in making a difference .
ca : so that would produce irrigation for the entire village ?
but the thing that i know you all have heard a lot of times , american soldiers saying , &quot; why don &apos;t they talk about the good stuff that we do ? &quot;
while i was taking care of them , we got more news about rob hall .
based on this trial , in april of this year , the fda approved tumor treating fields for the treatment of patients with recurrent gbm .
what is power ?
even in popular literature , the only book i &apos;ve ever found — and this should be on all of your reading lists — the only book i &apos;ve ever found that makes the entrepreneur into the hero is &quot; &quot; atlas shrugged . &quot; &quot; everything else in the world tends to look at entrepreneurs and say that we &apos;re bad people .
don &apos;t spit , don &apos;t do anything wrong , so that the clean water can be collected .
it &apos;s about zero-sum and non-zero-sum games .
thank you .
but more likely is this .
they were all tired of the fighting .
but it wasn &apos;t just individuals .
and so it is with archimedes , the great greek mathematician .
( laughter ) text : relpy to all .
a city could find oil or diamonds underground and it would not be so valuable as road space .
i get asked a lot what the difference between my work is and typical pentagon long-range strategic planners .
but still , maybe this is something weird about my brain and no one else has one of these things in there , so to find out , we scanned a bunch of other people and found that pretty much everyone has that little face-processing region in a similar neighborhood of the brain .
but in fact , they found something very surprising .
it &apos;s not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored , because there &apos;s nothing for the drug to bind to .
because what we realize today is that modern culture appears to have adopted a strategy of tragedy .
fifteen minutes later — next question : where is calcutta ?
when the war ended , we were released , and given a one-way ticket to anywhere in the united states .
so many emotions seem to be inside of it .
let &apos;s look at this cartoon .
then it was as if i stepped back and thought that i could have very well been one of them .
adam smith , 200 years ago , spoke about our desire for a life without shame .
because where we have a surplus of technology in the cybersecurity industry , we have a definite lack of — call me old-fashioned — human intelligence .
there &apos;s something almost quite magical about visual information .
and yet , in many places , a third of the children , by the time they &apos;re three already are facing a life of hardship due to this .
&quot; &quot; my life sucks because i live under a tyrant , also known as king george .
so our energy future is not fate , but choice , and that choice is very flexible .
why are you putting yourself at risk ?
if we could reduce the usage of paper towels , one paper towel per person per day , 571,230,000 pounds of paper not used .
any actor in a democracy is embedded in a network of relationships .
at the point where you can weaponize your buildings , you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way .
as you can see , it has world class art , and it &apos;s all my taste because i raised all the money .
so the big difference today , wealth inequality is still very large , with 60 , 70 percent of total wealth for the top 10 , but the good news is that it &apos;s actually better than one century ago , where you had 90 percent in europe going to the top 10 .
this , in the past , is why you didn &apos;t mess with isolated indians .
this is about justice . really .
some part of me — a true living , breathing person — has become programmed , electronic and virtual .
the observation that stem cells , as master cells , could give rise to a whole variety of different cell types — heart cells , liver cells , pancreatic islet cells — captured the attention of the media and the imagination of the public .
they &apos;re feasting . &quot; &quot; feasting ? i was totally confused .
i can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles .
( laughter ) and the good news is i don &apos;t have a prepared speech , but i have a box of slides .
do it over lunch .
you may remember these guys .
and this is one that i did , probably like when i was around seventh grade , and i remember when i was doing this , i was thinking about that little rock there , and the pathway of the vehicles as they would fly through the air , and how the characters — ( laughter ) — would come shooting out of the car , so , on my mind , i was thinking about the trajectory of the vehicles .
they &apos;ve got an apple here from south africa .
now , our data processing on this is still preliminary , but it really seems that these phenomenal feats that the race car drivers are performing are instinctive .
so ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative reality .
one first saying that i &apos;m sure you all have heard is the fact that too much screen time makes your eyesight worse .
well , if we really think about it , we see that the business model of the internet today really isn &apos;t compatible with privacy .
it didn &apos;t happen accidentally .
as a starting point for discussion with the ted group , a major part of the problem is the nature of the written extent of informed consent that the patient or spouse must read and sign .
so does this kind of conversation happen in the real world , not just in these design meetings ?
you up for that ? okay .
( applause ) this baby is fully electric .
anyway , this project , or this experience , make me start a new project on the design of medicine .
and we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism .
everybody : i am my connectome .
this is why we have set up the governance school and the center for civil society here in berlin , because we believe most of our educational and research institutions in germany and continental europe in general , do not focus enough , yet , on empowering civil society and training the leadership of civil society .
energy use . organisms sip energy , because they have to work or barter for every single bit that they get .
just flash it , scare the guy . he &apos;s a punk .
but anyway , this is about the evils of science , so i think it ’ s perfect .
it &apos;s such a simple question , but these days , of course , simple questions bring ever more complicated answers .
all the time he &apos;s been doing 65 miles per hour down the freeway .
i got tired of seeing this happening .
they were calling it the &quot; &quot; billy possum . &quot; &quot; within 24 hours , the georgia billy possum company was up and running , brokering deals for these things nationwide , and the los angeles times announced , very confidently , &quot; &quot; the teddy bear has been relegated to a seat in the rear , and for four years , possibly eight , the children of the united states will play with billy possum . &quot; &quot; so from that point , there was a fit of opossum fever .
each question , there &apos;s a possible answer between zero and a hundred , and at the end of the quiz , you get an overall score between zero and a hundred .
why are they doing that ? because they expect investment to follow .
this room may appear to be holding 600 people , but there &apos;s actually so many more , because in each one of us there is a multitude of personalities .
since then , i &apos;ve played other places that are much nicer .
inclusive leadership is critical to putting people first .
and he said , &quot; &quot; she read it once and then she read it again . &quot; &quot; and she turned to him and said , &quot; is that our cat ? &quot;
now , capitalism has been responsible for every major innovation that &apos;s made this world a more inspiring and wonderful place to live in .
i think that the world trade center in , rather an unfortunate way , brought architecture into focus in a way that i don &apos;t think people had thought of in a long time , and made it a subject for common conversation .
you can spot it in the provocation of a button , an arm poking at a sleeve , a balancing act at a night-time curb while negotiating the dark .
i decided to take a sabbatical , in fact , at the new school , bruce .
now obviously , every time i bring this up , people even , you know , here at the conference , say , &quot; are you serious ? thirty stories ? how &apos;s that going to happen ? &quot;
the question is : how much would people like joshua bell , the music of joshua bell , if they didn &apos;t know they were listening to joshua bell ?
plastic just is not going to do it . &quot; &quot; we sort of worked things out .
nakilia invited reuben too , but — rockett : but what ? isn &apos;t he coming ?
we also have to have energy .
the title of the book is , &quot; &quot; what the dormouse said : how the &apos; 60s counterculture shaped the personal computer industry . &quot; &quot; the title was taken from the lyrics to a jefferson airplane song . the lyrics go , &quot; &quot; remember what the dormouse said .
is that likely , do you think , here ?
so — ( laughter ) and the feedback for the p.a. system is no help at all .
they were put into a segregated all japanese-american unit and sent to the battlefields of europe , and they threw themselves into it .
there &apos;s hundreds of billions of your aid dollars at stake , tens of millions of lives , or deaths , at stake , and , i &apos;d argue , the security and future of you and your family is also at stake .
and this was scene at the lower camp .
we get the generators from the companies .
if you do that , the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill .
it was terribly dangerous . ( laughter ) you could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries .
very dangerous , very impossible to do , and particularly on our stage , because there literally is no way to actually move this train , because it fits so snugly into our set .
all the while , someone is making money off of the back of someone else &apos;s suffering .
i think that &apos;s , you know , part of how it &apos;ll work .
with the service economy , it is about improving quality .
you have every boat that goes out , every boat that comes in .
it &apos;s the first time in the history of ghana that a woman has been elected head of student government at any university .
they will do it themselves .
since 1995 : less than one percent per annum .
and the vast bulk of massive primes we &apos;ve ever found are of that form : two to a prime number , take away one .
it was a critical moment in american history and global history where one felt they didn &apos;t have access to accurate information .
ca : and you made it out of what ?
i have won medals in three different sports and national games in canada , competed at the international level in basketball and was proud to represent canada on the world stage .
in 2009 , the picture is dramatically different .
mao tse-tung eventually brought health to china , and then he died , and then deng xiaoping started this amazing move forward .
lady lady , do not weep .
( laughter ) so i was like , &quot; &quot; okay . this guy &apos;s at least resourceful . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so we started talking , and he said , &quot; &quot; i really need a better way to measure proteins . &quot; &quot; i &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; looked at that . been there .
you understood exactly what i just said in english .
now , smell was the hardest of the senses to crack , and the nobel prize awarded to richard axel and linda buck was only awarded in 2004 for their discovery of how smell works .
there is nothing there .
and we &apos;re interested in how these animals are using the currents , using temperature , using the open ocean , to live their lives .
we &apos;ve operated over 400 of these , perfecting their performance with a plurality of chemistries — not just magnesium and antimony .
sure , he was handsome , but he came from mexico &apos;s corrupt old ruling party , the pri , and he was a notorious womanizer .
i &apos;d like to also thank personally the efforts of david mitchell , who is the director of conservation at historic scotland .
so you &apos;ll see the first picture , then a mask , then the second picture , then a mask .
this was in 1968 , i guess it was .
and even then , what kind of socialism did they practice ?
so , i &apos;m going to teach you how to interview people , and that &apos;s actually going to help you learn how to be better conversationalists .
basically , i want to end with my vision for africa , you know ?
in fact , applications have increased tenfold for the arcus fellowship since the building opened .
because climate change is a shared global problem , there are some really compelling reasons why we should be printing that international currency that &apos;s issued by the imf , to fund it .
she took him to the vet and the vet discovered something quite disgusting .
in africa , small farmers bear the brunt of this risk .
i &apos;m not an angel .
and i hatched the idea that there are really two kinds of identity .
and those who shunned politics , well , they were idiots .
i &apos;m talking about another technology .
we call our students &quot; &quot; scholars , &quot; &quot; because they &apos;re lifelong learners .
we start with these fragments , and then we have a homologous recombination system that reassembles those into a chromosome .
we already know climate change is a big problem .
now , as an artist , a woman , an arab , or a human being living in the world in 2010 , i only had one thing to say : i wanted to say no .
i work a lot . i mean , a lot .
the world is increasingly seeing these programs as the bridge to comprehensive maternal and child health .
none of the women i had grown up with in maryland had graduated from college , let alone considered business school .
this lady is the daughter of the mad , bad and dangerous-to-know lord byron , and her mother , being a bit worried that she might have inherited some of lord byron &apos;s madness and badness , thought , &quot; &quot; i know the solution : mathematics is the solution .
you notice here &apos;s a big jump when i was a little kid — and i think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people weren &apos;t having the courage to try .
it &apos;s more than making you feel the things that i feel .
and finally , this would enable a wave of innovation , because amazing talent can be found anywhere .
five people jumped and died , other people were killed by the smoke .
these are the dissected gonads of an animal that has two testes , two ovaries , another large testis , more ovaries , which is not normal ...
so it needs refurbishment .
it will give you the same kind of robust architecture that i described .
so , long live the altruistic revolution .
and it &apos;s never easy because , of course , whenever i do i spend much of it worried about all the extra stuff that &apos;s going to crash down on me the following day .
and as many of us think about that continent and think about what if means to us all in the 21st century , i have begun that looking through artists , through artworks , and imagining what they can tell us about the future , what they tell us about our future , and what they create in their sense of offering us this great possibility of watching that continent emerge as part of our bigger dialogue .
how can it be that not seeing the world accurately gives us a survival advantage ?
they bring them to the hospital , and they put them in a big jar .
i &apos;d like to kick off by looking at education .
now we &apos;re on the upswing .
and i &apos;m trying to play possum .
look at the client base for this .
the optimism bias has been observed in many different countries — in western cultures , in non-western cultures , in females and males , in kids , in the elderly .
