they don &apos;t know if they &apos;ll work , and they have no idea what kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash .
we don &apos;t seem to see them .
and with this one campaign as our umbrella , my organization , data , and other groups , have been tapping into the energy and the enthusiasm that &apos;s out there from hollywood into the heartland of america .
that &apos;s just the simulation creating this itself , basically .
i want to become the billionaire ceo , and then i will be happy . &quot; &quot; you &apos;ve got your own variation on that .
subsidiaries of shell and eni paid the nigerian government for the block .
this boy is called sadik .
in time , all of science will come to be a continuum of description , an explanation of networks , of principles and laws .
so is it really fair to objectify them in the way that we do , to share those images ?
his right eye couldn &apos;t see .
and we can take out the physical product , and ready to use , or to , perhaps , assemble into something else .
it also needs — it needs dignity , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s our job to hand those things out .
i &apos;m sure she would &apos;ve said what most of us would &apos;ve said , which is , &quot; &quot; no — can &apos;t you see how busy i am ? &quot; &quot; yet when she had to find seven hours because there is water all over her basement , she found seven hours .
we talked and discovered how prisons and inmates could actually help advance science by helping them complete projects they couldn &apos;t complete on their own , like repopulating endangered species : frogs , butterflies , endangered prairie plants .
i recently joined a field campaign in malaysia . there are others .
these curves for global temperature , atmospheric co2 and sea level were derived from ocean cores and antarctic ice cores , from ocean sediments and snowflakes that piled up year after year over 800,000 years forming a two-mile thick ice sheet .
so basically , if you wanted to generalize , you can demonstrate that as the density increases along the bottom there , that the energy consumed reduces dramatically .
we in public health , we hate child death , so we want less and less and less of child deaths .
&apos;they make certain points . the point is on your head .
it &apos;s a corruption relative to the framers &apos; baseline for this republic .

i hate to break it to you , those aren &apos;t other body parts controlling your behavior .
what if i told you that the two-meter positioning that our current cell phones and our tomtoms give us is pathetic compared to what we could be getting ?
any spoken language that &apos;s used by real people has them .
and you get this strange , escher-like morph from one animal to another .
so , this table i &apos;ve given just to emphasize that i &apos;ve only talked about two examples .
what does that mean ?
because generally in britain if you want to make us happy about something , just tell us we do it better than the germans .

i graduated from university to become a theater director , and that progress is entirely to do with the fact that people i &apos;ll never meet fought for women to have rights , get the vote , get education , have progress .
thank you .
but before i dive into those i want to admit that i am an optimist .
here &apos;s my solution .
i know it has for me .
all big societies that have governments , and where most people are strangers to each other , are inevitably similar to each other and different from tribal societies .
and i also ask myself , does it really work ?
we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement .
in japan , toilets are computers and there &apos;s even hackers who hack them .
i was on a high .
considering this , east germany was a very modern dictatorship .
you see it in many different ways .
we believe that we have found a way to do so , and this is the first time that we &apos;ve shown it in public .
the question of whether disgust ought to influence our moral and political judgments certainly has to be complex , and might depend on exactly what judgments we &apos;re talking about , and as a scientist , we have to conclude sometimes that the scientific method is just ill-equipped to answer these sorts of questions .
and i run a community lab .
let me tell you about mariana popa who worked in redbridge , east london .
of those that don &apos;t abort , atrazine causes impaired mammary , or breast , development in the exposed daughters in utero , so that their breast don &apos;t develop properly .
we &apos;re moving in our homes , in our offices , as we shop and we travel throughout our cities and around our world .
it &apos;s really beautiful , and it conjures up all these various different emotions , but he couldn &apos;t photograph everything , and to tell the story , i had to fill in the gaps , which is now rather daunting , because now i have to recreate back to back what really happened and i had , i &apos;m the only one who could really blow it at that point .
i mean , in the 18th century , in the 18th century you could become an expert on any field of science in an afternoon by going to a library , if you could find the library , right ?
i wanted to know their stories .
just heard that he claimed that you play the piano in an opium den . &quot; &quot; and the father says , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m very sorry . yes , it &apos;s true , i lied .
and so what are those trends ?
you could , if you &apos;re really smart , you could shine a nonlethal laser on the bug before you zap it , and you could listen to the wing beat frequency and you could measure the size .
and then we poured a big foundation for passive solar .
scott adams ran into us and asked us if we wouldn &apos;t help to design the ultimate cubicle for dilbert , which sounded like a fun thing and so we couldn &apos;t pass it up .
and the big challenge was how to understand the meaning of the symptom in this specific cultural context .
now , economists tend to — ( applause ) — economists tend to view the world through their own lenses , which is : this is just a bunch of stupid people .
leibniz , the german mathematician , talked about geomancy in his dissertation called &quot; &quot; de combinatoria . &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; well , instead of using one stroke and two strokes , let &apos;s use a one and a zero , and we can count by powers of two . &quot; &quot; right ? ones and zeros , the binary code .
i probably learned the most about relationships .
i &apos;m from edinburgh . worse news , that &apos;s even edinburgh .
the farm &apos;s incredible .
and i think that moment of completely new thought perhaps creates a freedom that spreads to the rest of other people &apos;s lives .
and i think that &apos;s a wonderful and significant story .
as i went back , every time i went , i found that my neighbors &apos; girls were getting married .
but then they suspected , they thought there was an architect behind it .
and with him , i was able to do a project that was really fantastic .
so i might ask : &quot; &quot; who is it for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; what does it say ? &quot;
( applause ) now i know definitely which one i would choose .
but here &apos;s where it gets tricky .
in india , they &apos;ve got another couple bookmobiles running around .
and so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together because we had to go back .
we have at our fingertips a cornucopia of compelling models , powerful tools , and innovative ideas that can make a meaningful difference in our planet &apos;s future .
because this is where it all really began , isn &apos;t it ?
thank you .
but in the regards to using sustainability as a parameter , as a criteria for fueling systems-based solutions , because as i &apos;ve just demonstrated with these simple products , they &apos;re participating in these major problems .
they are blind from diseases that are either completely curable or preventable .
we let people watch , for the first time in their life , a tv episode from the bbc series &quot; &quot; sherlock , &quot; &quot; while we scanned their brains .
i mean to be able to take off from your home , you &apos;d have to be extremely quiet .
and this was a moment of great pain and trauma because i couldn &apos;t live with it any longer .
we &apos;re used to talking about stars .
but this is what most schools serve .
but the small stuff , what you might call the user interface , is done spectacularly badly .
and we &apos;ve made a wayback machine that you can then go and see old websites kind of the way they were .
i want to tell you how we found that out .
and the reason that it &apos;s proved very successful is it &apos;s private , it &apos;s anonymous , it &apos;s fast , and it &apos;s cheap .
what on earth is wrong with placebos ?
i also make drawings to help people understand things .
and the avian flu is also not a good idea .
the chinese market collapsed , but it rebounded .
and if we just take that and we build from there , then we can go to the next step , which is that if the ocean ain &apos;t happy , ain &apos;t nobody happy .
echinacea , a little antioxidant to get you going .
it &apos;s impressions about blindness that are far more threatening to blind people than the blindness itself .
and there &apos;s some great ideas already in our patch .
so , about the worst kind of breast cancer you can get .
60 homes were destroyed , and 40 were damaged .
it couldn &apos;t be further from the truth for me .
so to do that , what you really need to do , you need to look at the things that the genes are producing and what &apos;s happening after the genetics , and that &apos;s what proteomics is about .
people who have lived in the same location for a long period of time retain a connection to the place where they live that many of the rest of us have lost .
by any economic standard , the demand for art of all forms is skyrocketing , as you can tell from the price of opera tickets , by the number of books sold , by the number of books published , the number of musical titles released , the number of new albums and so on .
honey is a great nutritional substitute for regular sugar because there are different types of sugars in there .
but , lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days , so , it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through .
companies tend to scale up vertically by centralizing operations in big factories and warehouses , but if you want to be agile and deal with immense customer diversity , you need to scale out horizontally using a distributed supply chain with smaller manufacturing and distribution units , like grameen bank has shown .
we need very large archives , and we need excellent specialists .
think of the collective anger in tahrir square , which brought down a dictator .
and i ’ m going to run a little experiment . another little experiment .
and the third one is : do free bed nets discourage future purchase ?
we put it out there .
the surgery was done laparoscopically , so i have just five very small scars on my abdomen , and i had four weeks away from work and went back to doing everything i &apos;d done before without any changes .
but maybe that &apos;s because in architecture school , we don &apos;t really learn how to engage the public in the act of design .
so imagine hundreds of millions of voters casting hundreds of millions of votes , all to be counted correctly and all the things that can possibly go wrong causing all these bad headlines , and you cannot help but feel exhausted at the idea of trying to make elections better .
was it designed around cars or around people ?
except , i even started painting dancers .
( laughter ) i went to visit kitty carlisle hart , and she is 96 , and when i brought her a copy of &quot; &quot; the elements of style , &quot; &quot; she said she would treasure it .
and all this had come from nothing .
we would decide to establish this charter of compassion .
lorna and judith realized that kanner had been as wrong about autism being rare as he had been about parents causing it .
they knew what happened .
i hired guys who paint flats fixed on the sides of garages to do the painting on the building , and they loved it .
just this morning , we announced the open-source fundamental technologies you just saw in the video .
so for instance , what i did when i went to burundi , we &apos;d got tutsi and hutu women together to talk about some of the problems that had taken place in rwanda .
it got this query correct : &quot; &quot; a long , tiresome speech delivered by a frothy pie topping , &quot; &quot; and it quickly responded , &quot; &quot; what is a meringue harangue ? &quot; &quot; and jennings and the other guy didn &apos;t get that .
so , you ’ ll see there ’ s a problem here , something that is illogical .
indeed they would say religion is based on faith or maybe the calculus of pascal &apos;s wager .
without actually having to query them at all , we can get this kind of a structural insight .
how did you then make the decision and assume the responsibilities of running a newspaper , especially in such times of conflict ?
and yet , it feels natural to us now .
someone who has done something like this , however mediocre and throwaway , has tried something , has put something forward in public .
for someone who wants to cure diseases , there is no higher calling .
because not many people are really going to read archimedes in ancient greek , but they should have the chance to do it .
soap opera lesson three : evolution is real .
and on this curve , riding on moore &apos;s law , are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies available to all of us .
my first thought was , &quot; &quot; well , you know , there &apos;s george bush . &quot; &quot; but then i thought , &quot; &quot; why be rude to chimpanzees ? &quot; &quot; i guess there goes my green card .
ca : snowden said two days ago that terrorism has always been what is called in the intelligence world &quot; a cover for action , &quot; that it &apos;s something that , because it invokes such a powerful emotional response in people , it allows the initiation of these programs to achieve powers that an organization like yours couldn &apos;t otherwise have .
well , we &apos;re pretty sure that it &apos;s very small changes in the amount of sunlight reaching antarctica , just caused by natural changes in the orbit of the earth .
and i found myself , after two years there and performing and learning , on the island of bali , on the edge of a crater , gunung batur .
in 2003 , i started a project with computer scientist adam montandon , and the result , with further collaborations with peter kese from slovenia and matias lizana from barcelona , is this electronic eye .
i have occasional meetings with scientists .
so who would think that it was low-fat ?
even in the midst of terrible destruction and death and chaos , i learned how ordinary people could help their neighbors , share food , raise their children , drag someone who &apos;s being sniped at from the middle of the road even though you yourself were endangering your life , helping people get into taxis who were injured to try to take them to hospitals .
and this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences .
if you did , could you please raise your hand ?
i set out to write a compelling economic story , one that had great characters , that no one else was telling , and one that i thought mattered .
and a life that once seemed brief and insignificant revealed itself to be vital , everlasting and relevant .
just last year we realized that you don &apos;t even need to have a robotic device .
tb : good choice.ed : all right , thanks , dr. batiuk .
and it had drastic consequences .
one of those things you just saw flashed before you was a raven drone , the handheld tossed one . for about a thousand dollars , you can build one yourself , equivalent to what the soldiers use in iraq .
it &apos;s got these fishing lures on the bottom . they &apos;re going up and down .
and we should , now , be able to fly in here and have a closer look .
one of the really exciting things , though , is something that came out of the trip that i took to ghana just last month .
we &apos;re advising the burmese opposition , the government of southern sudan , which — you heard it here first — is going to be a new country within the next few years .
so let &apos;s look at what this last century has been to see where we &apos;re going .
this fish , 400 scales — again , it is one uncut square , only folding .
i mean , everything is scaling up very nicely and we &apos;re getting more confident .
and instead , they &apos;ll be planning for the future and starting to build the 22nd century enlightenment .
that &apos;s basically , if you hold two fists together , it &apos;s just slightly larger than the two fists .
and if they don &apos;t know which house to target , they &apos;ve been known to drive this technology around through whole neighborhoods .
quick snapshots of things you might see from a speeding motor scooter , and very slow walking through rome , you might be able to study in more detail some of the wonderful surfaces and whatnot that you come across .
and the only explanation i can have for some of what you &apos;ve been hearing in the last four days is that it arises , in fact , out of a form of love .
your brain works exactly the same way , responding to weight loss by using powerful tools to push your body back to what it considers normal .
each little box is about a billion dollars , and you see that i pay an awful lot of attention to nigeria sitting there in the middle .
they were men who had been contractors , or they had been building houses and they had lost their jobs after the housing boom , and they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support .
we in the lgbt community have gone from being a pathologized and reviled and criminalized group to being seen as part of the great human quest for dignity and equality .
( laughter ) ( applause ) from the drop-down menu , choose the first letter you want to type . ok . ( laughter )
and you can think of this as our satellite view for our map .
it &apos;s the idea of an ever-ever-land , emerging from an ancient civilization , united by a shared history , but sustained , above all , by pluralist democracy .
why don &apos;t you advise their government on their diplomacy ? &quot; &quot; and the kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service .
now in the top 10 cities in the u.s.
if you ask , what is the big difference between women and men physiologically ?
see any common themes ? principles ?
if , however , as in pasadena , every lane is a bike lane , then no lane is a bike lane .
we need to see how we can help those societies move from political coalitions , loosely based political coalitions , to civilizational coalitions that are working for the ideals and narratives of the democratic culture on the ground .
the first is , i think we need to question this idea that architecture is about making buildings .
stop trying to be good people .
and look at this whole range of cycle-based innovations : cycle that &apos;s a sprayer , cycle that generates energy from the shocks on the road .
so that was the reason for the project .
with my eyes shut . ha-ha .
these freckles are called sunspots , and they are just one of the manifestations of the sun &apos;s magnetic field .
so this shows the average relationship between gdp and social progress .
hold your phones up , hold your phones up !
if you do , would you mind if i timed how long it took you to walk down that hallway ?
sometimes we make food , too .
and that &apos;s going to pose an enormous problem .
before we were meant to travel , my mom came home one day , and said , &quot; we &apos;re going on a little holiday , a little trip . &quot;
so , this is a view of what humans are .
and so that &apos;s what we &apos;ll do today .
but after this , we have empirical evidence that 82 percent , on average , among all these villages — 1,200 villages have completed it — waterborne diseases have come down 82 percent .
so it was the fall of 1902 , and president theodore roosevelt needed a little break from the white house , so he took a train to mississippi to do a little black bear hunting outside of a town called smedes .
and we can use those lessons to craft our own life stories .
how do you get from trauma to growth ?
we filed the patent for her , the national innovation foundation .
so , people have commented on how , &quot; &quot; well , you know , you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of pandora . &quot; &quot; to me , it was more of a fundamental way of doing business , the process itself , that changed as a result of that .
i was adopted by the bishop of the episcopal diocese during the riots , and he donated a row house . and in that row house i started manchester craftsmen &apos;s guild , and i learned very quickly that wherever there are episcopalians , there &apos;s money in very close proximity .
now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic .
but it was like sex , you didn &apos;t have to be told .
and yet one more tap , and you &apos;d be &quot; &quot; liking &quot; &quot; auntie glenda on facebook .
and so i just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there , but you can fill in whatever you want . this is not a forecast .
and if nasa doesn &apos;t do it , china might , or somebody in this room might write a big check .
and what we know is that it &apos;s as if the bees have caught a flu .
see , second time for the same player .
all these women sitting at one table from eight , nine countries , all chatting to each other , not understanding a word , because they &apos;re all speaking a different language .
when we think about how we address problems in this country , we often start from a place of trickle-down justice .
arabs were saving jews . jews were saving arabs .
that &apos;s always been the harder problem when it comes to fighting wars .
and we know money is the root of all evil , but it didn &apos;t actually stop evil from happening in cambodia , in fact .
and it is his spirit and his optimism that is in my dna .
there were parades on veteran &apos;s day — there wasn &apos;t a president &apos;s day .
this is an image of me and my daughter holding the israeli flag .
we should have been , because it made a lot of smoke and it made a lot of noise , and it was powerful , you know .
the big plan was to ask him for a 1,000,000-dollar loan .
i mean , what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her ?
now , in fact , they couldn &apos;t do it for a lot of reasons today .
it &apos;s also fair to say that because it takes so many countries to agree to issue these extra sdrs , it &apos;s highly unlikely that money printing would get out of control .
it often takes a generation to accomplish , but it also requires us , today &apos;s generation , to take responsibility and to learn the right lessons about leadership , diplomacy and institutional design , so that the child soldiers of today can become the children of tomorrow .
so i &apos;m beginning to suspect that our specialization is beginning to impede our progress at best , and at worst , is leading us astray .
and no matter what i say , you cannot untie me from the mast .
it looks like this . this is the fifth prototype . it &apos;s not quite done .
ignore the instructions , that &apos;s what the government has to put in there to confuse you , i &apos;m sure .
we said , oh , kindergarten seems like a good place .
this is where it all comes from , and where these farmers who actually , ten thousand years ago , put us on the road of bread .
or — think about it — that 60,000 dollars is more than what it costs to send one person to harvard as well .
and we &apos;re also joined by brent lawson from lawson frisk securities .
we have nestlé creating nespresso , we have lego going into animated films , toyota creating the hybrids , unilever pushing into sustainability — there are lots of examples , and the benefits are huge .
we show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the united states and internationally .
i &apos;d grown five inches and done some 20,000 pushups in eight months , and the night before the crash , i delighted in my new body , playing basketball with friends into the wee hours of a may morning .
that &apos;s the idea of creativity .
and we have 26 elephants here , and our research is focused on the evolution of intelligence with elephants , but our foundation think elephants is focused on bringing elephants into classrooms around the world virtually like this and showing people how incredible these animals are .
a pattern is emerging and it says a lot more about us than it does about them .
and i went back to the u.n. for another couple of years .
and each one of these forces split the world , tore the world apart , divided the world .
we use over five billion tons of coal , 30 billion-plus barrels of oil — that &apos;s a hundred million barrels a day .
we don &apos;t believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data , and i do understand that , i think we all do .
we make sure that the telemedicine platform gives access to expert medical specialists anywhere in the world , just by a click of the button .
i know you did because half of americans do every day .
i believe that what &apos;s mostly missing for nonviolence to grow is not for palestinians to start adopting nonviolence , but for us to start paying attention to those who already are .
so instead of having starch , which is the food of plants , it takes something rather similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate that it &apos;s burning fat , metabolizing , about the rate of a small cat .
( music ) i &apos;m a video game addict , and it &apos;s not because of a certain number of hours i have spent playing , or nights i have gone without sleep to finish the next level .
and i said , &quot; &quot; yes , i have a job . i write and illustrate children &apos;s books . &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; well , who pays you for that ? &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; no one , no one , no one just yet .
it was a gray november day , and i was overdue .
we used it in the 19th century to build art museums .
again , you can get the playback and personal contribution .
( applause ) they do lots of inconsistent things .
this is just an excerpt from one of those letters : &quot; &quot; my 12 year-old son has autism , and has had a terrible time with math .
the first time i met min , she had just turned 18 and quit her first job on the assembly line of an electronics factory .
and the stories that were captured of his life make up one of the crown jewels of histories , of human-lived experiences filled with ex-slaves .
i mean , it goes on in our private lives , too , every single day .
it &apos;s early , but i &apos;ve already , i &apos;ve got some lined up .
what can we do about this ? what are the solutions ?
most students think that it &apos;s boring or unwelcoming , so i have always designed projects following three principles .
ca : that &apos;s good .
now i don &apos;t expect every kid to be a farmer , but i expect you to read about it , write about it , blog about it , offer outstanding customer service .
you create your own reality , and you believe it .

that &apos;s why today we can use the files to get a better understanding of how a surveillance state functions .
actually , this was the first time i felt applause on the vest .
in a country of only seven million people , one and a half million were murdered by their own leaders , their bodies piled in the mass graves of the killing fields .
it &apos;s a horrific story . someone took a bottle of tylenol , put poison in it , closed it up , put it back on the shelf .
because we have real problems .
patient capital requires that we have incredible tolerance for risk , a long time horizon in terms of allowing those entrepreneurs time to experiment , to use the market as the best listening device that we have , and the expectation of below-market returns , but outsized social impact .
he wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my hopes and dreams .
can you come back next year and remind us again ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) some people say 9 / 11 heals the rift — jerks the long-term transformation gurus out of their 30,000 foot view of history , drags them down in to the muck and says , &quot; &quot; you want a networked opponent ?
here &apos;s our winner of the soprano solo .
amazing possibility .
and we get a lot of that .
so fine , we have a body clock , and it turns out that it &apos;s incredibly important in our lives .
removing the salts from water — particularly seawater — through reverse osmosis is a critical technique for countries who do not have access to clean drinking water around the globe .
i think that number &apos;s probably going to go up .
your world is ours . you — mt : as i was saying , besides the faces and bodies we give our robots , we cannot read their intentions , and that makes us nervous .
so i went searching when i started in this game to convince myself that there was any degree of plausibility to this whole crazy story .
so there are other examples , i &apos;m sure there are more to come .
if i show you 600 magazines and i divide them up into 10 categories , versus i show you 400 magazines and divide them up into 20 categories , you believe that i have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if i gave you the 400 than if i gave you the 600 .
the daf-2 hormone receptor is very similar to the receptor for the hormone insulin and igf-1 .
they constantly use the argument to devalue rap and modern pop , and these arguments completely miss the point , because the dam has burst .

not just the way we think about the world , but the way we are — our very biology .
first off , scientists have egos , and scientists like to name dinosaurs .
buckminster fuller was the kind of green guru — again , a word that had not been coined .
it allows us as owners to have other options .
the bear is a helpless victim tied to a tree , and the president of the united states decided to show it some mercy .
we call this comic book &quot; &quot; yes is more , &quot; &quot; which is obviously a sort of evolution of the ideas of some of our heroes .

so in that picture , the x and the w are known , and the y is the unknown .
bg : if you project yourself — having done the research and having tried to get permission to start the trials , if you project yourself out in time , how many years before somebody gets into a hospital and this therapy is available ?

and i cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see .

so while i &apos;m talking to you , the seats you are sitting on are currently emitting some invisible and odorless toxic gas . sorry for that . ( laughter ) so you are currently breathing formaldehyde .

it &apos;s strong and resilient .
video : whoa ! ( laughter ) al gore : she &apos;s okay . the question is whether we will be .
i was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago .
and over time — quite rapidly actually , in a number of hours — we can build a physical product , ready to take out of the machine and use .

in fact , it appeared in a porno comic book , which is the slide on the right .
and if i succeed in doing that , maybe you would go back with the thought that you could build on , and perhaps help me do my work .
so i &apos;m announcing today the start of a new organization , or a new fund within the feed foundation , called the 30 project .
in countries where these people have no choice but to work in those fields , they simply do it and risk it .
why would we want to do it robotically ?
we can do things that rovers can &apos;t do and landers can &apos;t do : we can fly above mountains , volcanoes , impact craters ; we fly over valleys ; we can fly over surface magnetism , the polar caps , subsurface water ; and we can search for life on mars .
one is the question of education .
and one of the things that i think is important is that we have to get away from this idea of designing the machines manually , but actually let them evolve and learn , like children , and perhaps that &apos;s the way we &apos;ll get there . thank you .
this production was directed by south african artist and theater director , william kentridge .

we need human cells , but we need to find a way to keep them happy outside the body .
you see , when we speak of the big bang , we often have an image of a kind of cosmic explosion that created our universe and set space rushing outward .
i also think it &apos;s not that unlikely that governments might start taking an interest in genetic modification .
the first one , body-to-body transfer , yeah , with an outside mental architecture that i work with that they hold memory with for me .
they &apos;re flying and flashing their hearts out .
now we &apos;re not here for that long anyway , but to spend almost half of our life lost in thought and potentially quite unhappy , i don &apos;t know , it just kind of seems tragic , actually , especially when there &apos;s something we can do about it , when there &apos;s a positive , practical , achievable , scientifically proven technique which allows our mind to be more healthy , to be more mindful and less distracted .
and , over time , we started understanding and systematically researching what this tinkering ecosystem is about , because that is something that &apos;s happening not just in one street corner in mumbai .
we &apos;re not all in the same boat , and that means nobody &apos;s willing to sacrifice for the common good .
this time it &apos;s sending the same message and link .

the motivational component of compassion creates ambition for greater good .
and putting that data together — you can see the looting pits marked here .
well , one or two brave souls .
and when we are able to do that , what happens ?
i think we can do that in cambridge , &quot; &quot; brought it to cambridge and they started — two women — robin chase being the other person who started it .
now , we &apos;ve seen this can work with all forms of art — drawing , painting , collage — but what seems to have the most impact is mask-making .
i thought everybody had a job like that .
this is on the way home .

you talk about what you want .
not just where you attach a micro-controller to the end point , but that the structure and the mechanisms are the logic , are the computers .
the point about democracy is not instrumental .

these people actually believe — and they have no contact among them , no common language or anything , so it &apos;s not an idea that spread , it &apos;s an idea that &apos;s arisen around the world — they believe that a fetus is literally made of accumulated semen .
now we believe that spacetime and objects are the nature of reality as it is .
because fielders are successful 90 to 95 percent of the time .

it would hardly do to eat your baby or your lover .
and he &apos;s not the only one in the world .
oxygen concentrators are very old technology . what is new , and what we will have in a few months , i hope , is that ability to use this same renewable energy system to provide and produce oxygen on site . zeolite — it &apos;s not new — zeolite removes nitrogen from air and nitrogen is 78 percent of air .
they have to deal with things like toxins and pharmaceuticals that are flushed out into the ocean , and maybe even affecting their reproduction .
and that &apos;s kind of what has been the spirit of what we are doing .
he went around once , he went around twice , he went around thrice .

what percentage lived in a house with a bomb shelter ?
( chanting ) jennifer : a soldier walked onto the road , asking where we &apos;d been .
we have to address problems at the root , and when you deal with what &apos;s happening in black communities , it creates an effervescence , right ?
and it was all the people who lived in those homes , were the ones that were actually taking it apart and working , and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart .

dd : this is something i call &quot; &quot; swinging in the rain . &quot; &quot; and you can barely see it , but it &apos;s — a controller at top cycles the water to fall just before and after you pass through the bottom of the arc .
it felt as if my brain was trying to kill me , and then , being afraid of being afraid consumed all of my thoughts .

so , here we are , a week after the olympics and down at atlanta , and i &apos;m just blown away by the fact that just a year ago , i got out on a gravel track and couldn &apos;t run 50 meters .

and indeed , i was very far from the mark .
why ? because in compassion , when we feel with the other , we dethrone ourselves from the center of our world and we put another person there . and once we get rid of ego , then we &apos;re ready to see the divine .
but now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess .
how can we understand what makes some societies more fragile than other societies ? the problem is obviously relevant to our situation today , because today as well , there are some societies that have already collapsed , such as somalia and rwanda and the former yugoslavia . there are also societies today that may be close to collapse , such as nepal , indonesia and columbia .
they &apos;re taking information from our planet at very critical places like antarctica and the poles .

most of our current voters and politicians have no personal experience of any of those things , but millions of older americans do .
this is the sort of 3d data that a machine will read .
and it &apos;s through the sharing that people get tactics of how to take care of themselves , how to disclose how to take medicines .
and even that was considered outrageous at the time .
and then what happens is , when they put the marshmallow on the top , they run out of time and what happens ?
neither have i provided electricity to my village through sheer ingenuity .
i teach courses in physical computing and wearable electronics .
( laughter ) you see , psychokinesis is the paranormal influence of the mind on physical events and processes .
( video ) voice : onicha , off to school with your brother .

everybody else at the time of google , more or less , was trying to be a portal .
it initially started off with me stacking these things , bunches of them , and then playing with the sense of space , of filling in the space . and then it started changing , and become folding on themselves .
now these are examples of new orleans rebuilding in this way , but better if others act proactively with these changes in mind .

the child &apos;s symptoms begin with mild fever , headache , muscle pains , followed by vomiting and diarrhea , then bleeding from the mouth , nose and gums .
this — i &apos;ve shown you sea floor — but so the goal here is real time interaction with the oceans from anywhere on earth .
instead of being the sole guardian of information , be a facilitator to all this information .
they gave us endotracheal aspirate — you know , a little fluid from the throat , from this tube that they got down there — and they gave us this .

they get fit together , and then they compete .
and i &apos;d heard this before as well .
in india it was just impossible to paste .

if we know what it takes to have a healthcare system rather than a sick-care system , why don &apos;t we just do it ?

i have always wanted to travel back in time to an era where maps were mostly blank or they read , &quot; &quot; there be dragons . &quot; &quot; and today , the closest i &apos;ve come is visiting remote atolls in the western indian ocean .
so a fair criticism — is what it is — of second life today is that it &apos;s more like the wild west than it is like rome , from a cultural standpoint .
older people really wanted to leave the european union .
so , imagine we &apos;re in the middle of america .
i made a film that was impossible to make , but i didn &apos;t know it was impossible , and that &apos;s how i was able to do it .
people are now confident to bring — if your people in the diaspora bring their money back , it shows other people that , look , there is emerging confidence in your country .
( laughter ) we grew up playing a bunch of , we played by ear and i think that &apos;s important for us because we were not really exposed to a lot of different styles of music .
but this last time , just coming round , right now , suddenly , there &apos;d be huge changes in the environment , in the concentration of people , and it was just unbelievable , the amount of — all the change in it .

and one of my heroes , aphex twin , famously hid in dark corners of clubs .
now , the conceptual issues are truly profound when you talk about creativity and ownership and , let me tell you , we don &apos;t want to leave this just to lawyers to figure out .
i was fortunate also , to meet the man who &apos;s sitting on the bed , though i gave him hair over here and he doesn &apos;t have hair .
i can talk to you over it without worrying about what we in fact now know is happening , without worrying about the fact that not only will surveillance be happening but it &apos;ll be done by people who may abuse the data .
and , kind of as a way of surviving , i would go into my own very personal space , and i would make things .

i had a family friend who for years used to call my girlfriend my lover .
and , as well , as of efficacy , agency .
they were doing fine .
so my breakfast , my lunch , i donate it to a charity that i founded because we want to build a school in sudan .

it &apos;s easy to forget that because of its short life , the internet has actually changed many times over the last 30 years or so .
i would like break the walls of ignorance between east and west — no , not the soft option that we have discussed before , but rather the soft power that joseph nye has spoken about before .
but as soon as i get to a place of real quiet , i realize that it &apos;s only by going there that i &apos;ll have anything fresh or creative or joyful to share with my wife or bosses or friends .

during the 1918 flu pandemic 50 million people died .
so , parabiosis is done in mice by surgically connecting the two mice together , and that leads then to a shared blood system , where we can now ask , &quot; &quot; how does the old brain get influenced by exposure to the young blood ? &quot; &quot; and for this purpose , we use young mice that are an equivalency of 20-year-old people , and old mice that are roughly 65 years old in human years .
no one to figure out what tools should be used .
the demands of modern institutional thinking is coming in .
but i &apos;m not ashamed of my self .
she goes back to reading her book , which is unfortunately titled &quot; &quot; rape . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so she &apos;s noticed the unusual thing , but she &apos;s gone back to her normal life .

he asked the question , if i take that material , which is a natural material that usually induces healing in the small intestine , and i place it somewhere else on a person &apos;s body , would it give a tissue-specific response , or would it make small intestine if i tried to make a new ear ?
it &apos;s true .
but you probably don &apos;t know that much about james watt .
and then he started clapping .
because we are reactive to the heightened venom of the political debate , you get governments that have an us-versus-them mentality , tiny groups of people making decisions .
but not too long ago , i came upon this on the web .
change happens slowly .
and that if we don &apos;t do that , the antithesis , although we &apos;ve heard otherwise , is we &apos;re really going to become extinct , because we &apos;re feeding our children to death .
so are we all .
and isn &apos;t it that strange moment when you publish your design ?
so if you think from the perspective of early metastatic cancer cells as they &apos;re out searching around for the resources that they need , if those resources are clustered , they &apos;re likely to use interactions for recruitment , and if we can figure out how cancer cells are recruiting , then maybe we could set traps to catch them before they become established .
so we need to think about , as was spoken earlier , the traditional african methods for doing self-organization .
the governments that are making the most progress are the governments that have found ways to enable shared value in business rather than see government as the only player that has to call the shots .
&quot; hello world , hello berlin , hello nsa , hello gchq . &quot;
and then this funny thing happened .
even more exciting .
i want to say that i think the powers that be know that empire-building is actually — that feelings get in the way of empire-building .
for most of the past 114 years , everyone , including scientists , mistakenly confused alzheimer &apos;s with aging .
however , the inequalities that exist between richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding pose a real risk for exploitation , especially in the context of externally-funded research .
this is the story of my brother .
so let me talk a little bit about why we need to do that , because our global commons is under attack in a variety of ways , and none of the sources of threat to the global commons will be solved by building walls .
there &apos;s a lot to talk about in this chart .
there &apos;s no suggestion of a relationship there .
i &apos;m going to have a sandwich for lunch .
i had other dreams , not necessarily practical ones , but at the age of eight , i was bequeathed a guitar .
here &apos;s a clue .
and it takes weeks to perform our integrations .
no one &apos;s going to notice those split lines and changes .
institutions hate being told they &apos;re obstacles .
( laughter ) but here &apos;s how i think i like to make change , and that is in making connections .
so i grab the dove , and for the second time i send her in the air .
it means it gets filled with hot air .
it &apos;s the same with a wheat field , it &apos;s the same with a rice field .

one is that they &apos;re highly prevalent .
those flags represented the countries from which my team came from .
it &apos;s full of us , it &apos;s full of our stuff , full of our waste , full of our demands .
generally a duty of care arises when one individual or a group of individuals undertakes an activity which has the potential to cause harm to another , either physically , mentally or economically .
but instead the entire team creates a shared mental model that they can all agree on and move forward on .
and all of the items on it are unremarkable .
what &apos;s special about it ?
( laughter ) and i expect to speak in the first session of the 39th ted india .
this doesn &apos;t bother me so much , that the underlying darwinian rationale of compassion is kind of self-serving at the genetic level .
but most of us , i think , accept some small role for the state to enforce a duty of care , and the key word here is reasonable .
now , you don &apos;t see these devices as add-ons for phones yet , but students and engineers around the world have attached atmospheric sensors to bicycles and handheld computers and cheap robots and the backs of pigeons — that being a project that &apos;s actually underway right now at u.c. irvine , using bird-mounted sensors as a way of measuring smog-forming pollution .
and the one in mono , by the way , he used the pedal , and as he got older , he said , &quot; &quot; no , no , wait a minute .
( laughter ) now , i think this is totally obvious , but the very obviousness of it raises what is for me an incredibly profound question .
she worried that the violence we witnessed would overtake our lives ; that our poverty meant that the neighbors with whom we lived and shared space would harm us .
disc1 is a gene that &apos;s deleted in schizophrenia .
i love to cook , i hosted many dinner parties , and in return , people invited me to their dinner parties , and to their barbecues , and to their pool parties , and to their birthday parties .
it &apos;s a bit suspicious isn &apos;t it ? there is two answers to the question so far , zero and one .
and it &apos;s sort of one of the other groups of people who pay a price for us .
and based on my prior sighted experience , it sounds like a pretty cool city , whether you &apos;re blind , whether you have a disability , or you haven &apos;t quite found yours yet .
and everybody ran up to me .
but the types of results that can be produced are undeniable .
so , three years ago , i got together with some friends of mine who had similar aspirations and we founded genspace .
she didn &apos;t recognize me — there was no recognition whatsoever .
the level is dropping , rather like the aral sea .
ruby taught me that you &apos;re not supposed to be afraid of the bugs under your bed .
the space between buildings will be well-balanced between people and cars .
the most important thing is to be a mensch . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) thank you . ( applause ) ( applause )
but are they really ?
with income down there and child mortality .
the dalai lama often states that compassion is his best friend .
by the way , this is something that really bothers me .
( laughter ) but not to create the engineering colleges .
i used a gps to get here today , and this is my hometown .
he &apos;s an austrian school economist who was first active in the first half of the 20th century in vienna .
in fact , it &apos;s hard .
and people say , &quot; &quot; oh , well , you &apos;ve launched this thing , and it &apos;s radioactive , into space , and what about accidents ? &quot; &quot; but we launch plutonium batteries all the time .
so if you look at the green data points , which is air that &apos;s outside , you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s a large amount of microbial diversity , or variety of microbial types .
so the one thing , though , that i want you to remember about this is that these patterns of interactions are something that you &apos;d expect to be closely connected to colony size .
this is a left-in , right-out , left-in , center-out and tie .
in our system , whether you &apos;re detained or free , pending trial is not a matter of how dangerous you are or how much of a flight risk you pose .
and yet i see it as something that &apos;s just as basic for survival — long term — as learning some of the basic things about public health .
and lo and behold , we found that we could do it .
work with advice that works for your family .
in your time , scientists thought humans could replace organs and extend life for hundreds of years .
it is really in this sense of discovery that i have a new set of questions that i &apos;m asking .
and i had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it .
it &apos;s called crispr-cas9 .
i said , &quot; &quot; tell me about the men and women who painted these . &quot; &quot; and he looked at me absolutely askance , and he said , &quot; women didn &apos;t paint these pictures . &quot;
i gave a talk like this in london a while back about this point . i said , as i say to all of you , i &apos;m on facebook . friend me .
why isn &apos;t the title of the show , &apos; a black woman got the job ? &apos; or &apos; a black woman got a job ? &apos; &quot; &quot; because without confronting men &apos;s sense of entitlement , i don &apos;t think we &apos;ll ever understand why so many men resist gender equality .
very soon , the same systems that we use today to bring music and entertainment and gps information into our vehicles are going to be used to create a smart vehicle network .
so even though you are blind , you can put your hand over it , you can see the lanes of the road and obstacles .
we use four million cups a day on airline flights , and virtually none of them are reused or recycled .
i mean , people — pamela anderson has more prosthetic in her body than i do .
i had closed all the curtains in the apartment , so in the middle of the day the apartment was in near total darkness .
so , for example , the middle line there , 0.1 watts per square meter , is the energy consumption per unit area of saudi arabia , norway , mexico in purple , and bangladesh 15 years ago .
and two years after this photo was taken , she passed away , and i attended her wake , and nothing could have prepared me for what i saw there , because next to her casket was this painting , and her husband told me it meant so much to her that i had acknowledged her hard work , i had validated what she did .
the state still matters .
as usual , there &apos;s a dozen kids there waiting to get picked up , but this time , the children &apos;s faces look weirdly similar , and you can &apos;t figure out which child is yours .
for instance , the tunnel diode , a component used in electronics , works thanks to the wonders of quantum tunneling .
try to imagine what the surface of titan might look like .
and these guys paint humongous paintings , and they look really good .
and it exists with the educated urban class , also .
and the way it works is , it comes from the southwest .
( applause ) bruno giussani : harry , even if you just said the science may not have some answers , i would like to ask you a couple of questions , and the first is : building something like the lhc is a generational project .
one of the very interesting facts is that , in addition , we find that even once we hold constant , statistically , the effect of your own education , the education of everyone else in your metropolitan area also affects your wages .
you can lead a good , ethical life , but some bad phraseology in a tweet can overwhelm it all , become a clue to your secret inner evil .
you may recognize a couple of the miners there .
now , take into account the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe , ok , a three-dimensional space .
now , i &apos;m not predicting 200 years of chaos as a result of this . 50 .
and west antarctica cropped up on top some under-sea islands , is particularly rapid in its melting .
relative to the universe , it &apos;s just up the road .
but we have to recognize that we have those limitations .
is all of our brain going to start to shrink and atrophy like that ?
i &apos;ve actually eaten seven of those baskets and they &apos;re very good .
( applause ) and so the significance is that we have now developed this model that is helping us , not only finally with evaluation , assessing what works .
david hockney talks about how the appreciation of this very glamorous painting is heightened if you think about the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash , which only took a fraction of a second to happen .
my best man , i told him he could surprise me , and he thought this would be hilarious , but this is not something .
it &apos;s decades old , but it &apos;s becoming very trendy among police forces around the planet lately , it seems , and according to my experience as a non-voluntary breather of it , tear gas has two main but quite opposite effects .
and the town has really embraced it .
and the corollary , of course , is that any further changes that could significantly change the substrate of thinking could have potentially enormous consequences .
let &apos;s continue with that same excerpt .
gh : well , one of the glorious things that &apos;s starting to happen now is that the collapse of these systems and the consequences are becoming obvious .
so i had to launch a very expensive salvage operation and then wait another nine months before i could get back out onto the ocean again .
when the books were first published , i invited her to the book launch party , and in front of everyone there , everyone she had fed over the years , i gave her a piece of artwork and some books .
i just wanted you to know that .
but in niger , for example , less than seven percent of the children are breastfed for the first six months of life , exclusively .
( laughter ) two letters , an l and an o , now a worldwide force .
so just to let you see what is the code of life .
simple designs for infection control had not been thought about , and people had died because of it .
you know , what i do is write for children , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most widely read children &apos;s author , in fact .
in other words , if democracy is to be rebuilt , is to become again vigorous and vibrant , it is necessary not just for the public to learn to trust their politicians , but for the politicians to learn to trust the public .
and i &apos;m going to show you a sample of the piece , &quot; from conception to birth . &quot;
this suggests to me that life causing these mass extinctions because it did is inherently anti-gaian .
that &apos;s not their role ; they &apos;re supposed to read what we write .
they include exploration , which is about going for quantity ; building , and thinking with your hands ; and role-play , where acting it out helps us both to have more empathy for the situations in which we ’ re designing , and to create services and experiences that are seamless and authentic .
i don &apos;t want to take you through the gory details , i just want to tell you about some of the amazing features of this product .
people are learning more things about it .
you have to give to receive .
well , you know , i think the answer is very simple : working with nature , working with this tool set that we now understand , is the next step in humankind &apos;s evolution .
now , the advantage of studying our own galaxy is it &apos;s simply the closest example of the center of a galaxy that we &apos;re ever going to have , because the next closest galaxy is 100 times further away .
it means that violence , the rule of warriors and despotic chiefs , the conditions of camps and warfare , of riot and tyranny , give place to parliaments where laws are made , and independent courts of justice in which over long periods those laws are maintained .
this is in portland . that is an actual development .
it &apos;s beginning to grow tremendously .
it &apos;s the greenest building in the world .
she shows us , trains us how to do and how to be better &#91; people &#93; and how to do long hours in surgery — 300 patients per day , 10 , 20 surgeries , and still you have to manage the camp — that &apos;s how she trains us .
what is that number ? half a billion ? a billion ? what is that number ?
that &apos;s walking abraham &apos;s path .
but that ’ s not really true : you can be a serious professional adult and , at times , be playful .
that can actually hardly be seen from the canal tours .
you can do that quite fast .
this is a refrigerator factory , churning out airplanes for world war ii .
imagine : many of these problems could be prevented if these babies were just kept warm .
( applause ) thank you . thank you . thank you .
wonderful job onstage .
farmers are facing challenges of drought from asia to africa , from australia to oklahoma , while heat waves linked with climate change have killed tens of thousands of people in western europe in 2003 , and again in russia in 2010 .
and in the ideal case , the hypothesis isn &apos;t just an idea : ideally , it is a law of nature .
this is how it looks like in practice . we have this grass we want to get rid of .
the crisis is almost certainly deepening around us .
i don &apos;t belong in this street .
hourly simulations show that largely or wholly renewable grids can deliver highly reliable power when they &apos;re forecasted , integrated and diversified by both type and location .
in fact , i &apos;d go so far as to say , if you don &apos;t already have a nerd in your life , you should get one .
and i &apos;m going to try and show that at the end , and the suspense will be as much mine if it works .
in short , can we carve out a future which is peaceful and mutually prosperous , or are we looking at a great challenge of war or peace ?
so i was told about 10 years ago that this would never happen , that this was close to impossible .
here is the critical difference between these : lolcats is communal value .
a much more powerful approach to public health — imagine what might be possible .
rb : dropping in for tea .
let &apos;s fast-forward just 15 years from now .
( applause ) chris anderson : sendhil , thank you so much .
it &apos;s completely mechanical , again , a printer .
it &apos;s transparent with blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz of a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live their lives in public .
a health crisis makes people do all sorts of risky things , like quitting a job or jumping out of an airplane and , in the case of my sister , saying &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; to several therapy sessions , during which we got down to the marrow .
( applause ) thank you .
a lot of things are going through your head .
we didn &apos;t have the luxury of pre-recorded samples of speech for those born with speech disorder .
changes the way medicine works .
we do still use fortran .
it &apos;s just actually — you see , this is folding up — it &apos;s behind the seat .
you now have control over your own destiny .
speaking of gandhi , he was a recovering lawyer , as i &apos;ve heard the term , and he was called to a greater cause , something that mattered to him , he couldn &apos;t not do .
now , four years ago , chris lost his job , unfortunately , as an art buyer at macy &apos;s , and like so many people , he struggled to find a new one during the recession .
voice 1 : it &apos;s coming again . voice 2 : new wave ?
they develop science that makes it easier and easier to do .
so once again , we see that these two graphs are actually saying the same thing .
so crisis leading into opportunities .
but that is expensive .
we &apos;re going to do something that in recent years we &apos;ve started : take a mucus sample .
friendship , altruism , compassion , service – all the perennial truths that we talked about that are part of all religion and all cultures — once you stop trying to see the differences , these are the things in our own self-interest , because they free us from our suffering and from disease .
but look , i can prove to you that they &apos;re straight because i can take any one of these lines , and i can fold along it .
so , a couple spreads from the book : here mcluhan says , &quot; the new media are not bridges between man and nature ; they are nature . &quot;
( laughter ) but when we dug deeper , we didn &apos;t find corruption in the classic sense : slimy gangsters lurking in the darkness , waiting to grease the palms of their friends .
how could i share my sense of rome , my understanding of rome ?
well , when he was oil minister , he awarded an oil block now worth over a billion dollars to a company that , guess what , yeah , he was the hidden owner of .
but in my first 25 years of career , i had a bunch of different experiences .
because what the facts are telling us is that the long , slow journey , humanity &apos;s long , slow journey of equality , is actually speeding up .
and early in the morning , i went into the ward .
karstic regions cover almost 20 percent of the continents &apos; surface , and we know actually that speleologists in the last 50 years have explored roughly 30,000 kilometers of cave passages around the world , which is a big number .
wk : yeah . i test .
our democracies are weakened in the global economy with players that can evade laws , evade taxes , evade environmental or labor standards .
and we ’ re only just beginning to grasp it .
the original version of the story , the one that i tried last summer , that pairs the personal questions with four minutes of eye contact , was referenced in this article , but unfortunately it was never published .
in contrast , i took a plate with six one-dollar bills , and i left those plates in the same refrigerators .
so , as a last thought , i think that integrating information to everyday objects will not only help us to get rid of the digital divide , the gap between these two worlds , but will also help us , in some way , to stay human , to be more connected to our physical world .
i was born in switzerland and raised in ghana , west africa .
should &apos;ve been a dancer .
maybe sometime in the future , we will .
how about counting every calorie ?
and indeed , unfortunately , if you navigate by needs you get a very unfocused agenda , because in these situations , needs are everywhere , but the capacity to implement change is very limited .
at the time , what they thought distinguished science was a radical idea about things unseen , known as empiricism .
women used to get really debilitating surgeries to excise all of the axillary lymph nodes .
and this is how the tamper-proof drug industry was invented .
they &apos;re carrying instruments that are actually taking data down to 2,000 meters .
so now , i started from the big problem , and i couldn &apos;t answer it .
and there the simple version of the message is it &apos;s moving from west to east .
so you put human growth hormone in , the person grows taller , or you put x in and the person gets fatter or loses metabolism or does a whole series of things , but you &apos;re altering the functions in a fundamental way .

and when they began on this corner and wrapped around the entire hospital , they were so good at putting these stones together , they asked us if they could take down the original wall and rebuild it .
( laughter ) but as you &apos;re thinking about this , one of the interesting things is how small these mutations are and where they take place .
car-sharing was actually invented in europe .

we built our first prototype drones in switzerland .
eythor bender : we are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device , this new exoskeleton this year .
if we go down the small pathway a little bit farther , we &apos;re entering the era of nanomedicine , the ability to make devices super small to the point where we can design red blood cells or microrobots that will monitor our blood system or immune system , or even those that might clear out the clots from our arteries .
so this is a pattern that assumes we &apos;re all in this together .

this particular idea , however — although we don &apos;t yet know whether it &apos;s right or wrong , and at the end i &apos;ll discuss experiments which , in the next few years , may tell us whether it &apos;s right or wrong — this idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century and continues to inform a lot of cutting-edge research .
i always get goosebumps every time i see it .
it &apos;s not in the abstract ; it &apos;s the interaction with the environment .
the fact that they &apos;re not right in front of us , the fact , of course , that they &apos;re of a different nationality or race , none of that seems morally relevant to me .

we have demonstrated that our model works .
but you go to rwanda — a very small country — 8,000 mothers with hiv who are pregnant .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about .
any of one of these journalists , they could have broken the pact .
how far can we take it ?
but at the same time , we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work .
there are great discoveries yet to be made down there , fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution and possibly bioactive compounds that could benefit us in ways that we can &apos;t even yet imagine .
sometimes the object will slide across the table , sometimes it will not .
and it got to the point where every time i walked up to a table that had a kid anywhere between three and 10 years old , i was ready to fight .
this is actually a period of dramatic change in which it doesn &apos;t take learning , per se , to drive the initial differentiation of the machinery of the brain .

and become the largest economy in the world .

that &apos;s my little son .
and instead of asking the question , &quot; &quot; how long until i see a head-tail-head ? &quot; &quot; — you can ask , &quot; &quot; how big will the chunks be when i use a restriction enzyme which cuts whenever it sees g-a-a-g , for example ?
their plumbing system turns off , so the sites have to move .
and these metals accumulate as minerals on the surface of the bacteria .
we believe that the markets is this magic pot that obeys only one command : make more money .
so what i &apos;m asking for is the creation of a new job title — i &apos;ll come to this a little later — and perhaps the addition of a new word into the english language .

what we do know is that the corals are going to get hit hard .
and what he showed in mantis shrimp is that they use what &apos;s called a &quot; &quot; catch mechanism , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; click mechanism . &quot; &quot; and what this basically consists of is a large muscle that takes a good long time to contract , and a latch that prevents anything from moving .
it says here that this is the ocean plane of the future .
what was interesting about their ruling and about the discussion we &apos;ve just had is that the discussion about the right , the justice , of the matter depended on figuring out what is the essential nature of golf .

this was actually used by the mayans as an artificial tooth replacement .
there is even a photo studio where you see the sort of aspiration to live in a real house or to be associated with a faraway place , like that hotel in sweden .
going deeper into the legacy of the eastern european regimes , i worked for several months on a story about the effects of industrial pollution , where there had been no regard for the environment or the health of either workers or the general population .

you don &apos;t think about how nicole kidman is maneuvering that dress — she just looks completely natural .
they &apos;ve got that wryly smile on their mouth .
those are the critical questions , and what we have learned from pisa is that , in high-performing education systems , the leaders have convinced their citizens to make choices that value education , their future , more than consumption today .
so in 2007 , our team won half a million dollars by placing third place in this competition .
but this depends on choosing a voluntary simplicity , growing qualitatively , not quantitatively .

they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; oh , ms. diversity lady , we &apos;re so glad you &apos;re here &quot; &quot; — ( laughter ) — &quot; but we don &apos;t have a biased bone in our body . &quot;
this is a 3d printer .
it you slow down , you reduce the amount of noise you make and you reduce the risk of collision .
it can do a tremendous amount of things .
abed would say , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; i then began to wonder , as i had many times before , how my life would have been different had this man not injured me , had my genes been fed a different helping of experience .
it &apos;s a closely held secret for reasons i don &apos;t know .

finally , you can see i did have a choice to choose one of the three quotes with which i wanted to start my lecture .

now , that &apos;s also wrong , because traffic happens to be a nonlinear phenomenon , meaning that once you reach above a certain capacity threshold then congestion starts to increase really , really rapidly .
my cuban mother , which i just briefly introduced you to in that short character sketch , came to the united states one thousand years ago .
but watch what happens when we make some of them disappear . right .
it &apos;s a heartbreaking , excruciating conversation .
those decisions are made by the ministry of health or by foreign donors , and it just kind of shows up .
that was the power of that word that he was able to do .
i mean , obviously the orchestra musicians playing beautifully , the vienna philharmonic orchestra .
and so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side or stack them up .
i came to the heart institute in 2006 , as part of my elective in my anesthesia and intensive care program .
so this is how much people agree with the conclusions with no image .
or had raided their frat parties in the middle of the night ?
bg : who should be providing this support ?
then the old lady came towards me with a rusty-looking knife , one of the sharp knives , orange-looking , has never seen water or sunlight before .
but we simply cannot reach new heights and create an even higher garbage dump , one that &apos;s out of this world .
so moving to our second commandment that i wanted to show you .
so you — it was fun to get away from high school — ( laughter ) — because i was very small , and i was no good in sports , or anything like that .
they didn &apos;t have data and statistics .
who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution ? universities ? forget about it !
of course , if anybody asked me then , &quot; where is your home ? &quot;
i didn &apos;t quite get it . and paul rand was a kind of crusty designer , you know , a crusty designer , like a good — kind of like a good french bread ?

these are members of my graduating class , 1986 .
we &apos;ve taken those circular fish-eye lens cameras , and we &apos;ve done some optical correction , and then we can bring it into three-dimensional life .
it was able — but only it was able — to organize health care , education , policing , justice .
if you noticed , in mountain home , there are trailer parks and trailers all over the place .
and the more you can recline , in a way , the better it is .

by the &apos; 70s , home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets — and we all have our favorites , actually — made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home .
and what we found was that indeed there was a correlation .
every time he paints these disturbing images , he sees them less or not at all .
but i think we &apos;re a lot closer to erring on the side of not comprehending the situation clearly enough , than in comprehending it so clearly that we just can &apos;t , you know , get the army out to kill terrorists .
and i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re here and that i &apos;m meeting you here at ted .
dogs get so abused .
he &apos;s now going to use the other thing which is essential , and that &apos;s his voice .
but can you imagine how many might have if the police had stopped those kids and searched their pockets for drugs as they walked to class ?
so , my kind of hero for this in the natural world are these tropical frogs .
the question of transformation in africa really is a question of leadership .
most of them did not go .
it wasn &apos;t a &quot; &quot; hindu rate of growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracies can &apos;t grow . &quot; &quot; actually india could .
and it &apos;s at this new frontier that we are forced with a new appraisal .
the other interesting thing for us — we like sensors — is this idea that you could have an on-ramp for the internet of things .
let &apos;s look at today .
so it could happen .
this seems to me both a deeply moving and a convincing re-statement of christian belief about god .
rng : that sort of co-option is all in the job description of reason .
it &apos;s called smart failure . why ? because you can &apos;t put it on your c.v.
so if we were to zoom into this guy &apos;s head , one of the things that you would see there is that there are no lymphatic vessels in the brain .
the united states , at this point , was putting pressure on all its arab allies , including tunisia , to stamp out extremism in their societies , and this imam found himself suddenly in the crosshairs of the tunisian intelligence service .
the reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure is not because giant squid eat jellyfish , but it &apos;s because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light when it &apos;s being chewed on by a predator and its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of a larger predator that will attack its attacker and thereby afford it an opportunity for escape .
a few months ago , i got a phone call from a nursing home where i work .
it is man-made and can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings . &quot; &quot; i want to end by saying it &apos;s been the actions of thousands of ordinary human beings doing — i think — extraordinary work , that have actually improved health , and , maybe only in a small way , reduced poverty .
and this , of course , is the basis of much of eastern philosophy , and that is there is no real independent self , aloof from other human beings , inspecting the world , inspecting other people .
and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong , powerful and athletic person well into the future .
but i can assure you that this woman in the favela in rio , she wants a washing machine .
they just want their own pain to end .
( laughter ) and i wanted it not just for myself but i wanted it for my students as well .
she was telling me how her treatment was leveraging specific properties of our vascular system .
something that exists as a series of interactions over time ?
it &apos;s a liberation from our misconceptions , and it &apos;s an incentive to not expect so much from ourselves and to simply begin .
you &apos;re probably aware that there have been a spate of those directed against the u.s. financial sector since 2012 .
but what if it was coordinated with the dozens of other acts of nonviolent resistance that have taken place against isis ?
this is kind of like something i used to do in third grade .
so that at the end of the treatment , you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment .
fact is , we &apos;re living in the most peaceful moment in human history .
now , if i &apos;ll take you through — this is an early concept sketch — take you through kind of a mixture of all these things together .
this is the city hall over here somewhere , and the courthouse .
here is where we want you to channel this money . &quot; &quot; each one should not be an entrepreneur going out and finding what is best .
number two : a declining population means scarce labor .
what we didn &apos;t realize is just how many people were ready and waiting to put the bias aside .
( laughter ) it was a man called brian , who runs a crack team of scientologists who are determined to destroy psychiatry wherever it lies .
now , it looks like you &apos;re doing yourself out of a job , but you &apos;re not . you &apos;re actually making yourself more useful .
the retina chip extracts four different kinds of information .
and on the right-hand side , we show the same data , but here with daily incidence .
mounted on roads or on police cars , automatic license plate readers capture images of every passing car and convert the license plate into machine-readable text so that they can be checked against hot lists of cars potentially wanted for wrongdoing .
but then there &apos;s a lot of problems that come with meat production , and we &apos;re being faced with that more and more often .
and if you look at things like the iphone app , the fraction is considerably larger .
we raised 200 million dollars in a specialty fund to work on a pandemic in biodefense .
nothing about that would have been problematic to the child at all .
child survival is the new green .
because primarily of the power of the internet , people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money that can change the world for some public good if they all agree .
that all depends on our motivation .
that means that ballplayer batted safely , hit safely three times out of 10 at bats .
there was the washing of hands .
ordinary homeowners and renters have saved more than 250 million dollars on their energy bills , and we &apos;re just getting started .
thank you .
but all this excitement led to the press writing about us .
it &apos;s neither magmatic or volcanic in origin , and again , over 700 kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center .
i had become a mother and he was celebrating his 77th birthday , and suddenly i was very , very afraid .
and for motivation , we used what i think is the most powerful pharmacology of switzerland : fine swiss chocolate .
you can go to orcatech.org — it has nothing to do with whales , it &apos;s the oregon center for aging and technology — to see more about that .
when diane hatz worked on &quot; &quot; the meatrix , &quot; &quot; her video that spread all across the internet about the way farm animals are treated , she didn &apos;t invent the idea of being a vegan .
but of course , as an end user , you don &apos;t see that , because you only see the name of the company , not where it was developed .
we could go back to babbage &apos;s machine and just make it tiny . all those things are computers .
the procedures that make this work have been perfected , as i said , by paul farmer and his team in their work in rural haiti over the last 20 years .
the other thing : i wanted to give indigenous people a voice .
it &apos;s not just a root supplying a plant , but for each of those plants , whatever it is — a presentation , an analysis , somebody &apos;s looking for patterns in the data — they get to look at all the data and they get it connected together , and the really important thing about data is the more things you have to connect together , the more powerful it is .
and we got a great group of people to join us — principled people with great skills , and investors with a vision and values to match ours .
it &apos;s a touch device that we have developed based on these algorithms , using standard graphics gpus .
but it &apos;s worth recalling wittgenstein &apos;s remark on the subject : &quot; &quot; tell me , &quot; &quot; he asked a friend , &quot; &quot; why do people always say it was natural for man to assume that the sun went &apos; round the earth , rather than that the earth was rotating ? &quot; &quot; and his friend replied , &quot; &quot; well , obviously , because it just looks as though the sun is going round the earth . &quot; &quot; wittgenstein replied , &quot; &quot; well , what would it have looked like if it had looked as though the earth was rotating ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) science has taught us , against all intuition , that apparently solid things , like crystals and rocks , are really almost entirely composed of empty space .
this shows you the positions of some of these dams .
and we had not — i mean , we weren &apos;t frightened by it .
and you can scroll around and see some of the different airports and the different patterns that they have .
and i was having fun with it .
when you see the headlines of your newspaper these days with the war in iraq or in syria — aid worker abducted , hostage executed — but who were they ?
conservation group gets together , tries to figure out how to breed an animal that &apos;s almost extinct .
it seemed that nothing could stop this relentless industrial machine .
and we need to diversify our farms .
there &apos;s another hub in london , now , and the rest are getting set up . we hope to give the data away at some stage . that &apos;s a complicated issue about making it available to the rest of the world .
and it has to be solvable in a magazine .
there &apos;s germany at 13th , the u.s. comes 21st , mexico comes 66th , and then we have some of the big developing countries , like russia at 95th , china at 107th .
and so i started getting amazing amounts of hate mail , death threats even .
and that includes nature , and nurture , and what i refer to as nightmares .
one thing that brings us close to home is we look at dick cheney &apos;s device , he had a device that pumped blood from an aorta to another part of the heart , and as you can see at the bottom there , it was controlled by a computer controller , and if you ever thought that software liability was very important , get one of these inside of you .
plastic is the defining feature of cheap electrical goods .
for this particular problem , we designed a new category of worker who , like a sars worker or someone looking for bird flu , might find first cases .

but then a couple of years later , when i was a company commander , i went out to the national training center .
you all got crisper drawers ?
they don &apos;t play 10 hours of action games in a row .
it is possible the answers we have are wrong , it is possible the questions themselves are wrong .
and i ran up the stairs , and there was one of my favorite books of all time , &quot; &quot; travels on my elephant &quot; &quot; by mark shand — i don &apos;t know if any of you know it .
so you &apos;re ( laughter ) you &apos;re really bored in the subway , and you kind of stare at something .
i can tap into thousands of people &apos;s minds . &quot; &quot; and the other nerdy side of me thought , &quot; &quot; this is horrible . this is completely bizarre .
so if you zoom in , what they &apos;re doing is holding these large molecules — nucleotides — together .
but nevertheless , neuroscience is turning up more and more in marketing .
so much for velcro , right ?
if , on the other hand , we need to look them all up , we may be in trouble .
i &apos;m going to show you some examples that i &apos;ve run into during my time at twitter — these are all real examples — of situations that at first seemed cut and dried , but the truth of the matter was something altogether different .
fifty percent of all the money that they earn or get gifted , 50 percent goes in their house account , 50 percent goes in their toy account .
and they &apos;re doing pretty well , but they &apos;ve got a bit of trouble .
we start with poverty .
sophos _ visitors , sansemea , companies i work with .
the reason for this is the way we make decisions .
but the problem is they &apos;re very fragmented .
so imagine that you &apos;re the participant in one of our experiments . you come into the lab , you see this computerized task .
we went down to the airfield early because this is the army and you always go early .
toxo infects mammals , a wide variety of mammals , but it can only sexually reproduce in a cat .
50 kilos for the entire fuselage .
so at the end , i had a settlement with them .
both of them create great public experiences of shared ritual .
there was no fishing , there was no pollution , there was no coastal development , and the reef is on a full-bore recovery .
in 1975 , muhammad ali gave a lecture at harvard university .
and this has become such a norm of our professional lives , such a norm and such an expectation .
they are mulling whether they &apos;re going to take it further .
and like a lot of people , i thought government was basically about getting people elected to office .
we are more closely related to the chimp and the bonobo than the african elephant is to the indian elephant , as jared diamond pointed out in one of his early books .
and , of course , arctic communities are toast .
it &apos;s not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have .
many in my generation — because of well-intentioned parenting and self-esteem education — were socialized to believe that we were special little snowflakes — ( laughter ) who were going to go out and save the world .
it &apos;s very easy , win the million dollars .
if someone then tries to reuse it , it locks and breaks afterwards .
by the early 20th century , the perfect balance of science and art had finally been struck with the emergence of medical illustrators .
and trust is established , not by some big institution , but by collaboration , by cryptography and by some clever code .
debbie has worked all her life , pays taxes , supports herself month to month , proud of the american dream , a dream that just won &apos;t be complete without higher education .
in the last nine years , he &apos;s been arrested 13 times , and jailed for a total of 130 days on that panhandling case .
so you have caught flesh-eating disease if you caught that one .
but these are people that you will probably never believe .
now , i explained this growth of complexity by reference to something called &quot; &quot; non-zero sumness . &quot; &quot; assuming that a few of you did not do the assigned reading , very quickly , the key idea is the distinction between zero-sum games , in which correlations are inverse : always a winner and a loser .
that doesn &apos;t detract from the fact that it &apos;s positive , but it means more people have to share in those benefits and recognize them .
we also changed the way we did criminal prosecutions .
and anyone who is interested in doing it in any health care situation , we will be happy to assist you and tell you how we &apos;ve done it , and how you can do it . if we do this , we can change the face of health care in africa .
and the people who avoid that have 30 percent less infectious disease or something .
you &apos;ll notice that the building is rather austere .
much of this progress comes from a method called &quot; &quot; machine learning . &quot; &quot; machine learning is different than traditional programming , where you give the computer detailed , exact , painstaking instructions .
( laughter ) now i &apos;ve got four or five penguins floating around my head , and i &apos;m just sitting there shooting away .
because each of us contains our entire gene code of where we &apos;ve been for the past billion years , because we &apos;ve evolved from that stuff , you can take that tree of life and collapse it back , and in the measure that you learn to reprogram , maybe we &apos;ll give birth to something that is very close to the first primordial ooze .
first of all , i thought , well , we need a sales team , and we clearly aren &apos;t the a-team here , so let &apos;s — i did all this training .
this caused not only problems , obviously , for the countries themselves , but also for the response .
the difference between arts and sciences is also not constructive versus deconstructive , right ? a lot of people think of the sciences as deconstructive .
she tried to look up her oncologist &apos;s phone number on the internet and she found it , but she found something else too .
in fact , without the optimism bias , we would all be slightly depressed .
( applause ) and this has created the space for my femininity to flourish in a way i had never experienced before .
( laughter ) so , you want to know where life is happening ?
so within less than three months of our team being on the ground , we were already able to push our first products to production .
it turned out that justin was almost certainly not autistic .
they believed in collaboration .
so in fact what we have now is a system where we can use people on the ground , people who are already there , who can both improve and use the existing connectivity , and we &apos;re using old cell phones that are being sent to us by people from around the world that want their phones to be doing something else in their afterlife , so to speak .
there are 13 species in the genus , and they have a particular behavior that i think you will find interesting .
with pivot , you can drill into a decade .
mantra stands for movement and action network for transformation of rural areas .
so on this bit of grassland , we &apos;ll do it , but just in the foreground .
but the point is that it &apos;s going to be a massive readjustment .
we &apos;re a visual species . when scientists first realized that bats were actually using sound to be able to fly and orient and move at night , we didn &apos;t believe it .
to perseverate means to focus obsessively and repeatedly on the exact same thing .
we are fighting against this .
and this is a video that was taken by my surgical mentor , dr. john niparko , who implanted her .
so the pulse enters the bottle , our bullet , with a packet of photons that start traveling through and that start scattering inside .
the audience is too small .
our collective optimism is reflected by the growth of biotechnology across the globe , striving to utilize scientific knowledge to cure human diseases .
i used to want to design a utopian society or a perfect world or something like that .
i don &apos;t know what the hell i &apos;m doing here .
we can make that happen , inexpensively .
but this does not follow any of the usual trends .
it &apos;s an amazing experience every time , no matter where you go .
as long as we can stay dry , that &apos;s a bonus .
and the funny thing is they call me mr. rambo in gaza .
i don &apos;t understand why i was never caught .
so far , the best idea i &apos;ve heard about building grit in kids is something called &quot; &quot; growth mindset . &quot; &quot; this is an idea developed at stanford university by carol dweck , and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed , that it can change with your effort .
and they are showing the signs of this .
what you will get is page after page of white , straight russian couples spray-tanned to the point of mahogany .
but as that space shuttle returns to earth , and as the astronauts enter the earth &apos;s gravitational field , they begin to see the effects of gravity .
now , how does it start ? it starts in schools .
this is a painting i did of my wife in my apartment .
so these guys were absolutely crucial .
he didn &apos;t say &quot; &quot; we have a dream . &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; i have a dream . &quot; &quot; why did he do that ? because most people are not at stage five .
but in many other countries , including my country , the us , there &apos;s actually no law on this , so in theory , you could do it .
is the wheel awesome ? say it with me .
it was accidentally released from the aquarium in monaco , it was bred to be cold tolerant to have in peoples aquaria .
so in wildlife rescue as in life , we learn from each previous experience , and we learn from both our successes and our failures .
also , and this makes me extremely proud , a costa rican woman , christiana figueres , played a decisive role in the negotiations of the paris climate agreement .
so , these are reviews of hundreds of studies by all the big muckety-mucks of the scientific pantheon in the united states , and these are the studies that show needle programs are effective — quite a lot of them .
and so here it is in the stomatopod . and again , this is a situation where engineers are very familiar with this phenomenon , because it destroys boat propellers .
it seems that cancer is a direct result to injury .
by the way , the pronunciation is &quot; &quot; eyjafjallajokull . &quot; &quot; none of your media got it right .
audience member 2 : spade .
&quot; &quot; did you hear about eddie ? he died last week .
their aim is to push the boundary of what can be achieved with autonomous flight .
older people usually are the leaders of traditional societies , and the people most knowledgeable about politics , medicine , religion , songs and dances .
but an amazing alternative energy company in paris is taking us off the grid with solar .
the success rate of the nerve transfers is very high .
i finished my quest , i got the girl .
turns out that there are three factors that you optimize for — and each of these are in complete opposite to what you learn at a business school .
in the early days of this modern markets technology , the financial institutions worked out how they could leverage their buying power , their back office processes , their relationships , their networks to shape these new markets that would create all this new activity .
to develop liquid metal battery , i hired students and post-docs and mentored them .
we &apos;re also , on top of that , integrating wireless networking into an affordable device with gps and gsm .
right now , if you want to test water in the field , you need a trained technician , expensive equipment like this , and you have to wait about a day for chemical reactions to take place and provide results .
so most of my work , i don &apos;t use glue .
and then each of these little spheres is the size of the earth in proportion to the sun .
( applause ) the saying is that with climate , those who know the most are the most worried .
my battery was dead . &quot; &quot; your battery wasn &apos;t dead .
ca : dan , i &apos;d like to hear more on this . so , you &apos;re saying that our response to terror is , i mean , it &apos;s a form of mental bug ?
here it is about 40 minutes later .
i wasn &apos;t raised with wealth or resources or any social standing to speak of .
rng : when our great grandchildren look back at us , will they be as appalled by some of our practices as we are by our slave-owning , heretic-burning , wife-beating , gay-bashing ancestors ?
we learned these things from outsiders .
but then , we &apos;re just a community group , you know .

but if we did this in every single — every fire hydrant we could redefine the emergency .
or in the case of double agents and traitors , like robert hanssen or aldrich ames , lies can betray our country , they can compromise our security , they can undermine democracy , they can cause the deaths of those that defend us .
my daughter katelyn , my 15-year-old , she and i were in the car , and we were driving down the road , and she was sitting there , and she had this idea , and she goes , &quot; &quot; dad , i &apos;ve got this idea . &quot; &quot; and so i listened to her idea and i said , &quot; &quot; katelyn , that &apos;s impossible . &quot; &quot; and she looks at me and she goes , &quot; &quot; dad , after what you just did , how can you call anything impossible ? &quot; &quot; and i laughed , and i said , &quot; &quot; ok , it &apos;s not impossible , it &apos;s just very , very hard . &quot; &quot; and then i paused for a second , and i said , &quot; &quot; katelyn , it may not be impossible , it may not even be very , very hard ,
now i remember that dinner i had with the minister of fisheries 10 years ago when we first brought this up and i got quite animated during the dinner and said , &quot; &quot; well , i think that the conservation community might embrace this idea , minister . &quot; &quot; he paused and put his hands together and said , &quot; &quot; yes , greg , but the devil will be in the details , &quot; &quot; he said .
they &apos;re the only ones that are dangerous .
and the same kind of technology — it &apos;s called dna barcoding , it &apos;s really cool — you can use it to check if your caviar is really beluga , if that sushi is really tuna , or if that goat cheese that you paid so much for is really goat &apos;s .
he would say , &quot; &quot; look , can you believe they have a mango here from mexico ?
let &apos;s start with the definition of schizophrenia .
but we can &apos;t do everything .
the biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you &apos;re designing there &apos;s actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form of the trailer .
beyond that , i didn &apos;t see anyone for 10 weeks .
this is a shot of cannery row in 1932 .
this is just like video conferencing today .
it really started from the destruction of the idea that the government is there because it &apos;s our government , meant to protect the larger public interest .
we have to send the fathers to de-addiction labs and when they come back , most times sober , we have to find a job for them so that they don &apos;t regress .
universes are opened and closed continually .
it only got a 500 , it could have gotten as high up as a 1,000 . &quot; &quot; and this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors into being approved as a car seat .
but of course , there &apos;s another story to this building .
for every nine people who have been executed , we &apos;ve actually identified one innocent person who &apos;s been exonerated and released from death row .
what do we know ? what do people do in these kinds of situations ?
ordinarily you wouldn &apos;t think so , but we &apos;re expecting an e , it &apos;s good enough , and yeah , i &apos;ve seen an e , and then apple says , &quot; yeah , i &apos;ve seen an apple . &quot;
we started using this technique in other problems , and i &apos;m going to tell you about a fascinating problem that we encountered , a case of dystonia .
if you &apos;re sitting in japan , or in new delhi , or in hanoi , your view of the rise of china is a little different than if you &apos;re sitting in beijing .
and so part of my goal is actually to change that and to educate and engage with the public and get you guys talking about this .
a toy gun where you shoot cola and get someone soaking wet ?
is it just literally for control , for hand-stick control ? why am i doing that ?
so for all domestic needs , women have to carry water .
developing the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidly depending on the demands of the situation , that &apos;s what you &apos;ve got to learn to do .
in conclusion , i am a scientist and a dreamer .
the next project i want to show was given to me in an email from a stranger .
not many people . okay .
migrants send money home , but they also save a large amount of money where they live .
that was the speech in which he coined that term .
( laughter ) at the beginning of each class , the professor would call on somebody to present the case .
they &apos;re also silicon .
redwood rainforest is incredibly difficult to move through , and even today , individual trees are being discovered that have never been seen before , including , in the summer of 2006 , hyperion , the world &apos;s tallest tree .
not by the latest combine and tractor invention , but by fertile land ; not by pumps , but by fresh water ; not by chainsaws , but by forests ; and not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the sea .
so what ?
and the audiences of storytellers are often deeply compassionate and empathetic people .
but as these conversations unfolded , i experienced what alice must have when she went down that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world .
if you bite into an organic or conventional papaya that is infected with the virus , you will be chewing on tenfold more viral protein .
as seymour showed back in the 1970s , flies , like songbirds , as you just heard , are capable of learning .
this little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren &apos;t .
and she said , &quot; &quot; well , now that i can walk again , i can go back and complete my studies . &quot; &quot; and to me she represents the next generation of engineers solving problems and ensuring meaningful technologies reach their users .
and in fact , the way that we can communicate today — where alaska is instantly knowing what &apos;s going on in china , and the kiwis did this , and then over in england they tried to ...
and yet , they can find them by tactile discrimination , and they can press it and select it .
and the light that falls onto our eyes is determined by multiple things in the world , not only the color of objects , but also the color of their illumination , and the color of the space between us and those objects .
it &apos;s how they understand access to this culture .
so that suggests to us that our sense of self does not end at the last layer of the epithelium of our bodies , but it ends at the last layer of electrons of the tools that we &apos;re commanding with our brains .
( laughter ) are you an ethical consumer worried about what the drugs industry is doing ?
it gets very expensive to do this research .
how can we make it more successful ?
they reverse-engineer manuals .
how else to describe this , but as a form of mass insanity ?
we made mistakes . we should expect mistakes .
in particular , there &apos;s a medication , valproic acid , which mothers with epilepsy sometimes take , we know can increase that risk of autism .
and everything from the kidney , to the testes , to the back bone , to the fin muscle to — i think that ís pretty much the whole fish — is eaten .
and here is a picture of the khmer rouge .
he &apos;s at about 40 to 50 percent of his previous performance before the lesion .
if we didn &apos;t have this present moment , we wouldn &apos;t have any opportunity to do anything or experience anything , and this moment is a gift .
so , all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them , and i think as designers we need to really think about how we can create a different relationship between our work and the world , whether it &apos;s for business , or , as i &apos;m going to show , on some civic-type projects .
and you can basically see that the richer a country is , the older the people are within it .
we &apos;ll make a new film about this process .
so , 27 years ago i got a traffic ticket that got me thinking .
in a deep , dark canyon off the coast of california , we found the first biofluorescent swellshark , right underneath all the surfers .
what &apos;s the point of that ?
&quot; &quot; bad bear , bad bear ! &quot; &quot; voom !
how can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full dexterity of our hands ?
now when i screamed at my children to stop , sometimes they would both say to me the other person hit them harder .
i have a fairly bad memory , and dishonesty would always get me in trouble , if i , like — so i &apos;ve just sort of been naturally honest and naturally inquisitive , and that sort of leads to that kind of science .
they truly perform as they transform through time and as communities negotiate the spaces and boundaries and resources .
this satellite covers the whole of africa and goes back as far as 1984 , and that &apos;s important , because if you know how many times a place has had a drought in the last 30 years , you can make a pretty good estimate what the chances are of drought in the future , and that means that you can put a price tag on the risk of drought .
we put waste water and some source of co2 into our floating structure , and the waste water provides nutrients for the algae to grow , and they sequester co2 that would otherwise go off into the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas .
and when you find a lone nut doing something great , have the guts to be the first one to stand up and join in .
i call them lessons to change the world .
i love being around these big wind generators .
the science risk was under control .
wait for it .
this is your life . this is ... this is ... this is your life .
or will some of the metallic objects launched from the earth spawn new oases , a post-human life elsewhere ?
they were using parks they weren &apos;t using before .
today , though , i ’ m going to talk about darwin ’ s other strange inversion , which is equally puzzling at first , but in some ways just as important .
nature naturally has allowed carbon dioxide to go up to 280 parts per million .
after energy production , livestock is the second-highest contributor to atmosphere-altering gases .
and the purity of the music makes you hear it very effectively .
these are also , these tar-fueled protocells , are also able to locate resources in their environment .
computers sort of came around through games and toys .
thank you .
but then i found out , it already is .
otto marseus , nice painting , which is &quot; &quot; still life &quot; &quot; at the pitti gallery , and just have an infrared camera peering through , and luckily for art historians , it just was confirmed that there is a signature of otto marseus . it even says when it was made and also the location .
so there is , in china , there is a different kind of mechanism to be responsive to the demands and the thinking of the people .
and so it &apos;s very difficult to get there , if you do it physically .
and so there is this other unique material trait that these materials have , that they &apos;re programmably degradable .
and i invite you all to be part of the conversation .
so , you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually moving away from the light , toward the dark foundations .
now we have to get through the ice .
so they can use the 1984 scenario data mining of the dissident .
if there &apos;s a real rose there , those molecules will be the ones , but even if there &apos;s no rose there , you &apos;ll have the memory of a molecule .
i write fiction sci-fi thrillers , so if i say &quot; &quot; killer robots , &quot; &quot; you &apos;d probably think something like this .
&#91; arabic &#93; and this roughly translates : &quot; &quot; please , let me hold your hand .
we &apos;re working with the guy who invented the seawater greenhouse .
but most importantly , it &apos;ll be a tremendous expansion of human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology , which in some sense we &apos;re doing already .
now imaginative people have been having fun with this for over 400 years .
i use planet earth to go in very extreme environments where conditions were similar to those of mars at the time when the climate changed , and there i &apos;m trying to understand what happened .
it &apos;s pressure from the human population hunting and destroying their habitats which has done so .
but as the social researcher charles murray has documented , as we started to automate the economy , and 1960 is just about when computers started to be used by businesses , as we started to progressively inject technology and automation and digital stuff into the economy , the fortunes of bill and ted diverged a lot .
and it &apos;s been the same in every single room , in every town that we &apos;ve ever told our story .
and so i want to tell you today about baxter , which we &apos;ve been talking about .
first , soon , and then a lot .
this is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand — it &apos;s all about sex tips .
tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels .
we live in an incredibly busy world .
here &apos;s another view of the same .
it &apos;s a 40-year-old company , it understands manufacturing .
so i spent three months in kenya , uganda and tanzania interviewing entrepreneurs that had received 100 dollars to start or grow a business .
how can that not make you feel optimistic for the future ?
this guy up here ?
when people think of holmes , they think of his nemesis being professor moriarty , right , this criminal mastermind .
there &apos;s a number , five to 10 countries in africa that has the same level as sweden and united states .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong .
this is an unnamed species of copepod . a copepod is a crustacean .
we did our best to find reasons to laugh .
too small for detection , it &apos;s your built-in protection .
i learned that success isn &apos;t a one-way street .
now , what good is it to have that ?
for almost five years i stayed there , and we focused on fighting a war that was unconventional and it was difficult and it was bloody and it often claimed its highest price among innocent people .
chris anderson : we had edward snowden here a couple days ago , and this is response time .
i don &apos;t have to be paying attention to what i hear .
so it &apos;s time we make a promise of a world in which we &apos;ve broken the stranglehold that nuclear weapons have on our imaginations ; in which we invest in the creative solutions that come from working backward from the future we desperately want , rather than plodding forward from a present that brings all of the mental models and biases of the past with it .
second question : what causes these changes ?
we &apos;ve watched the financial markets that we uniquely create — these markets that were supposed to be foolproof — we &apos;ve watched them kind of collapse before our eyes .
at the same time , a civil war was taking place in el salvador , and again , the civilian population was caught up in the conflict .
so let &apos;s send into this graph a bunch of tiny , digital marbles and let them go randomly through the graph .
there were 93 of us , and we were all below deck .
so we see some green shoots that things are getting better .
so honeybees are important for their role in the economy as well as in agriculture .
and when he saw i was painting in arabic , he got so mad — actually , hysterical — and he asked for the wall to be erased .
the striking thing about it is that only face recognition is impaired ; everything else is just fine .
so , it &apos;s not a palm pilot by any stretch of the imagination , but it has a thumb-scroll so you can do everything with one hand .
we wish we &apos;d gotten more of it .
and finally , she has a dermatitis on the fingers of her right hand , a dermatitis that is unique to the linoleum factory workers in burntisland . &quot; &quot; and when bell actually strips the patient , begins to examine the patient , you can only imagine how much more he would discern .
a momentous thing that can happen to a culture is they can acquire a new style of arguing : trial by jury , voting , peer review , now this . right ?
its closest relative is , in fact , from mice , and so we would call this a xenotropic retrovirus , because it &apos;s infecting a species other than mice .
and in the life that everyone sees , who i am is a friend , a son , a brother , a stand-up comedian and a teenager .
for what it &apos;s worth , we went to sagres , which was considered , at the time , to be the end of the world .
they &apos;re molecules that protect other molecules as they move through a cell .
it started on a given day , and then the students would watch videos on a weekly basis and do homework assignments .
these are community affairs , by the way .
look , i can prove this to you : here &apos;s a little lottery .
so they copy each other .
this worked .
i &apos;m not talking about the kind of technology that has enveloped our lives , and that people come to ted to hear about .
that &apos;s the only way they are effective .
( applause ) i have a cd here . i &apos;m sorry that i didn &apos;t say anything on time .
and for dollars , is their 30 million , plus the 20 million dollars from the american manufacturer .
you don &apos;t have to dig deep down underground .
now we have taken on a second thing , and this gets to my wish .
it is february and not lying is impossible . &quot; &quot; and i really spend a lot of time wondering , how much truth do we tell ?
( laughter ) but that &apos;s the work i &apos;m doing with biosentient corporation trying to figure out how do we integrate these things ?
there &apos;s no dynamic , there &apos;s no highs or lows , if everything is awesome .
this is just the grassroots stuff again , ok ?
this is a pretty involved process ; it took us about four and a half years .
and all of you need to have it embedded in your brains and to organize yourselves around it .
he took owl monkeys , wired them up so that a computer watched their brains while they moved , especially looking at the movement of their right arm .
his current obsession is to leave lebanon at any cost — even if it meant embarking on a hazardous journey along with refugees drifting towards europe today through the mediterranean .
i am a nomadic artist .
rather than just cutting costs , you need to think about initiatives that will enable you to win in the medium term , initiatives to drive growth , actions that will fundamentally change the way the company operates , and very importantly , investments to develop the leadership and the talent .
it &apos;s now two years that you &apos;ve been running ?
( video ) computer : a cat lying on a bed in a blanket .
it matters for now . it matters as soon as possible .
it is in our dna to be curious .
we decorated every bulletin board in that building with bright , colorful , and positive messages .
but as humans with hearts , we can all rejoice in the unity of life , and perhaps we can change what once happened in that sacred cave .
they touched me when i was four and i lost my eyesight and was partially paralyzed .
we &apos;re looking at building on some of the most precious resources of africa : people .
and i &apos;ve never really felt very motivated by pecking orders or by superchickens or by superstars .
and it &apos;s found in cotton fields , and coltan mines , and even car washes in norway and england .
and do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error and not machine error , and can therefore be prevented by machines ?
but this man doesn &apos;t need to go there .
look at the solar system , and look at the earth .
( applause ) our friends in law enforcement have much to do , because we &apos;ve seen that online violence is an extension of in-person violence .
today there are approximately 6.8 billion people in the world , and within our lifetime , that number &apos;s going to grow to about nine billion .
and so sometimes these analogous experiences , analogous role-play , can also be quite valuable .
just in the past couple years , we &apos;ve seen digital tools display skills and abilities that they never , ever had before , and that kind of eat deeply into what we human beings do for a living .
and language can &apos;t be understood in its abstraction .
this is one of those alternatives .
and there &apos;s things that no one &apos;s voice can do .
and that &apos;s not a good experience , to leave a gallery like that .
it was something i read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in iraq . and she said , &quot; save a man from drowning , you are responsible to him for life . &quot;
i told you last year , i &apos;ll tell you again , my mother was born in egypt , and i — who am i ?
&quot; &quot; you want me to deliver human rights throughout my global supply chain .
but you might not realize that our ability to look into the body in this simple way , using our senses , is quite recent .
and i resemble that remark .
these models are around a million lines of code at this point , and growing by tens of thousands of lines of code every year .
you show all these interconnections , all these interrelations .
( &quot; &quot; what &apos;s a jurassic park ? &quot; &quot; ) now , what is the story here ?
i do not want to have my opinions challenged .
in essence , could we &quot; &quot; app &quot; &quot; chemistry ?
so i traveled there last year , and part of the joy i had in going there was going to these caves .
ak : it &apos;s a great question , or , said better , this is a question we &apos;ve been receiving in the media for possibly the last year .
when in &apos; 96 i was sent by the united nations high commissioner for refugees to the north caucasus , i knew some of the risks .
so amazon went for six years without returning any profit to investors , and people had patience .
it was instrumental in stopping commercial whaling , and was built on the idea that if we couldn &apos;t save whales , what could we save ?
for example , ship captains needed to know information about the tides in order to safely dock at ports .
and so they gave me this name : kè , which means to overcome or to conquer , and wén , and that &apos;s the character for literature or the arts .
they gave her just a couple of months to live .
the matching idea has been successfully used to match , for instance , students with university places , to match kidney donors with patients , and it underlies the kind of algorithms that exist on dating websites .
he started , as i mentioned , to get in the room with evil , to not denounce , and became almost obsequious when he won the nickname serbio , for instance , and even when he negotiated with the khmer rouge would black-box what had occurred prior to entering the room .
this is a child , and what you &apos;re seeing here is real data , and on the far right-hand side , where everything starts getting a little bit catastrophic , that is the patient going into cardiac arrest .
we finance anything that a media company would need , from printing presses to transmitters .
there &apos;s also a great deal , i think , of religious illiteracy around .
there &apos;s lust , which is just wanting to have sex .
na : well the yemen times , across 20 years , has been through so much .
we don &apos;t work from offices .
so from sixth through 12th grade , once , twice , sometimes three times a week , i would take classes at the art museum , and i was surrounded by other kids who loved to draw , other kids who shared a similar passion .
fg : no . not now either .
in addition to the supply levers that we can push — and remember , we need large amounts , because at the moment , we get 90 percent of our energy from fossil fuels — in addition to those levers , we could talk about other ways of solving this issue .
even now , man may be unwittingly changing the world &apos;s climate through the waste products of his civilization .
but we do have the first three minutes .
they dumped us there .
i &apos;m not really sure what &apos;s on the other side of this hill .
i want to start with a story , a la seth godin , from when i was 12 years old .
this animation from my friends at proton studios shows looking at the big bang from the outside .
we take their supply chain , we take all the factory names , we do a random sample , we send inspectors on an unannounced basis to inspect those facilities , and then we publish the results .
( laughter ) we writers , we kind of do have that reputation , and not just writers , but creative people across all genres , it seems , have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable .
it &apos;s because i &apos;m seeing an equation and they &apos;re dealing with exponents and that 30 percent that i didn &apos;t know is showing up .
but this is it .
i mean , i could tell you hundreds of them .
so , and you get all the disease-protective substances .
does that mean we &apos;ve doubled the number of pieces of information we need to know , from 120 to 240 ?
but we can &apos;t have a system that closes that data off , because it is too rich of a source of inspiration , innovation and discovery for new things in medicine .
next i worked with the japanese agency , aq , on a research project into mental health .
you can step on the scale .
so bageye is bald and has baggy eyes .
susan parks of penn state has actually studied this .
but there &apos;s a unity of some sort that &apos;s starting to emerge .
the results of this kind of work are simple and they &apos;re powerful .
it &apos;s so amazing , it &apos;s so exciting .
and they grow and grow by stages . and they climb out of the water , burst out , as the adult which we see .
and so they did something that &apos;s really radical , when you think about how government is used to working .
governments get elected , and then they fall below 50 percent approval in a few months and stay there and get worse until the next election .
so our children are getting larger , but at the same time we are growing into different directions .
( laughter ) it &apos;s in all seven continents , including antarctica .
in britain , it could mean looking to the french , learning from the french , getting directly elected mayors in place in a french commune system .
metal peppered his face .
but what i &apos;d like to talk about today is the fact that this morning , about a billion people on earth — or one out of every seven — woke up and didn &apos;t even know how to fill this cup .
one billion grains of sand come into existence in the world each second .
so as an academic , we &apos;re always trained to be able to jump through hoops to raise funding for our labs , and we get our robots to do that .
we &apos;ve seen what happens when we divide an already small planet into smaller islands .
i think that torajans socially recognize and culturally express what many of us feel to be true despite the widespread acceptance of the biomedical definition of death , and that is that our relationships with other humans , their impact on our social reality , doesn &apos;t cease with the termination of the physical processes of the body , that there &apos;s a period of transition as the relationship between the living and the dead is transformed but not ended .
in this talk today , i want to present a different idea for why investing in early childhood education makes sense as a public investment .
there &apos;s a lot of information here .
so i started doubting myself and wondering what was the real purpose of this whole project ?
it was in far western new south wales .
and we don &apos;t even know the shape of the language .
it should be thought of as a biological moonshot with a timetable .
( laughter ) of course it &apos;s meant to be funny , but in all seriousness , suicidal ideation is quite common with traumatic brain injuries .
so , this it isn &apos;t something that is still undergoing lab tests .
i forgot my discretion .
the musicians hate them .
the warriors won the game and went on to win the championship .
but densification is not going to work everywhere .
now , i think one of the reasons — i &apos;ll try to convince you today — is that we have a fundamental misconception about the power of time .
how are you trying to uplift nutrition and survival and literacy so these countries can take care of themselves , and say wow , this is going well , and be smarter .
so suppose your goal is to get kids into school .
so we can now , in a matter of hours , determine a whole human genome .
but frankly there are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from nyu , have them go study for a semester at the university of arkansas , and vice versa . do it at the high school level .
why ? why do we have to be left out ?
that &apos;s what your genes are doing every day .
you can imagine what it was like in the winter at 10,000 feet .
i can &apos;t think of a single general principle of biology that does not have an exception somewhere by some organism .
it &apos;s a beautiful day .
we talked to 600 drug addicts in three cities in indonesia , and we said , &quot; &quot; well , do you know how you get hiv ? &quot; &quot; &quot; oh yeah , by sharing needles . &quot;
well , it &apos;s been 18 years now since verdana and georgia were released .
it &apos;s just part of your neighborly duty .
and so , you know , 390 percent approval rating ain &apos;t so bad .
sometimes it shows you what you shouldn &apos;t do .
and this is the wire opera theater . we did it in two months .
i don &apos;t know how many of you might imagine it , but there &apos;s actually a tedster who recently got back from iraq .
this has changed .
in 2002 , a group of treatment activists met to discuss the early development of the airplane .
so that is a non-zero-sum dynamic .
notice how few barriers there are to movement across all of the oceans compared to land .
that was the last month for the year of the horse .
it &apos;s a wonderful day in our country &apos;s history ; it &apos;s a wonderful day in the globe &apos;s history to be able to have an actual sitting president say , enough of this — first to himself , and then to the rest of the world .
i mean , it &apos;s the same story . it &apos;s just different names .
in my experience , in fact , the light footprint was extremely helpful .
now , in a word , the answer is &quot; &quot; rules . &quot; &quot; bad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that &apos;s available when people can bring new technologies in and make them available to someone like nelson .
animals are not just raw materials .
all right .
and the hell creek project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find , and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them .
so today what you have is what i call the middle 40 percent , the people who are not in the top 10 and who are not in the bottom 50 , and what you can view as the wealth middle class that owns 20 to 30 percent of total wealth , national wealth , whereas they used to be poor , a century ago , when there was basically no wealth middle class .
if you look at the scene , egypt , for 30 years , had been in a downhill — going into a downhill .
and let me give you a few illustrations .
and so i can generate a force feedback .
and there &apos;s five or six different compilations there , but each one of those compilations reflects input from hundreds of these kinds of records from corals .
but i do think it &apos;s an important conversation .
so it blinks one second after you do .
if you look up high enough , you could see me .
( laughter ) which isn &apos;t a great idea .
and this brings us to our third part of the exercise , which is to draw how to make toast , but this time in a group .
in fact , in go , there are more possible moves than there are atoms in the universe .
we &apos;ve shared transportation .
and then 10 years from now , billions will again have gone into africa , and we would still have the same problems .
and we might be able to find evidence of our own origin in the most unlikely place , and this place in mars .
instead of thinking about what to build , building in order to think .
so i hope there aren &apos;t too many psychologists in this audience .
but online , everybody speaks at the same speed .
we surround ourselves with people who feel the same way we do , and we approve each other , and that &apos;s a really good feeling .
number two : free trade .
we also studied vineet nayar at hcl technologies , an indian outsourcing company .
but sometimes we are only five doctors and 16 nurses , and we are physically getting exhausted to see all of them .
we knew they worked through old-fashioned trial and error .
and so most of you aren &apos;t tackling oppressive regimes on the weekends , so i wanted to think of a few examples that might be a little bit more relatable .
( applause ) thank you .
and having the goal in mind , thinking about where it might lead , directed me to a life of looking at all of the small details to allow this to become possible , to be able to launch and go help build a space station where you are on board a million-pound creation that &apos;s going around the world at five miles a second , eight kilometers a second , around the world 16 times a day , with experiments on board that are teaching us what the substance of the universe is made of and running 200 experiments inside .
so the first unproven claim is that you can use brain scans to read people &apos;s thoughts and emotions .
he &apos;s become the head of art center , and there &apos;s a building by craig ellwood there .
and when you have a hum like that , you can &apos;t help but strive for greatness .
and we as humans are social creatures and must , or are aided by , or enjoy more , the consumption of information in the presence of others .
and although today is about innovation without borders , i have to say that in my life , innovation has only been possible because of my borders .
and his mother told me this story of coming home one day — and he went to college nearby — and she said , &quot; &quot; i saw that car , which you can always recognize , in the parking lot of a bar , &quot; &quot; she said . ( laughter ) &quot; &quot; and i thought to myself , they &apos;re six feet tall , he &apos;s three feet tall .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future normally as experiences .
and we &apos;re in the process of sequencing all that at the present time .
you see , anything that uses a lot of energy is going to produce heat , and we don &apos;t observe this .
here are two very different walls , very different geometric pictures .
we make it really , really simple for me as well as anyone else who wants to use the site .
what if there were a pure form of justice ?
three : i failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude , not a lifestyle .
i &apos;m not suggesting that obesity is benign , but what i am suggesting is it may be the lesser of two metabolic evils .
it is growing all around us .
and so it &apos;s going to try to watch your response .
and bp was hardly our first experience of this in recent years .
they &apos;re killed ; we don &apos;t even hear about them .
and you &apos;ll be left in peace to talk to the person you really want to talk to .
here we are on october the 19th .
and once again , it &apos;s this invitation that asks people to lay down on the glacier and give it a hug .
done well , of course .
in the &apos; 60s already , through the green revolution and the haber-bosch process of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere — you know , human &apos;s today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole .
and here are two different images of the archimedes manuscript .
now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that gallup survey .
so i want to show you a clip of the film now .
the secret is , they have an eco-tourism program , which is absolutely brilliant .
and i understood that his surprise was my protection .
what i &apos;m not suggesting is that microbial cellulose is going to be a replacement for cotton , leather or other textile materials .
the world trade organization : treaty-based organization , entirely treaty-based , and yet , powerful enough to hold even the most powerful , the united states , to account if necessary .
so here you can see the left camera , the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the airpix .
and he took the thing and he looked up to steve and he said , &quot; look , hydrophobic string . &quot;
and for the future it won &apos;t serve us .
people consciously follow things even though , why , we don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t want to say in any way that it only has to do with what we do , but what i do know is that our work and the work that we do may have helped a lot of them start thinking about demobilization , and it may have helped a lot of them take the final decision .
we also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road .
i am an emotional , i am an emotional , incondotional , devotional creature .
but even more , i had a brother die in a tragic accident at 15 , and something as simple as this means we won &apos;t be together as a family .
this is just a fact of human nature that has been recognized in social science and in literature and in religion and in virtually every field of discipline .
if you don &apos;t like the 24 / 7 all kardashian all the time programming , you &apos;ve got to stop clicking on the stories about kim kardashian &apos;s sideboob .
so i said , &quot; &quot; i am dead , so i need to be born again . &quot; &quot; so , i wanted to be a painter like him , except , i don &apos;t know how to paint .
all right ?
but this is a problem of just incentives , just incentives .
the scientists i was with were not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff — the birds , the turtles , the dolphins , the glamorous stuff .
first one is really a question of origins .
this is the environmental conditions on the planet .
i &apos;m a visual artist , and i &apos;m also one of the co-founders of the plastic pollution coalition .
so when you see this march on washington in 1963 , when you look at that picture , where this is the march where martin luther king gave his famous &quot; &quot; i have a dream &quot; &quot; speech , 1963 , you don &apos;t just see a march and you don &apos;t just hear a powerful speech , you also see the painstaking , long-term work that can put on that march .
( laughter ) it &apos;s a pair of earmuffs and a set of safety goggles that have been masked over except for two small pinholes , because distraction is the competitive memorizer &apos;s greatest enemy .
( laughter ) let me take you back to the early 1960s .
malaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year .
and husbands can drag their wives across , if their wives don &apos;t feel ready .
and big companies like intel or smaller design firms like ideo or startups like bump , were inviting me to give workshops , just to practice this idea of smashing electronics and everyday objects together .
have you been to southern spain lately ? there are roads everywhere .
the first is the policy challenge of designing and implementing alternatives to ineffective prohibitionist policies , even as we need to get better at regulating and living with the drugs that are now legal .
when the environmentalists speak with economists , it &apos;s like a schizophrenic dialogue , completely incoherent .
and the last story i &apos;m going to talk about is quite a story .
mastery : the desire to get better and better at something that matters .
and the thing is , though , if you looked at my brain during those years in the moonies — neuroscience is expanding exponentially , as ray kurzweil said yesterday . science is expanding .
i also translate weather data into musical scores .
and you saw ty &apos;s little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the convolution program right before your eyes .
you &apos;ll all agree with me , i &apos;m sure .
design really looks upon the whole world and it considers the world in all of its different ranges .
heparin — a blood thinner , a pharmaceutical product — starts out in artisanal workshops like this in china , because the active ingredient comes from pigs &apos; intestines .
and this was true for all the pair-wise combinations of tasks .
so there &apos;s a list there of the different countries that have it , and then there &apos;s a few more coming on board .
and that &apos;s hard to do if you don &apos;t know who you are .
now , in regard to the current economic crisis , we think that we will just wake up again and everything will be the same as before , and no political or social changes are needed .
but we made it to pennsylvania .
but today i want to go a little bit deeper , and think about what the nature of this is .
after all , there are many other countries who face the same issues that we face .
we have to trust a lot of procedures .
thank you very much for your time .
are we still capable of that as a country ?
but for the first time in history , we have the technology ; we have the know-how ; we have the cash ; we have the life-saving drugs .
and lebanon ? struggling , of course , but it &apos;s managing .
and he &apos;s sitting there in front of the haptic device , the force feedback system , and he &apos;s moving his pen towards the heart , and the heart is now beating in front of him , so he can see how the heart is beating .
start from what they know . build on what they have . &quot; &quot; this was kind of the defining slogan .
so we &apos;ve created formulations for all around the world using regional byproducts .
now , our big symbol at ideo is actually not so much the place , it ’ s a thing .
and so it &apos;s quite surprising that many of us let our unconscious influence those decisions in ways that we are not quite aware of .
and therefore we know that women are not getting the full benefit of modern science and medicine today .
and she was also famous for walking up to a 15-foot rope , climbing it using only her arms , and then shuffling away and apologizing , because she knew she was supposed to use both her arms and her legs , as the rangers had trained them .
but when sarah jones asked me to please come to ted , i said , well , you know , first , i don &apos;t know that , you know — before two years ago , you would not find me in front of an audience of people , much less like this because i did not like to give speeches because i feel that , as an immigrant , i do not have good english skills for speaking .
now , i know some of you all are probably thinking , how did you find a great mentor in prison ?
and so , in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks , rather than somehow sensing the day outside .
keep learning .
( laughter ) we are right now seeing a much larger scale of tracking of individual citizens than he could have ever imagined .
you just know what it feels like to live in a closet .
that &apos;s true no matter what thing you &apos;re talking about .
they have it running through mazes , controlling where it &apos;s going .
once we define somebody as an enemy , we have trouble putting ourselves in their shoes , just naturally .
here &apos;s a map a lawyer made . he put on it the water plant , and which houses are there , which houses have been connected to the water .
let &apos;s start with iraq .
if we allowed refugees to do that , it would have major advantages .
he was born there in 1924 .
by 2030 , if the maize , or corn , varieties , which is the dominant crop — 50 percent of the nutrition in southern africa are still in the field — in 2030 , we &apos;ll have a 30 percent decrease in production of maize because of the climate change already in 2030 .
and so i &apos;m writing a new book .
but of course , you know , the reason you &apos;re laughing is bad for humans too .
we &apos;ve worked with a bunch of universities on a project looking at interactive newsprint .
we will install panels on your roof .
we &apos;ve driven from san francisco to los angeles on highway 1 .
you feel naked , exposed and vulnerable , but that vulnerability , that humility , it can be an extraordinary benefit to the practice of medicine .
let &apos;s multiply this sound by four-thirds . ( beep ) what happens ?
and the red line is the treatment as usual — medication with a medical doctor .
and we now have 350-pound auto workers learning bird songs on the internet .
you have half of an idea , somebody else has the other half , and if you &apos;re in the right environment , they turn into something larger than the sum of their parts .
this was something we did with ibm that &apos;s a little bit more than a year old .
what it means is , when she sat in a restaurant in years to come , 10 years to come , 15 years to come , or she &apos;s on the beach , every so often she &apos;s going to start rubbing her skin , and out of there will come a piece of that shrapnel .
and this acoustical nuisance and visual nuisance basically exposed the discomfort of the work to this encompassing nature of the retrospective .
currently , the new narrative about braddock , a poster child for rust belt revitalization , is a story of urban pioneers discovering a new frontier .
so take a simple example , with r equals five percent and g equals one percent , wealth holders only need to reinvest one fifth of their capital income to ensure that their wealth rises as fast as the size of the economy .
but outside of that , i didn &apos;t really realize why it mattered that my parents were from two different places .
and since that time , this has been replicated 20 times .
obviously this is not a mandated duty , but for the gifted filmmaker and the responsible journalist or even blogger , it strikes me as being utterly inescapable .
and i &apos;ve always believed that the act of architecture , even a private house , when somebody else will see it , is a political act , because it will be visible to others .
the countries on the left have a form at the dmv that looks something like this .
because if we do , i can look forward to the conversation i &apos;m going to have with my daughter in 20 years .
and all of these things combine to create an enormous amount of torque on the planet .
we know that little skippy is loading his uzi down here , getting ready for homeroom . ( laughter ) we know that heather , his sister heather , 14 years old , is turning tricks up here to support her drug habit .
it doesn &apos;t look like much — in fact , it isn &apos;t like much .
and we said , &quot; &quot; well , there &apos;s another option .
and that changed , first with ships when we had the renaissance , the scientific revolution and also the industrial revolution .
when we have enough of them , we &apos;re going to have a nation that &apos;s not worth defending .
when your children and grandchildren sort of pose questions to you about this period of time , one of the things they &apos;re gonna ask you , is how it was they we allowed some of our closest living relatives , some of the most valuable and endangered species on our planet , to go extinct because we weren &apos;t able to address some of the issues of poverty in these parts of the world .
it &apos;ll be built into architecture .
and i &apos;m happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist .
but i also know that if you really understand me now , then your brain ... and your brain ... and your brain are really similar to mine .
what do any parent do ?
to do this , we &apos;ve had to make recordings of people laughing , and we &apos;ve had to do whatever it takes to make people laugh , and we got those same people to produce more posed , social laughter .
my father worked as a policeman in the city .
so in the end , he patted me on the shoulder like a swim coach might .
i was born in a scots presbyterian ghetto in canada , and dropped out of high school . i don &apos;t own a cell phone , and i paint on paper using gouache , which hasn &apos;t changed in 600 years .
i have a hard time envisioning a future in which someone is saying , &quot; &quot; where , oh where , can i find a picture of a cute cat ? &quot; &quot; ushahidi , by contrast , is civic value .
part of that is true , there aren &apos;t as many prominent women in technology .
it doesn &apos;t catch every little thing that &apos;s going on .
this is a huge space that contains all words in such a way that the distance between any two of them is indicative of how closely related they are .
but according to a committee of academics convened by the national academy of sciences last year , the relationship between our historically high incarceration rates and our low crime rate is pretty shaky .
and then , once we start making those kinds of connections and asking those important and big questions , then we can talk about how we can be transformative , in other words , how can we do something differently ?
and no matter what country you live or work in , you &apos;ve also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of , even in their most ordinariness .
and it occurred to me that in this whole non-governmental world , somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets .
they actually see landscapes and human beings and gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that .
so what happened when the professor left the room ?
the yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars , creating carbon dioxide and alcohol — essentially it &apos;s burping and sweating , which is what bread is .
could i be misinterpreting the nature of my perceptions ?
and there was an unexpected speaker who wasn &apos;t on the program , and he talked about dna .
and we didn &apos;t study any of these animals .
in a 2015 survey of 70,000 employees , two-thirds of everyone who is paid at the market rate said that they felt they were underpaid .
so for instance , a biotechnology company has now found broadly neutralizing antibodies to influenza , as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus .
little , ring , middle , index . and then open .
fourth , feedback .
i don &apos;t want opinions ; i want knowledge .
these copepods are a major constituent of the oceans , and they are a major part of the diet of grazing baleen whales .
and what is significant about the program is that we learned a number of things .
tedtalks can &apos;t be a one-way process , one-to-many .
so in looking at that , i also realized that i was really angry .
it &apos;s a very simple behavior that shows you the power of this approach .
you add other forms of innovation and processor design , you get a doubling of price performance of computing every one year .
we don &apos;t know what causes them .
the question i would ask is , &quot; &quot; what &apos;s worth solving ? &quot; &quot; if you haven &apos;t seen this , it &apos;s pretty amazing .
to try this , i went to a mario batali restaurant in manhattan — del posto .
this is near the top of the icefall .
and guess what — they solved the problem .
and i believed i could do it .
and i was permanently hooked .
but out there , those lowest of the lows are so often contrasted with the highest of the highs .
it guides us how to feel .
i really got close to design again .
india has the right institutional conditions for economic growth , whereas china is still struggling with political reforms .
it &apos;s clearly undisturbed by us .
because think about the teddy bear .
i was as reckless and foolish as only young men can be .
punta espinosa is where i lived for over a year , and we call it uninhabited because there are no people there .
dancers at a street corner — it &apos;s a crowd , a small one , but they can all obviously see what each other can do .
and i said , &quot; &quot; what &apos;s the matter ? &quot; &quot; and she said , &quot; &quot; why can &apos;t i save e.t. ? why can &apos;t i come ? &quot; &quot; and then all of a sudden i realized : they weren &apos;t children ; they were boys — all boys .
and when you think about it , this makes a lot of sense , that using specialized physical objects would help people use an interface more easily .
( laughter ) eh : and the sitcom jewish mother is born , right there .
by now , you might have sort of lost perspective on how large this cube of brain tissue actually is .
case in point : i came up here and — ( clicking ) — they wouldn &apos;t tell me where the lectern was .
look , it &apos;s been a rough election year , a reminder that people with my immigration history could be removed at the whim of a leader .
i &apos;m an archeological geneticist at the center for evolutionary medicine at the university of zurich , and i study the origins and evolution of human health and disease by conducting genetic research on the skeletal and mummified remains of ancient humans .
the choices don &apos;t make sense , because it &apos;s the wrong question .
and there was no argument , because it &apos;s incentive .
just wait over there .
and everybody &apos;s dogs at home have an autobiographical self to a certain degree .
we introduced our first microcredit program in 1975 , and the women who organized it said , &quot; &quot; we only want to lend to women who practice family planning .
and this is how they see the world .
sometimes a single threat can polarize us , as we saw .
i think that can be changed by building combinatorial vaccines in advance .
that &apos;s my camera lens . the first one — the one i shot my bob dylan film with 35 years ago .
and we &apos;d do that by building fences , using motorbikes and horses , and the sheep would make their way all the way back to the shearing shed for the different seasons .
she lives in a little worker &apos;s camp right next to the road , and she wanted a different lot on things .
( laughter ) so , that &apos;s going to look pretty shabby now .
that &apos;s a huge number , and what does that mean ?
it tells you if you have h5n1 .
and i &apos;m going to talk about experiments that involve actually using this brain science , first of all to understand how it contributes to the loss of function as we age .
our heritage is much more than our collective memory — it &apos;s our collective treasure .
my american colleagues have told me i &apos;ve got to call it a router , so that everyone here understands — ( laughter ) — but nonetheless , here is the device .
i was the guy beaten up bloody every week in the boys &apos; room , until one teacher saved my life .
now , if we can learn those values from at least some influences on the right , if we can take them and incorporate them , maybe we could do a little trade .
there &apos;s an obvious objection .
we have several teams in the main part of afghanistan .
clearly , there are wrongs that need to be righted .
i left , and i became a social entrepreneur , and i set up an organization with mark shand called elephant family , which deals with asian elephant conservation .
now , our foundation , for the last nine years , has invested in this .
a message to the entertainment industry and to the press : on the whole , you &apos;ve done a wonderful job fighting stigma and prejudice of many kinds .
beliefs could be : where are my arms in space ?
boyd varty : well thanks , pat .
it was too late for me , but maybe i could help someone else , someone who could use the information .
but it turns out this is just a reminder that , although this is a lot of fun , when you interpret these graphs , you have to be very careful , and you have to adopt the base standards in the sciences .
they are happy . they don &apos;t have problems .
so it turns out that propulsion isn &apos;t really the problem .
( arabic ) omer by brother , i will always love you .
no way , that &apos;s impossible ! no no no no no ! that &apos;s not possible . &quot; &quot; till finally one prince said , &quot; princess , i accept , you have defeated me . &quot;
i wish they would just go away .
the first relates to the idea of civic education .
and if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing , your hands are bleeding in no time .
here &apos;s the girlfriend .
that compassion is actually an inherent human quality .
it &apos;s been estimated that two thirds of the melodies dylan used in his early songs were borrowed .
they have no trouble telling us what art is about .
in this century , scientists may learn to awaken the power of artificial intelligence .
when you ask that question , you think people must be happier in california if , say , you live in ohio .
and we must rebuild these forests .
but we can also store energy using superconductors , because we have no dissipation .
so , i propose the following — of course , the astronomer wouldn &apos;t like the idea — but let &apos;s turn the hubble telescope upside down .
and of course , in italy where — i mean , italians always seem to know where to find their pleasure — they &apos;ve launched an official slow sex movement .
these changes and others like them changed the way that portlanders live , and their vehicle-miles traveled per day , the amount that each person drives , actually peaked in 1996 , has been dropping ever since , and they now drive 20 percent less than the rest of the country .
this is actually from the klondike gold rush . this is the white pass trail .
so , steven is sharing this story , but he is not alone .
and it &apos;s a really poor area .
we then grow the cells outside the body , take the scaffold , coat the scaffold with the cells — the patient &apos;s own cells , two different cell types .
i learned this firsthand with my next adventure .
and none of those problems could i have dealt with , but i have a really bright research team .
today , we &apos;ve got great technology : we have gps .
&quot; &quot; my grandfather worked at this factory .
and that &apos;s the reason i beat him , actually , because i respected him .
you can have a succession of changes .
in this example , although the mammogram found one tumor , we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors — one is small as three millimeters .
it &apos;s not really what we do , is it , when we &apos;re at our best ?
sandy was a reminder of how such an illusion can shatter .
if you chase a girl , the girl won &apos;t like you .
one day she said to me , &quot; &quot; my wish is to finish college and be able to support my children . &quot; &quot; she &apos;s at a place where she can &apos;t find money to go to school .
i just sat there and listened .
perhaps god is testing us : testing our charity , or our faith .
and this is all within our reach pretty easily .
they also get entangled in fishing gear .
did you know that paris has more mathematicians than any other city in the world ?
kb : thank you so much . ca : thank you , khalida . ( applause )
i want you to think about them as architectural objects , so what they are , are just pure lines .
we were fortunate , because in a way our building was future-proofed .
that was , of course , by le corbusier , the famous architect .
and another thing i would say is that girls &apos; voices and women &apos;s voices are beautiful , they are there , but we cannot do this alone .
we pioneered all sorts of new , flexible work methods : job shares , profit-sharing , and eventually , co-ownership when i took a quarter of the company into the hands of the staff at no cost to anyone but me .
he said , &quot; &quot; go on , milo . squash it . &quot; &quot; what we &apos;re using there is , we &apos;re using something , a piece of technology called tellme .
and was it even worthwhile to donate ?
we replaced these cars with trees , using which now we can make multi-layered forests .
but they do send a message to boys , that they are not , the boys are not really the target audience .
if i have a gps and a camera in my car , i have a pretty precise idea of where i am and how fast i &apos;m going .
my preconception of bilbao was this wonderful building , you go inside and there &apos;d be extraordinary spaces .
when they swarm and chase you down the block to shoot you , a little bit less so .
and so , up to 30 percent of our land and our space is used storing these hunks of steel .
it grows every year .
at night , i &apos;m in a submarine , i have force-feedback gloves , and i could delicately set up a lab in the front of my submarine , where the squishy robot fingers are delicately collecting and putting things in jars , and we can conduct our research .
so the word &quot; &quot; silhouette &quot; &quot; comes from a minister of finance , etienne de silhouette .
you rotate around the center of the circle , the circle remains unchanged .
nobody would have said 50 years ago that apartheid would have gone in 1990 , or that the berlin wall would have fallen at the turn of the &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s , or that polio could be eradicated , or perhaps 60 years ago , nobody would have said a man could gone to the moon .
instead , we believe you need to be inspired by biology .
i need to be in class because i need to graduate . &quot; &quot; so he knew that i was not going to let him be a victim of his circumstance , but we were going to push forward and keep moving on .
that gives you an idea of where they have people .
the next morning , two officers came to my home and reported that mike &apos;s car was down at the bridge .
it told us we were using twice as much energy as our neighbors . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) &quot; &quot; and for the last two weeks , all we can think about , talk about , and even argue about , is what we should be doing to save energy .
on a thursday morning in july 2005 , the bomber and i , unknowingly , boarded the same train carriage at the same time , standing , apparently , just feet apart .
put simply , in a room full of randomly selected people , i &apos;m a maths genius .
and so , we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all beings .
i was listed on the online biography that said i was a design missionary .
this is a map of stockholm , my hometown .
and from that comes the internet .
( laughter ) lp : i &apos;d just like to end off by just saying this : it took me four months again to feel my hands .
( laughter ) and yogi berra used to say , of course , that it &apos;s very tough to make predictions , especially about the future . ( laughter )
we all very matter of factly bought a pair of pants , put them on and said , &quot; &quot; thank you . that &apos;s exactly what i needed today , &quot; &quot; and then exited without revealing what had happened and went in all different directions .
similarly , infrastructure — for a long time , infrastructure was not a priority .
but you have to remember that these trees are literally bigger than whales , and what that means is that they &apos;re impossible to understand just by walking on the ground below them .
i know this , that &apos;s why love can be defined in a more accurate way as the desire of being desired .
we spotlighted many famous people such as lionel messi , the most famous soccer player in the world .
( laughter ) they were memorizing hundreds of random numbers , looking at them just once .
and it &apos;s known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus , they maybe lose the ability to recognize faces .
it &apos;s in six languages , and you can tell your own story about what happened to you on that day .
ok , that &apos;s practically everybody .
design done . ( laughter ) and they went for it ! ( laughter ) author liked it , publisher liked it , and that is how the book went out into the world , and it was really fun to see people reading this on the subway and walking around with it and what have you , and they all sort of looked like they were crazy . ( laughter )
we have no idea of what the supply chain is for those clinics .
and then i had a 15-hour surgery in which my surgeon , dr. john healey at memorial sloan-kettering hospital in new york , took out my left femur and replaced it with titanium .
so while this is a very small story , we hope that it represents a step in the right direction for the future of rural communities and for the future of public education and hopefully also for the future of design .
and with just a magnifying glass , he transcribed as much of the text as he could .
and ramos told wald , according to witnesses , &quot; i &apos;m not going to leave you . &quot;
he said what scientists do when a paradigm fails is , guess what — they carry on as if nothing had happened .
experts agree that it &apos;s impossible to farm cows for every inhabitant on this planet .
we observe facial expressions , body language , and we can intuit feelings and emotions from our dialogue with one another .
so she said , &quot; &quot; everybody in palestine , in where ? israel ?
they would just get frustrated with you .
most people long to overcome pettiness and become part of something larger .
i believe that , ultimately , we can overcome the digitally empowered networks of extremism , demagoguery and hate .
at work , we &apos;re so busy communicating that we often don &apos;t have time to think , we don &apos;t have time to talk , about the things that really matter .
there are some things that helped me , i think , be better than i would have been .
the main point of all this for me is , we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species .

every day now for 18 years — every single day — i &apos;ve had to try to decide the combinations and mixtures of chemicals , and try to get them , to stay alive .
on march 14 , this year , i posted this poster on facebook .
that &apos;s part of you up there .
here in 2009 , you know , it &apos;s not an easy thing to be a forest ecologist , gripping ourselves with these kinds of questions and trying to figure out how we can answer them .
fabulous , lots of people talk about this .
let &apos;s dive , let &apos;s reach out the reality we live in every day , and look carefully at it , since that &apos;s what we need .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples .
you have a series of buttons . you actually choose your lift music .
at one point , it went , &quot; &quot; guys and dolls : the musical , &quot; &quot; &quot; last tango in paris , &quot; &quot; diary of a wimpy kid , &quot; &quot; porn star : legend of ron jeremy . &quot;
ag : well , i don &apos;t think i would write any message .
i &apos;ve got , you know , this enormous balloon above me , it &apos;s the biggest parachute ever , why not use it ?
what is a bird ?
( music ) ( applause ) ( applause ) ( music ) ( applause ) ( music ) ( applause ) chris anderson : you guys were amazing .
the saudi blogger raif badawi has been jailed and flogged for insulting islam and criticizing the saudi regime on his blog .
they typically make the best out of their conditions , and try to make their spaces look nice and homey , or at least up until as far as they can reach .
let &apos;s see if we can understand glucose response .
you know we have up to five tastes , three of them sustain us .
we don &apos;t have to be subjected as second , but they have to know that women , as we are in this room , we are not just women , we are not just girls , we are extraordinary .
thank you very much .
abuse thrives only in silence .
we collaborated with the local community and built , out of recycled materials of their own , this fantastical floating platform that gently moved in the ocean as we watched films from the british film archive , &#91; 1903 &#93; &quot; &quot; alice in wonderland , &quot; &quot; for example .
friends , this has never happened , where everybody in the prison studies .
it &apos;s not going to happen , you know , in one year , but it &apos;s an important , deeply economic and cultural change that happens through children .
and poets , like other artists , play with those intuitive understandings .
pm : so how do we get this balance we &apos;re looking for , then , in the world ?
he set an ambitious goal : he wanted kenya to be ranked top 50 in this world bank ranking .
now , why do i say that ?
but now it &apos;s not falling , because there , with help from pepfar , it &apos;s working with treatment . and people are not dying .
and i &apos;m talking about the very end .
for the first time ever , african pain and african aspiration has the ability to be witnessed by those who can empathize with it the most : other africans .
more than 700,000 children in the united states aged 18 and under begin smoking every year .
this guy thought in the same way i did .
and particularly , how can it lead to the creation of buildings which consume less energy , create less pollution and are more socially responsible ?
it had gone through , like , five or six families , and it was just a big thing for us , and we found actually an old picture of somebody and their family years ago .
i came back home , told my mother , &quot; i &apos;d like to live and work in a village . &quot;
so to combat this , we tether ourselves with science .
that led us to think that maybe people with strong motivations and strong goals to exercise might actually see the finish line as closer than people who have weaker motivations .
any of those can be opened up .
somebody dance ! come on !
it &apos;d be lousy not to get a job one is qualified for , but it would triple suck if it was because of stack overflow in some subroutine .
so , the last thing we did , very quickly , is i took all those wish balloons — there were 117 interviews , 117 wishes — and i brought them up to a place called dochula , which is a mountain pass in bhutan , at 10,300 feet , one of the more sacred places in bhutan .
and i &apos;m also proud to announce that you &apos;re getting a sneak preview — on friday we &apos;re going to announce that we &apos;re actually forming a team to develop a system to grow plants on the moon , which is going to be pretty fun .
and then my teacher looks at me sort of concerned about halfway through the class and says , &quot; &quot; are you feeling ok ? &quot; &quot; i &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; are you kidding ? am i feeling ok ?
what i &apos;ve learned is that the most effective people and teams in any domain do something we can all emulate .
but as we enter , the ground drops below us and our perception shifts , where we realize that these columns evoke the lynchings , which happened in the public square .
you &apos;ve got the red-hat triathletes over there .
let me just give you an example from a recent study that we conducted . we asked participants to just simply give us their opinion of a variety of social groups , and we either made the room smell gross or not .
( laughter ) but of course , it &apos;s 2016 , so there &apos;s an app for that . ( laughter )
millions of in-the-ear hearing aids are already 3d printed today .
you know , she eats small portions .
i think we &apos;d all be pretty comfortable with this guy doing it .
but there has been a huge amount of progress .
so in a stage two culture — and we find these in all sorts of different places — you find them , in fact , in the best organizations in the world .
the first since this man , franklin delano roosevelt , who began his own unprecedented journey way back at his own first election , way back in a simpler time , way back in 1932 — ( laughter ) the year alberto giacometti ( laughter ) made &quot; &quot; the palace at four in the morning . &quot; &quot; the year , let &apos;s remember , that this voice , now departed , first came a-cryin &apos; into this big old crazy world of ours .
and he still is holding this line .
thank you very much .
so , i &apos;m pretty pleased with it all .
desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert , and this happens only when we create too much bare ground .
after the final &quot; &quot; no &quot; &quot; comes a &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; when any great moral challenge is ultimately resolved into a binary choice between what is right and what is wrong , the outcome is fore-ordained because of who we are as human beings .
wouldn &apos;t it be better , or more informative , or more useful , if instead we could look at the view like this .
and i really wanted to share with you a very special moment of my life and the history of the city of rio .
it may be the next rainforest , in terms of pharmaceuticals .
what do men have to do with gender equality ?
in fact , most of the rights that we have today in this country — as women , as minorities , as workers , as people of different sexual orientations and citizens concerned with the environment — these rights weren &apos;t handed to us .
is the destruction of the world inevitable ? should i have children ?
and if you remember that — raise your hands if you could .
&#91; a good conversation is like a miniskirt ; short enough to retain interest , but long enough to cover the subject . — my sister &#93; ( laughter ) ( applause ) all of this boils down to the same basic concept , and it is this one : be interested in other people .
these are really great things .
the rest of the world might casually encourage or even expect some sort of north korean spring , but i don &apos;t want you to do anything risky , because i know in your world , someone is always watching .
will this solve the problem ? will economics solve everything ?
but it &apos;s just not practical .
so those who are &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; raise your hand . &quot; &quot; for . &quot; &quot; okay , hands down .
the higher education system failed patrick , debbie and wael , exactly as it is failing millions of potential students , millions that graduate high school , millions that are qualified for higher education , millions that want to study yet cannot access for various reasons .
those fossil fuels have built our civilization .
and so , we wanted to find out might we be able to use hydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold , and we wanted to see whether we could reproduce this skier in a mammal .
and that changes everything .
because now it &apos;s become socially not acceptable not to show up to support your children at the manchester craftsmen &apos;s guild because people think you &apos;re bad parents .
this misinformation destroyed the credibility of the source , and it &apos;s harmed the credibility of other reliable and trustworthy sources .
one that i &apos;ll highlight here is changing the patient &apos;s name .
but today , the way i want you to understand a black hole , for the proof of a black hole , is to think of it as an object whose mass is confined to zero volume .
there &apos;s something else in that .
in 2003 , the whitney mounted a retrospective of our work that featured a lot of this work from the &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s .
but donna &apos;s biggest supporter came from an unexpected place .
now as you &apos;re reading , however , you will be maybe surprised that you will quickly become numb to the numbers of deaths , because you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers of faceless , nameless dead people .
and the reasons for their absence are given in my text panel .
it helps them suggest books for me to read or movies for my family to watch or friends for us to connect with .
how many of you use facebook photos , google photos , instagram ?
you work on the front lines . and you &apos;ve seen the best and the worst that human beings can do for one another and to one another .
so after dinner , the orchestra started to play , and the guests burst into song , and all of a sudden , taft was surprised with the presentation of a gift from a group of local supporters , and this was a stuffed opossum toy , all beady-eyed and bald-eared , and it was a new product they were putting forward to be the william taft presidency &apos;s answer to teddy roosevelt &apos;s teddy bear .
i &apos;m going to ask you to go ahead and put a blindfold on .
they had none of that .
and all i &apos;m going to try and prove to you with these slides is that i do just very straight stuff .
it &apos;s not telling the parents , &quot; &quot; if you see paralysis , take your child to the doctor or get your child vaccinated . &quot; &quot; we have a problem with marketing in the donor community .
was this a good idea ?
this is gen9 gene assembler , and so right now when you try to print a gene , what you do is somebody in a factory with pipettes puts the thing together by hand , you have one error per 100 base pairs , and it takes a long time and costs a lot of money .
and so while other kids were bbm-ing their parents , i was literally waiting by the mailbox to get a letter from home to see how the weekend had gone , which was a little frustrating when grandma was in the hospital , but i was just looking for some sort of scribble , some unkempt cursive from my mother .
if it has a subject , the subject is adolescence .
in my book i talked about the fact that 72 percent of people trust what other people say about a brand or a company , versus 15 percent on advertising .
let &apos;s start with the world of 1945 .
first of all , was that dance , even though it hadn &apos;t been offered to her , was her life .
here &apos;s the story i was telling : the gods up there , there were two people .
so it &apos;s the same way , like those action video games have a number of ingredients that are actually really powerful for brain plasticity , learning , attention , vision , etc . , and so we need and we &apos;re working on understanding what are those active ingredients so that we can really then leverage them to deliver better games , either for education or for rehabilitation of patients .
and i said , &quot; &quot; go read it . &quot; &quot; and they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; oh , that one wasn &apos;t so awesome . &quot; &quot; and then we went to another one — it didn &apos;t have great visuals , but it had great information — and spent an hour talking about the learning process , because it wasn &apos;t about whether or not it was perfect , or whether or not it was what i could create .
and then at my worst moments : why did i make such a stupid mistake ?
all the things that make a great city successful and all the things that make a great city stimulating — they were all on display there on those streets .
if i &apos;m going to teach my daughter about electronics , i &apos;m not going to give her a soldering iron .
( laughter ) ( applause ) and because it &apos;s so badass , those flags and crosses are found throughout amsterdam , just like chicago , they &apos;re used .
but race is a bad proxy .
so i would say , coquo ergo sum : i cook , therefore i am .
but it actually turns out that your cells sit in this mesh of complicated fibers , proteins and sugars known as the extracellular matrix .
so , how do you do imitation ? why is imitation important ?
they don &apos;t have the frontal cortex .
so , in soap , fatty acids made from boiling pork bone fat are used as a hardening agent , but also for giving it a pearl-like effect .
and the good news is , nine years later , you can see improvements in quality and equity .
and in my case , as i was about five years old , this meant asking my mum .
finally , four great industrial sectors combined .
so what do you do when everything is out there ?
it &apos;s perfect for that particular context .
you know , they might have a solution .
so this is a sleeping baby , and under its nose , we &apos;ve put a clean glass rod .
( laughter ) powerful opponents are not going to give people what they want just because they asked nicely ...
dr : well the truth of the matter is , post-september 11th , i felt myself in the role originally — first of all as someone who lives in tribeca and whose neighborhood was devastated , and as someone who works less than a mile from there — that i was in the role of forcing 100 people who work with me in my firm , to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm about creating the places we had been creating .
those are the two choices we have . i know which future i would rather be living in .
here you have sub-saharan africa , south asia , east asia , arab states , east europe , latin america , and oecd .
( laughter ) and finally , it &apos;s okay for the speaker — that &apos;s the good news — to fake intellectual capacity .
and this is where we &apos;re actually going .
and when i would go back to swaziland , i would be constantly confronted by how very non-swazi i was becoming .
( laughter ) remember this ?
i &apos;m going to say almost not at all .
if we zoom in on this photograph right here , we can see it &apos;s a really nice photograph to have of her , because she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the same time to get a nice image of her facial texture .
and we can all make that choice .
instead , innovation , if you remember , some of you may have read the famous economist schumpeter , he said , &quot; &quot; innovation is novelty in how value is created and distributed . &quot; &quot; it could be new products and services , but it could also be new ways of producing products .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been working on the last couple of years , and that &apos;s what we need to be working on together — rethinking everything from the ground up , with a holistic view across the value chain , connecting all these things across the globe , alongside great entrepreneurs that are willing to share a collective vision .
and that it wasn &apos;t until 2009 , when president obama signed off on a surge , that we finally had , in the words of secretary clinton , &quot; the strategy , the leadership and the resources . &quot;
another answer might be , well , it came from a sort of lone genius working in his garage , who , working away on different kinds of bikes , comes up with a bike out of thin air .
but mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when i am one of the biggest beneficiaries .
there is so many things to do ; it &apos;s so fresh .
some of our kids started talking with their parents , others with their teachers , or with their friends .
and like a fool , i didn &apos;t go to the ceremony because i didn &apos;t think we were going to win .
because , after all , in that framework , between page one and 300 , you have to answer this question of why things happen , how things happen , in what order they happen . what are the influences ?
why ? i think there are three reasons , two long-term ones and the trigger .
luckily now things have changed because i came to discover the truth .
my friend red maxwell has spent the last 10 years fighting against juvenile diabetes .
but even with that , there still was another big hurdle , and that actually brings us back to the mapping of the human genome , because we &apos;re all different .
because physics doesn &apos;t give a damn about your gender .
so i too got one of those baby monitors so that i could see my daughter when she was asleep .
and so if language really is the solution to the crisis of visual theft , if language really is the conduit of our cooperation , the technology that our species derived to promote the free flow and exchange of ideas , in our modern world , we confront a question .
in the end , what really makes a government healthy is when healthy cells — that &apos;s you and i — get to the ground , roll up our sleeves , refuse to be helpless and believe that sometimes , all it takes is for us to create some space for healthy cells to grow and thrive .
it uses lots of pesticides , lots of fertilizer , lots of water .
i could relate to this homo erectus skeleton very well , because i was the same age that he was when he died .
this kind , intelligent young man from new jersey had just committed suicide .
and whenever we saw a flock of birds that had electronic communication , we thought , &apos; probably has something to do with the americans . &apos; &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; yeah .
this was really an extraordinary advance , because although these cells are not human embryonic stem cells , which still remain the gold standard , they are terrific to use for modeling disease and potentially for drug discovery .
when we face these crises , we have kept the potential , the huge potential of our society out of this process , and we are closing in on ourselves in politics , and i think we need to change that , to really find new participatory ways using the great capabilities that now exist even in technology but not only in technology , the minds that we have , and i think we can find solutions which are much better , but we have to be open .
for instance , you could find women who feel &quot; &quot; addicted &quot; &quot; in their 20s when it was cloudy in bangladesh .
the purple-painters and the green-painters fight over who &apos;s going to paint that bit behind the curtain ? no .
so even as we worry about it , we have allowed it to go on in this country — much different in europe — without any regulation , and even without any identification on the package .
we &apos;re all , under certain circumstances , willfully blind .
and they face a daily struggle with social stigma , with family despair , and with religious fire and brimstone .
there are too many people that think that high-technology medicine is going to keep them , save them , from overeating , from eating a lot of fast foods , from not getting any exercise .
it &apos;s getting more oxygen to your brain .
we insist on faith in the future and in each other .
how is technology changing love ?
this is another one from the woods .
imagine that was lake huron .
shouldn &apos;t you be doing something about this ? why haven &apos;t you had it removed ? &quot; &quot; and other children in curiosity come up and poke the lesion , because — a natural curiosity .
couldn &apos;t find a shred of evidence .
this is called hooked on a feeling : the pursuit of happiness and human design .
the icelandic prime minister had to resign .
but from about the age of five , i was aware that i didn &apos;t fit .
these are indicators that give you a much better read about the socioeconomic development of a country .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
whatever they could do , the earth &apos;s resilience would soon heal human activities .
the extreme might be in italy where , again , there &apos;s kind of some type of control over what &apos;s happening in the environment is very evident , even in the way that they sell and distribute periodicals .
i want to introduce you to an amazing woman .
and i asked her if she loved her baby .
can you possibly help ? &quot; &quot; let me describe haryana a little bit to you .
over the course of human history , starvation has been a much bigger problem than overeating .
before , i was an architect , and my grandmother asked me once , &quot; what are you doing for a living ? &quot;
you &apos;re looking at brine pools formed by salt diapirs .
just using a checklist requires you to embrace different values from the ones we &apos;ve had , like humility , discipline , teamwork .
i wasn &apos;t quite sure how to answer the question .
in america , we &apos;re all familiar with the term &quot; &quot; the american dream . &quot; &quot; i think it &apos;s time , across the world , that we &apos;re able to think also of something we might also call a dream for all humankind .
it &apos;s been there for three days , and it &apos;s laying on its back .
in fact , they raised more than 13,000 dollars to reward him for this discovery , raising a vital discussion in the technology industry about how we come up with incentives for hackers to do the right thing .
we make a practice of ignoring those limitations .
this is the netherlands , 2011 .
police took this blurry photo of me holding leaflets as evidence .
seventy percent — it &apos;s unbelievable .
if the breast is less than 25 percent dense , that &apos;s called fatty-replaced .
there must be hundreds of thousands of blind people who have these hallucinations , but are too scared to mention them .
and richard meier , who was one of my teachers , kept coming over to my desk to give me criticism , and he would say , &quot; &quot; bill , you &apos;ve got to understand- — solar energy has nothing to do with architecture . &quot; &quot; i guess he didn &apos;t read vitruvius .
you can find it on the east coast as well as the west coast , and often the symbols are very well preserved , so each of these symbols has four bits — it &apos;s a four-bit binary word — you draw these lines in the sand randomly , and then you count off , and if it &apos;s an odd number , you put down one stroke , and if it &apos;s an even number , you put down two strokes .
if our airplane is too heavy , if the pilot wastes energy , we &apos;ll never make it through the night .
( laughter ) if you do that , you might think , &quot; &quot; oh great . i &apos;m going to do my best work when i &apos;m in my 20s . &quot; &quot; but guess what , nobody will really care . ( laughter )
people died , including the crew of apollo 1 .
&quot; &quot; find it yourself , &quot; &quot; they said .
in fact , everybody in this room probably , especially if you picked up your bag — some of you , i know , didn &apos;t pick up your bags — but if you picked up your bag , everybody in this room has got in their pocket , or back in their room , something that 350 years ago , kings would have gone to war to have .
and this is a place where people not only reach age 100 , they do so with extraordinary vigor .
dh : now obviously , this is not something we do on our regular show ; it &apos;s something we just kind of learned for this , so we &apos;re going to try . but can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs ?
it reminded me a lot of the talk we heard this morning , about this operating room machinery that was designed specifically for africa .
so we &apos;re in the process of helping them design deep-well , low-cost manual pumps in order for these people who have a quarter acre of land to be able to grow crops in the off-season .
the best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you and try and — i want to get more on this that we could share along with the talk.as : wonderful .
so , that &apos;s an empty parka jacket .
and i could list more .
i was in a doctor &apos;s office last cat scan , and there was a reader &apos;s digest , october 2002 .
well , i actually don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to be the case .
but i really think this is a phenomenon that can inspire us .
they have come up with , in a sense , a different method for organizing activity .
the night before a match i &apos;m very nervous .
and because kuznets &apos; invention was found to be so useful , it spread around the world .
and just like the strings on a violin , they can vibrate in different patterns producing different musical notes .
and what we learned is cesar &apos;s work is far too good to explain in the new york times magazine .
this emerging economy really is helping the revival of the world economy .
and i think in life it should be exactly like this .
physicists and chemists have had nearly a century of trying to get used to this weirdness .
for me , this is about exploring human limits , about exploring the limits of physiology , of psychology and of technology . they &apos;re the things that excite me .
they don &apos;t usually get significant access to assistance .
you had to have quite a flair for the dramatic , and be really , really quick .
75 percent of people admit doing private conversations from work on their mobile phones .
thank you very much .
lighting in practice is placing lights inside this three-dimensional world .
which one of these guys am i actually related to ?
similarly , there &apos;s the work of people like marti guixe that tries to involve you in a way that is really about making everything pass through your mouth so that you learn from your mistakes or from your taste , orally .
so there was always going to be a tension within that .
mental note to the liberators : throwaway plastics take a lot of space and don &apos;t biodegrade .
rajiv suffers from a mental illness .
but i do think that being involved in the genesis of this really puts me and my colleagues in a position of responsibility .
but then , in the &apos; 90s , something began to unravel .
it &apos;s also hot , huge and unruly , made up of 17,000 islands , where people speak close to a thousand languages .
you probably haven &apos;t seen anything like this out there .
we have 31 brigades in the u.s.
i still love being close to someone reading to me .
and what &apos;s fantastic is that this symbol is not a thing , it &apos;s not an image , it &apos;s not an artifact , actually it &apos;s a space , and it &apos;s kind of just defined by a line of buildings on either side .
and yes , you also interact using natural gestures , both hands , etc .
we &apos;re using whatever leverage we have to bring them to the table .
we called people for help , and nobody came .
it &apos;s the indication that it &apos;s the best foie gras .
then another year goes by .
now , tonya also talked about working with a mentor , and this is really important to talk about , because if organizations , talent and performance systems aren &apos;t giving people in general information about the importance of business , strategic and financial acumen , how are men getting to the top ?
a friend of mine , an indian friend of mine , went to his grandfather when he was very young , a child , and said to him , &quot; i want to talk to you about religion , &quot; and his grandfather said , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re too young .
well here &apos;s how we &apos;re going to do it .
could you give me a flight ? because we &apos;re going to go see him . &quot; &quot; and of course , we went and saw him and it was amazing .
so , rather than have it fight or do industrial work , we decided to build a planter , put the robot into the center of it , and we called it the telegarden .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to leave you with this final thought .
in britain , 63 percent of all men who come out of short sentences from prison re-offend again within a year .
and these telescopes , among other things , they &apos;re being used to study how the expansion of the universe is changing with time .
chinese is always cheating , right ?
the matter around the star is dragged around , and some energy from that rotation is transferred to that matter and the magnetic field is increased even further .
one in nine people in the world suffers from undernourishment .
and that &apos;s the sad part .
both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise , and both of them , because they &apos;re manufacturers , create jobs directly , and create incomes indirectly , because they &apos;re in the malaria sector , and africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year because of malaria .
dm : and now i &apos;ll attach the filter to the drums , so i can control the effect live . video : ( music )
so they &apos;ve managed to both restore the local ecology and the local economy at the same time .
and if you look at the light , it is illuminating as you would expect .
matt has also helped me to set up an organization that i &apos;m working with that has the name taken from the title of a book i wrote , &quot; the life you can save , &quot; which is trying to change our culture so that more people think that if we &apos;re going to live an ethical life , it &apos;s not enough just to follow the thou-shalt-nots and not cheat , steal , maim , kill , but that if we have enough , we have to share some of that with people who have so little .
our tissues all have very different abilities to regenerate , and here we see poor prometheus , who made a rather tricky career choice and was punished by the greek gods .
now the reason we did this is that humans are not very good at picking random words .
i sent nick off . nick came back .
it was kind of like being an astronaut , because we were getting to see things and go places that no one had ever seen or gone to before .
sanghamitra didn &apos;t start life as a leader of an ngo , she started her career as university professor , teaching english literature .
so we wanted to change the way that students approach technology , to create a more convivial and social space that was more engaging , more accessible , and also to increase the ability for teachers to use these spaces for technology-based instruction .
it &apos;s only 10 years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free-living organism , that of haemophilus influenzae .
she &apos;s in the studio with him for a long time .
( laughter ) but homage to singapore .
i was born in israel to a right-wing family , and as long as i remember myself , i wanted to join the israeli army to serve my country and prove what i believed was our right for the whole land .
our circumstances are different , but you &apos;re the same as us .
the end of the cold war and the disintegration of the soviet union .
this is fascinating . you probably know , some of you , that cells are continually renewed . you can see it in skin and this kind of stuff .
the more time i spent around these people and saw this problem , i thought , what if we could create a community , a place where people could feel like they belonged and that it was ok to do things differently , to take the road less traveled , where that was encouraged , and inspire people to change ?
i think we &apos;ve all read the grimms &apos; fairy tales , which are , indeed , very grim .
maybe we just follow our gut .
and second , it gives us the opportunity to understand how these supermassive black holes interact with their environment , and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution of the galaxies which they reside in .
my point is here , people have a choice — just like the indian lady could wear her sari or the japanese woman could wear her kimono .
they have the same share that we have .
mr : we used &quot; &quot; mary had a little lamb &quot; &quot; because those are said to be the first words that thomas edison spoke into his phonograph in 1877 .
if any — those of you who are older in the audience know that when i was a child we understood that a child born with a cleft palate was born with what we called mental retardation .
rl : so there are , when our legitimate foreign intelligence targets of the type that i described before , use the global telecommunications system as their communications methodology , and they do , because it &apos;s a great system , it &apos;s the most complex system ever devised by man , and it is a wonder , and lots of folks in the room there are responsible for the creation and enhancement of that , and it &apos;s just a wonderful thing .
so it turns out that being paid less and praised less has its upsides — for society at least .
in about four months of release , we &apos;ve brought that population of mosquitos — in most cases we &apos;re dealing with villages here of about 2,000 , 3,000 people , that sort of size , starting small — we &apos;ve taken that mosquito population down by about 85 percent in about four months .
( applause ) how about that ? how about we create a better world for nothing ?
and that &apos;s johnny depp &apos;s shoulder .
and with the right kind of help , maybe one day i could get better .
the existential and social and political impact an artist has on his nation &apos;s development of cultural identity is very important .
at the moment , they &apos;re incarcerated .
well , it &apos;s not . &quot; &quot; e.t. &quot; &quot; is about divorce . &quot; &quot; e.t. &quot; &quot; is about a heartbroken , divorce-crippled family , and ultimately , this kid who can &apos;t find his way .
that &apos;s an inconvenience compared to having both of them gone . &quot; &quot; i got a day job , and my nights and weekends are already filled up with things like , let &apos;s supply water to the world , and power to the world , and educate all the kids , which , chris , i will not talk about . i don &apos;t need another mission .
once it &apos;s perceived , and someone brings it into their own mind , then there &apos;s a cycle that has been completed .
one death every 20 seconds .
we &apos;re trying to make sure that clinicians , and therefore their systems that they work in have the ability , the confidence to address the problems in the living and working conditions in our lives .
so we &apos;ve started roundtables where we bring together the entire value chain , from producers all the way to the retailers and brands .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re all avid &quot; &quot; american idol &quot; &quot; watchers .
( laughter ) we &apos;ll loop around here in just a second , and you &apos;ll see another one .
do you think that your discussion may serve as a blueprint for other fields ?
it &apos;s got a fan , it &apos;s got headlights for warmth , it &apos;s got door chimes for alarm — it runs off a car battery .
one of the problems , when you get too much chatter , it &apos;s hard to process all the packets , so you have to prioritize , and that &apos;s where the predictive model helps you .
this was after the fall of gaddafi , but before libya turned into full-blown civil war .
the brief is that the bus should use 40 percent less energy .
orchids : there are 20,000 , at least , species of orchids — amazingly , amazingly diverse .
and so we could choose numbers of positions on the face to pull that data from .
so again , memory is the city , memory is the world .
but i want to concentrate on the role of investment in seeking out novelty , the production and consumption of novelty .
the river flows wider than a two-lane road along most of its path .
loose associations involves putting together words that may sound a lot alike but don &apos;t make sense , and if the words get jumbled up enough , it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; word salad . &quot; &quot; contrary to what many people think , schizophrenia is not the same as multiple personality disorder or split personality .
in most parts of the us , the baseline expectation in public is that we maintain a balance between civility and privacy .
now , i hope that mayors do one day rule the world , but , you know , the fact is , we don &apos;t hear any conversation , really , about what is happening in the south .
now , at some point i was in hawaii — i like to hike and surf and do all that weird stuff , and i was making a collage for my ma .
stop looking where you &apos;re going , turn , check your blind spot , and drive down the road without looking where you &apos;re going .
it &apos;s plastic pollution .
and i know you want to look and see if those spots are still there .
growing up , i had a nickname .
so being a mechanical engineer , being at mit and having lots of resources available to me , i thought i &apos;d try to do something about it .
let me tell you a story about a little girl named naghma .
on the last day , we met her majesty the queen of norway , and twitter couldn &apos;t quite handle it .
i &apos;m taking data from the u.n. — it &apos;s the same as the world bank has — on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies .
the logarithmic scale hides the scale of the increase , because this represents trillions-fold increase since the 1890 census .
one hint : it &apos;s not &quot; &quot; l. &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) it could be an &quot; &quot; l , &quot; &quot; of course .
this was incredible ; this is what i wanted to do .
that is , share your lunch .
so for example , in a power plant , when your big steam turbine gets too over speed , you must open relief valves within a millisecond .
it is too expensive for humanity .
remember in your car you have a gas tank .
and many of these muslims further say that their disagreement with the united states is that it , in the past and still in the present , has sided with autocratic rulers in the muslim world in order to promote america &apos;s short-term interests .
the whole world came running , and it was a bizarre experience , because everybody , from everywhere : &quot; &quot; who are they ? what are they ? how many are they ?
you &apos;re reading about this smart stuff , this intelligent dissection of the immune system .
today , we are beginning to understand how to interrupt the progression from early adversity to disease and early death , and 30 years from now , the child who has a high ace score and whose behavioral symptoms go unrecognized , whose asthma management is not connected , and who goes on to develop high blood pressure and early heart disease or cancer will be just as anomalous as a six-month mortality from hiv / aids .
and here we go !
and anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask and cover all of the extraneous parts of their body .
so what needs to be done ?
it is to make a super difference in the performance of others , with whom we are compared .
which side are you on ?
so he went to the church of nativity and brought back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen jesus being born .
a one million-person city per week with 10,000 dollars per family .
it says &quot; &quot; dreams &quot; &quot; at the top .
you know the incident .
this is the case . there are no other cases . &quot; &quot; and in that moment of desire and focus , he can win .
a single four-foot female had 300 million eggs , can carry 300 million eggs in her ovaries — imagine — and they get to be over 10 feet long . imagine what a 10 foot one has .
and the saying goes , we came from dust and will return to dust .
yes , it is . it &apos;s our work — that was a while ago , and it still is my favorite project — of teleconferencing .
and if you turn the lights on , you might periodically see spectacular organisms swim by , because those are the denizens of the deep , the things that live in the deep ocean .
it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; among the school children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o body swayed to music / o brightening glance / how &#91; can we know &#93; the dancer from the dance ? &quot; &quot; and here is merce cunningham , i was fortunate to dance with him when i was younger , and here he is a dancer , and while he is dancing , he is both the dancer and the dance .
and so , you know , for example , with these devices , patients can see simple things like bright lights and high contrast edges , not very much more , so nothing close to normal vision has been possible .
so it &apos;s these two totally different perceptions of my personality .
in other words , everything you need to do in order to remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed by mid-adolescence , whereas in contrast , if you look at the last two gray bars , there &apos;s still a significant improvement in the director condition between mid-adolescence and adulthood , and what this means is that the ability to take into account someone else &apos;s perspective in order to guide ongoing behavior , which is something , by the way , that we do in everyday life all the time , is still developing in mid-to-late adolescence .
this ain &apos;t going to be my last movie .
we are talking here about , oftentimes , very young individuals with spinal cord injuries , that in the prime of their life — 20s , 30s , 40s — hit a wall and the wheelchair &apos;s the only option .
what i will focus on in my talk is why they matter , how they matter , and what we can all do to make sure that they continue to matter in the right ways , that is , how all of us can contribute to developing and honing the skills of local and global leaders to make peace and to make it last .
and i am going to be their help along the way .
in ringing babylonian — it was written in babylonian — he says , &quot; &quot; i am cyrus , king of all the universe , the great king , the powerful king , king of babylon , king of the four quarters of the world . &quot; &quot; they &apos;re not shy of hyperbole as you can see .
i remember having to use vodka — my own vodka — to pickle it because we don &apos;t carry formaldehyde .
and because of this action , that contract was vacated , and now this has sparked a movement in mexico city which is home to one of our partners , code for mexico city .
now , what about what else is going on out there in the universe ?
forget the &apos; 60s . we can change the world .
and then people came .
this year &apos;s h1n1 threat was actually a human , avian , swine mixture that arose in mexico .
even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford .
that &apos;s a lot of pressure . &quot; &quot; i just wanted a blessing , i didn &apos;t want some kind of mandate .
it is with this context that ushahidi came to be .
but i will continue to consider this idea , and i will report back maybe next year .
we treat biotechnology with the same scrutiny we apply to nuclear power plants .
at the same time the city had this need .
between them , these new revenue flows dwarf aid .
then there &apos;s the r-word , proving that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to far too many people .
just two things .
i think it really is transparency and secrecy .
it &apos;s an algorithm that actually allows you to browse the actual museum &apos;s collection using facial recognition .
and i think what it is is i don &apos;t think we have fully come to terms with the meaning of this disaster , with what it meant to witness a hole ripped in our world , with what it meant to watch the contents of the earth gush forth on live tv , 24 hours a day , for months .
we have a video to show you .
( laughter ) td : but it didn &apos;t turn out to be so fun and entertaining , as i thought it would have been .
with our strengths and our minds and spirit , we gather , we form , and we fashion .
and that is the migraine invention that we are talking about and that we are working on .
you need to look at all of the different transportation routes as well .
for nearly a decade afterwards , risen was the subject of a us government investigation in which prosecutors demanded that he testify against one of his alleged sources .
so let me show you how the system works .
there &apos;s a wonderful book called &quot; &quot; crowns &quot; &quot; that &apos;s all these glamour pictures of black women in their church hats .
and they were holding it in their laps .
and making sense of the financial crisis is very , very difficult .
it sort of ended abruptly when she was executed — ( laughter ) — for murdering 600 men . you see , it wasn &apos;t a very good perfume .
whether it &apos;s like the shark in &quot; &quot; jaws &quot; &quot; — if spielberg &apos;s mechanical shark , bruce , had worked , it would not be remotely as scary ; you would have seen it too much .
ten years ago , however , the promise of democracy seemed to be extraordinary . george w. bush stood up in his state of the union address in 2003 and said that democracy was the force that would beat most of the ills of the world . he said , because democratic governments respect their own people and respect their neighbors , freedom will bring peace .
all other species on this planet are gene machines only , they don &apos;t imitate at all well , hardly at all .
and i said , first of all , let me do the calculation on that compound , bottom right , which is related to coumarin , but has an extra pentagon inserted into the molecule .
is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
but it can &apos;t be the fault of somebody like this .
they used to use cardboard boxes years ago and we still use them .
we could rerun that play a lot better now .
i need to rest . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) iranians , sometimes we do two , sometimes we do three .
in kyrgyzstan , just over the last few weeks , unprecedented levels of violence occurred between ethnic kyrgyz and ethnic uzbeks .
but it is just physiology . it &apos;s just in your brain .
however , only recently , due to several technological advancements , we are now able to demonstrate to you quantum levitation and quantum locking .
and it works the exact same way .
this shows the artistic impulses inside us are suppressed , not gone .
so , we have to work out who influences problems .
it &apos;s an extraordinary place .
that punch card system inspired victorian inventor charles babbage to create his analytical engine , the first true programmable computer ever designed .
globalization has been taken to support a neoliberal agenda .
so i look at that question from a bit of a different lens , and i want to know , how can we prevent concussion ?
and people are okay with it .
and so , i want to kind of go through my little story of what i found out .
the one that this step is enabling us to do is coming next .
and this is the same thing you see when people compress video to send : they want to make it very sparse , because that file is smaller . and this is what the retina is doing , and it &apos;s doing it just with the circuitry , and how this network of neurons that are interacting in there , which we &apos;ve captured on the chip .
what is this about ?
but dragonflies — a bit tricky .
over the spanish steps we go .
i find this a particularly apt description of science and how science works — bumbling around in a dark room , bumping into things , trying to figure out what shape this might be , what that might be , there are reports of a cat somewhere around , they may not be reliable , they may be , and so forth and so on .
coke &apos;s been in africa since 1928 , but most of the time they couldn &apos;t reach the distant markets , because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world , which was a large truck rolling down the street .
there &apos;s no breeding pairs left .
so what we found is that the bursts last long enough in order to support wave resonances , which are things caused by exchanges of energy between particles that may have been excited , that depend on the volume .
every time we lead one of these efforts we have to whip ourselves into this imminent threat thing .
and the women decided that they would train not the next generation of girls , because they had grown too old already , but the next generation .
so i get a basic idea as to what you might be about , what you might like , what you might do as a profession , etc . , etc .
you can &apos;t — okay .
and you know , lego — don &apos;t take legos to lego .
did you know the world games happened this year ?
more protein than a hunter &apos;s family could eat before it rotted .
it &apos;s a seductive place , isn &apos;t it ?
he goes down to the basement and starts to check the wiring , and then gradually works his way up to the top of the building , apartment by apartment , checking every television , checking every connection , hoping to find out what this problem is .
what &apos;s happened here , again , almost without our knowing , is our culture has changed .
for any new requirement , you have a dedicated function in charge of aligning engineers against the new requirement .
and this makes us interested in real brains and neuroscience as well , and especially interested in the things that our brains do that are still far superior to the performance of computers .
he said , &quot; &quot; there are only two things that matter in music : what and how .
they &apos;re just information , why would they ?
but if i show you this picture it &apos;s not to tell you how happy we were .
but kiribati is comprised of three groups of islands : the gilbert group on the west , we have the phoenix islands in the middle , and the line islands in the east .
and so we needed grants . and he used significant grants to research , to experiment , to fail , to innovate and try again .
for example , it is counterintuitive to have an illiterate study participant , like celine , sign a lengthy consent form that they are unable to read , let alone understand .
now , as it happens , warren buffett is not only himself a plutocrat , he is one of the most astute observers of that phenomenon , and he has his own favorite number .
well , you are to ride a bicycle , carrying your own weight and also some other weight , so that you can earn the bread for the day .
it extends from the subatomic scale to the farthest reaches of the cosmos .
i was 13 months when they removed my left eye .
the other volunteer who had arrived just before me — let &apos;s call him lex luther — ( laughter ) got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner &apos;s dog .
better said , what the angular resolution is of the things that you see .
&quot; &quot; i don &apos;t need your help , &quot; &quot; he said .
there wasn &apos;t ddt , there wasn &apos;t chloroquines : what do they do ?
the world is changed by our maps of the world .
they &apos;re all coming in at this time , walking across there , just kind of leisurely coming in .
i have and i offer a gospel of doubt .
so &quot; &quot; justin . &quot; &quot; is that the name of the user , their boyfriend , their son ?
they &apos;re driven by this duty and this obligation .
&#91; shit &#93; this is arguably the back end of the design of animals .
so what should we do now ?
and i thought the secret of the site was to make the building of the river , part of the river .
and companies that actually define a true north , things that are nonnegotiable whether times are good , bad , ugly — doesn &apos;t matter .
the stock market has been on a roll , going up as everybody knows , and price-earnings ratios have grown .
he said he &apos;d lived his whole life there by the beach , and that he would rather die there than run .
so if you want to save a village , you do it with a good road , or with a good cell phone connection , and ideally some grid electrical power .
we look around the media , as we see on the news from iraq , afghanistan , sierra leone , and the conflict seems incomprehensible to us .
( laughter ) so even with that caveat , i knew that someone would buy the naming rights .
okay . three stories . here &apos;s the argument .
another new vocabulary word for the brave new world : this is the word &quot; &quot; flupsy &quot; &quot; — it &apos;s short for &quot; &quot; floating upwelling system . &quot; &quot; and this glorious , readily available device is basically a floating raft with an oyster nursery below .
if you &apos;re in india , it &apos;s either muslims or adivasis , our tribals , the naxalites .
these early wasps gave rise to the bees and the ants that have covered the world and changed the biosphere .
now , more europe for me is not simply giving more power to brussels .
when i stood up to speak to my people about god and the tsunami , i had no answers to offer them .
i mean , it &apos;s a hobby of mine that i &apos;ve been indulging in for the last few years , and it all started out with this picture of the american artist , donald baechler i had hanging at home . i had to look at it every day and after a while i just couldn &apos;t stand the mess anymore this guy was looking at all day long .
and he points it at me and gives the moon a break .
the next video is not done by us .
marine organisms do not care about international boundaries ; they move where they will .
all that pink chalky candy has moved to the front of the building and is now being picked into a lot of orders in those pick stations .
so i didn &apos;t have to do any of the cocontracting and all that .
so , looking for answers , i went to catholic mass .
okay . so i &apos;m smiling .
and it has this constant voiceover narrative in your stream of conscious thinking .
remember that we scanned both brains at the same time , so we can ask about time-synced activity in similar or different areas simultaneously , just like if you wanted to study a conversation and you were scanning two people talking to each other and you &apos;d expect common activity in language regions when they &apos;re actually kind of listening and communicating .
and that would be very interesting in the developing world .
we c.t.-scanned all of our bones and built a digital spinosaurus skeleton .
we need — when procurement , supply chain , manufacturing don &apos;t cooperate we need more stock , more inventories , more working capital .
because the killer apps can be downloaded .
what makes us human is that , of all these things that our minds and their minds have , we are the most extreme .
and doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients , but now this will change .
is there a way we can show people food in a way they have not seen it before ?
every storm is different now . &quot; &quot; so , the same extra heat pulls the soil moisture out of the ground and causes these deeper , longer , more pervasive droughts and many of them are underway right now .
that &apos;s the twelfth one .
and this is continuing and continuing and continuing .
and four , a global recession that has fundamentally shocked consumer behaviors .
if we do not lift up the women who played critical roles in these struggles , we fail to offer up role models to future generations .
and that &apos;s a new kind of leadership for me .
between 1966 and 1990 , the u.s. and soviet interests fought for control over my country .
one percent check the box . the rest do nothing .
and finally , finally , they &apos;ve managed to put instant messaging on their computers at work .
but right now we don &apos;t have enough of that .
what now fits in our pockets would fit in a blood cell in 25 years .
young people living in kibera in their community , with simple handheld devices , gps handheld devices and sms-enabled mobile phones , have literally put themselves on the map .
mars is not our sister planet .
as i found , if you really want to know a people , you start by looking inside their bedrooms .
if you learn to code , you can code to learn .
&quot; a smile is a door that is half open and half closed , &quot; the author jennifer egan wrote .
but there &apos;s an important thing to remember here : even though companies pushed back , even though companies demanded , hey , let &apos;s do this through a warrant process , let &apos;s do this where we actually have some sort of legal review , some sort of basis for handing over these users &apos; data , we saw stories in the washington post last year that weren &apos;t as well reported as the prism story that said the nsa broke in to the data center communications between google to itself and yahoo to itself .
( laughter ) but actually , the most impressive thing to me is that — well , actually , i would also like to say this for all children is to say thank you to all adults , for actually caring for us a lot , and to make our future world much better .
so , where do we go from here ?
so one has got to discover a certain wholeness .
now , the final piece of this , the take-home message from a working memory capacity standpoint is this : what we process , we learn .
he missed .
we had a global bubble .
so you can think about how unstable that would be .
dean koontz built this fabulous home theater , which is — i don &apos;t think accidentally — in art deco style .
an extremely important part of this project was about how i photograph these extraordinary people .
the term &quot; &quot; manipulative , &quot; &quot; often charged against women in a derogatory way , reflects a reality in which women have often had to find ways other than direct confrontation to achieve their goals .
and who &apos;s to say that they &apos;re wrong ?
you sit there , ok .
and i think it &apos;s no accident that we think this way .
( laughter ) fg : you &apos;ve all heard the frank lloyd wright story , when the woman called and said , &quot; &quot; mr. wright , i &apos;m sitting on the couch and the water &apos;s pouring in on my head . &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; madam , move your chair . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so , some years later i was doing a building , a little house on the beach for norton simon , and his secretary , who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady , called me and said , &quot; &quot; mr. simon &apos;s sitting at his desk and the water &apos;s coming in on his head . &quot; &quot; and i told her the frank lloyd wright story .
and torture &apos;s a terrible enough thing as it is , but when it &apos;s done by your hero , that just breaks you in so many ways .
they fought for their rights for over two centuries , and maybe because they sacrifice other minorities , hispanic , asian , we would suffer more in the mainstream .
its origins are located in russia .
&quot; parting thought : when there &apos;s bigger and better errors , we &apos;ll have them . &quot;
and we &apos;ve already started construction on section two .
but dragonflies are not the only creatures that make the crossing .
well , from there , unfortunately , in 2004 , the project came to a halt . many political reasons .
now if you put these ideas together , the third idea is that we essentially give these robots mathematical descriptions of the shape they need to execute .
and this is a hundred-year-old toy .
you see the tragedy in south africa there .
jogging , which is commonplace , and widely accepted as good for you , is solemn .
and your eye doesn &apos;t know which level to read .
and let me just summarize . so the bottom line : the brain processes information using 100,000 times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have .
but they were not teaching .
we &apos;re collecting and creating all kinds of data about how we &apos;re living our lives , and it &apos;s enabling us to tell some amazing stories .
( laughter ) and people scream .
it helps to have good friends .
next , consider making your business carbon-neutral .
but if another language can think that thought , then , by cooperating , we can achieve and learn so much more .
and i got to tell you , i think that was a huge error .
and when someone wants to rent a room , they go onto the blockchain database and all the criteria , they sift through , it helps them find the right room , and then the blockchain helps with the contracting , it identifies the party , it handles the payments just through digital payments — they &apos;re built into the system .
and so people jumped on board , and not just in los angeles but across the country .
of course there are mysteries , but a mystery is a mystery .
and they are our responsibility .
i think in absolute terms , last year we earned about 20-odd million dollars , spent about 13 million , with over a 40 percent ebita .
and i &apos;m a very nerdy doctor , so i read all of the studies that i could on this drug . i read the one study that was published that showed that reboxetine was better than placebo , and i read the other three studies that were published that showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other antidepressant , and because this patient hadn &apos;t done well on those other antidepressants , i thought , well , reboxetine is just as good . it &apos;s one to try .
why is it a disease of the aged ?
let &apos;s look at a couple of quick examples .
but how is it that we can start to think about using choreographic thinking , kinesthetic intelligence , to arm the ways in which we think about things more generally ?
i can &apos;t go through all of them , but i &apos;ll give you an example .
mg : yeah , i &apos;ve had a lot of women say to me , &quot; &quot; i really don &apos;t think i could work with my husband .
the first thing , i got out of jail , of course after i took a shower , i went online , i opened my twitter account and my facebook page , and i &apos;ve been always very respectful to those people who are opining to me .
and if our sun has planets — mercury , venus , earth , mars , etc . , surely those other stars should have planets also , and they do .
i figure about half of that are men , so that takes the number down to 750,000 .
but we do provide on that website a standardized list of definitions , because it &apos;s hard to attack a behavior in the right way if we &apos;re not all sharing a definition of what that behavior is .
&quot; that &apos;s right , &quot; it said , &quot; i am youtube . &quot;
and the marrow miner , the way it works is shown here .
he &apos;s still waiting for his funeral in norway , and none of his family will be able to attend .
one of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet .
so get peacekeepers there , but get them home as soon as possible .
and the collective has enabled me to form collaborations with a whole array of interesting people .
so i made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life , and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse — the subject of martyrdom , the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection of love of god , faith , but violence and crime and cruelty .
impressive . thank you .
pew research polls chinese public attitudes , and here are the numbers in recent years .
and my intention was to go out to the gyre , raise awareness about this issue and begin to pick up the plastic , chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks that could potentially be used as building materials in underdeveloped communities .
and a small group of thoughtful people changed that bay .
we are going to need a new generation of citizen leaders willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning as rapidly as possible .
now we &apos;re talking scale .
my mother &apos;s mother left europe in a hurry without her husband , but with her three-year-old daughter and diamonds sewn into the hem of her skirt .
and in fact , there &apos;s a thriving market in the partially eaten food of beloved people .
this is a new device that is essentially doing that .
if we can install these molecules in neurons somehow , then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light .
that &apos;s my simple proposition to you , my simple plea to every decision-maker in this room , everybody out there .
we asked ourselves simply : can design help rebuild trust ?
and it just disturbed me so much .
you see these cars that drive up — usually it &apos;s saabs and audis and volvos , because in certain neighborhoods it &apos;s socially acceptable to have a luxury car , so long as it comes from a country hostile to u.s. foreign policy — that &apos;s fine .
so i started thinking about peace , and i was obviously , as i said to you , very much moved by these images , trying to make sense of that .
and i feel that we have a special connection , which i value very much .
i spent ages flying this flight simulator , and i honestly believed i could fly airplanes by the end of it .
because gps doesn &apos;t work under water . that &apos;s why we need these tools .
and the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on .
and what we can do with our biology is going to shape our future and that of our children and that of their children — whether we gain control over aging , whether we learn to protect ourselves from alzheimer &apos;s , and heart disease , and cancer .
it &apos;s basically a little health care screening tool that we developed .
ataturk was a lateral thinker .
through his eyes , we knew when he needed to hear again , &quot; &quot; it is all set , jim . we &apos;re going to take care of shirley right here at the ranch , and acr &apos;s going to take care of your wildlife forever . &quot; &quot; from this experience i &apos;m going to share five practices .
my mother and father had been saving money for years to be able to buy that machine , and the first day it was going to be used , even grandma was invited to see the machine .
in fact , it &apos;s continued to increase .
my name is ani , and i &apos;m a designer and researcher at mit media lab , where i &apos;m part of a relatively new and unique group called design fiction , where we &apos;re wedged somewhere between science fiction and science fact .
but growing up as a child with the books around everywhere , with people to talk to about those books , this wasn &apos;t a sort of slightly learned thing .
they were living on top of the workshops where they were working .
and to get there , we have to change our workplaces , our policies and our culture .
this is not sustainable .
now the other thing is , we don &apos;t really know that much about how to make a particular thing happen by changing particular spots in the genome .
example number two : wikipedia .
what is love ?
now , of course , just like life , soap operas do ultimately meet the big finale .
what we noticed is when the bacteria were alone , so when they were in dilute suspension , they made no light .
but they can often reveal themselves negatively , in the form of jealousy .
history is not linear .
show the kids what bad customers or bad employees look like .
and we wanted to try and encourage people to use energy better .
then it deserves protection .
around here , no ? the redwood forests are gone .
so here we are in one part of the world — a time of joy , excitement , dreaming of the future of that child — while in another world , parents are filled with dread , not daring to dream of a future for their child beyond a few precious weeks .
so there are many other details like this .
equally startling , from my point of view , is the fact that no one was drawing any connections between what is happening to the body politic , and what is happening in our leading educational institutions .
they choose very carefully who they connect with .
it also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm , or their farm to a town , or from a town to a city .
so , i thought , could we have darius serve as our babycam carrier , and that way get the inputs that we feed into dylan ?
i was in congo in february , dancing and celebrating with women who &apos;ve survived the destruction of their selves in literally unthinkable ways — destroyed because other brutalized , psychopathic selves all over that beautiful land are fueling our selves &apos; addiction to ipods , pads , and bling , which further disconnect ourselves from ever feeling their pain , their suffering , their death .
because food is one issue that cannot be solved person by person , nation by nation .
well , when we look out , you and i , over that canopy of the intact primary forest , what we see is this enormous carpet of carbon .
she pointed out that the &quot; &quot; control men &quot; &quot; — as she called them — who carpet-bombed towns and fields with toxic insecticides like ddt , were only trying to kill the little stuff , the insects , not the birds .
i think these are so commonplace , they &apos;ve become clichés of our society .
with gravitational waves , we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning .
you have to trust me . take it on faith . &quot; &quot; well , i &apos;m sorry , people , but we are back to the pre-enlightenment church , and we need to fight against that .
this is based on the number of hosts .
and you can &apos;t tell the story about pollinators — bees , bats , hummingbirds , butterflies — without telling the story about the invention of flowers and how they co-evolved over 50 million years .
now we don &apos;t know if it says hollywood , or even bollywood for that matter .
and i also want to share this one .
solidifying into surface , molded by fire .
the doctor , medical team from university of miami arrived at five in the morning .
do you want to view the pandemic threat the way back in the 1950s people viewed the civil defense issue , and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu ?
they are sold in the name of forced labor , camel jockeying , anything , everything .
now , what you can see here is essentially a sugar molecule that was added a small little tag that is signaling to us outside of the body , &quot; hey , i &apos;m here . &quot;
( applause ) in 1949 we saw the emergence of the modern china in a way which surprised the world .
but we call each reading an emotion data point , and then they can fire together to portray different emotions .
how about underground with a view ?
were we to be able to identify this condition at an earlier point , and intervene and treat — i can tell you , this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past 10 years , this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition .
one brooklyn paper called this bike lane that we have on prospect park west &quot; &quot; the most contested piece of land outside of the gaza strip . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and this is what we had done .
ten years ago , when i was on an airplane and i introduced myself to my seatmate , and told them what i did , they &apos;d move away from me , because , quite rightly , they were saying psychology is about finding what &apos;s wrong with you .
and you know , i saw all the visions of the first couple of sessions .
but so too can our mind .
it &apos;s really difficult .
now this is a little bit of a dangerous metaphor , because of course we all know that inside of the trojan horse were a bunch of people with spears .
so we find this penny kind of fossilized in the floor , and we think that a very wealthy man must have left it there because regular people don &apos;t just lose money .
it &apos;s really just a pressure sensor like the kind that &apos;s in a doorbell .
and i suddenly thought , most deaf children are born to hearing parents .
so in the volume of the ocean , we will know , not just the physics and the chemistry , but the base of the food chain will be transparent to us with data on a continuous basis .
and even if they sometimes do nothing at all .
what was common to us all 40 years ago — the telling of stories between generations — is now rarified .
it &apos;s a very , very simple example , an easily stated question in probability , which every — you &apos;re in good company — everybody gets wrong .
( laughter ) and that was the 1950s .
it &apos;s the outstanding collaborators who enjoy the long careers , because bringing out the best in others is how they found the best in themselves . &quot; &quot; and when i went to visit companies that are renowned for their ingenuity and creativity , i couldn &apos;t even see any superstars , because everybody there really mattered .
frequently , a strategy has to be rethought .
and finally , well , there are those who believe that corruption is unavoidable .
at that moment , they fired and shot off my fingers .
i feel ashamed .
as i witnessed my father &apos;s body being swallowed by fire , i sat by his funeral pyre and wrote .
see , that skylight goes down and becomes that one .
so , for example , stones .
because the thing about being autistic is , i had to learn social skills like being in a play .
wonder is honest , it &apos;s completely innocent .
let &apos;s focus on the conversations between our friends and our family and our coworkers and our loved ones .
he goes , &quot; &quot; hey , mister ! mister ! &quot; &quot; and i looked at him — he didn &apos;t know any other english than that , but we didn &apos;t need english , no , no , no , no , no .
one day you &apos;re living your ordinary life , you &apos;re planning to go to a party , you &apos;re taking your children to school , you &apos;re making a dentist appointment .
i work in some of the most extreme cave environments on the planet .
so if i understood the chemistry of trustworthiness , i might help alleviate poverty .
metaphor is not just the detection of patterns ; it is the creation of patterns .
if they &apos;re new books and you can just , you know , butcher them , because you could just buy another one , that &apos;s not such a big deal in terms of doing high-quality scanning .
we started looking for funding , but instead , we just ran into questions , like , how many houses are you going to paint ?
so to me , there are no sudanese problems or south african problems or kenyan problems , only african problems because eventually , we share the turmoil .
such understated power here , in these tottering dancers who exert stupendous effort on tasks most view as insignificant .
he painted the walls and he painted the machine , and he got the operators retrained by people who know kids , like children &apos;s museum people .
so i finished , and it was a success in a sense .
and the people who were highly trusted 20 years ago are still rather highly trusted : judges , nurses .
too often , we receive information from journalists but we forget how that information was given .
i mean , i can use profane words like &quot; &quot; shit &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; piss , &quot; &quot; and then my grandma won &apos;t watch the video .
and it &apos;s a sort of a working computer . and when i built this computer , i had a moment of — what is it called ? — the epiphany where i realized that the computer &apos;s just so fast .
this is a drug called tamiflu . tamiflu is a drug which governments around the world have spent billions and billions of dollars on stockpiling , and we &apos;ve stockpiled tamiflu in panic , in the belief that it will reduce the rate of complications of influenza .
and it hurts your throat .
we &apos;re being critical of the west , the perception of the west about our identity — about the image that is constructed about us , about our women , about our politics , about our religion .
that &apos;s shown in what i consider to be the most scary economic statistic of our time .
it evokes the container metaphor of communication , in which we conceive of ideas as objects , sentences as containers , and communication as a kind of sending .
one idea is that our three-dimensional universe may be embedded in a high-dimensional space , just as you can imagine on these sheets of paper .
it has a very large , thick atmosphere , and in fact , its surface environment was believed to be more like the environment we have here on the earth , or at least had in the past , than any other body in the solar system .
so that &apos;s as wide as we look at stories .
and then eventually , of course , they all did .
( laughter ) and this dot comes from that number .
so we want things that nest , we want things that stack , and we want it digitized .
the music was in some ways different , but in structure and form , very much the same .
we can &apos;t scale .
i actually don &apos;t buy this gloomy narrative , and i don &apos;t think you should either .
ynh : again , it &apos;s not a prophecy ; it &apos;s seeing all kinds of possibilities before us .
&quot; &quot; achilles was a man who could shape history , a man of destiny , and this is what you should be , alexander . &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what he heard .
now i never really asked my grandparents for anything .
i mean , how hard can it be ?
please enjoy .
and we had no clue where it was .
and bed nets have an effect on the epidemic , but you &apos;re never going to make it extinct with bed nets .
can we get complex 3d structure automatically assembling in inorganic systems ?
we didn &apos;t start out thinking that we were going to need mars watches .
humanity can finally learn from the information that it can collect , as part of our timeless quest to understand the world and our place in it , and that &apos;s why big data is a big deal .
( applause ) and this is what we discovered .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t also destroy it .
god no , it was therapy .
what have i heard during these last four days ?
( laughter ) i said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ll tell you what . i &apos;ll build you an arm that &apos;s under nine pounds that has all that capability in one year .
one of the dwarfs i got to know was a guy named clinton brown .
they were waiting to see what would happen , didn &apos;t trust insurance companies , or thought , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve managed for so many years .
gunpowder , cannon .
and it &apos;s speculated that some of their interest in the arts was designed to counter soviet communism and promote what it considered to be pro-american thoughts and aesthetics .
and these four groups are just the ants outside the nest .
i just spent all this time buying this product and now i have to charge before use .
indra saw the woman , a sekhri .
and i partnered with the school nutrition association , and did you know that a little over 30 million kids participate in school lunch programs every day .
bj : but when this little cub saw that i had vacated my seat and climbed to the back to get some camera gear , she came in like a curious cat to come and investigate .
here , craig is working the head .
and i think , as a conceptual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling , that makes it not much use .
or as my friend descartes might put it , we think , therefore we are .
they &apos;re places where we keep objects of great value to us , where we simply treasure them for them being themselves .
more fascinating , you have other countries — south africa , mauritius , namibia — all in single digits .
tk : all right . so that &apos;s exciting on where we may go with the better mechatronics , if we make them good enough to put out on the market and use in a field trial .
so , with all that information , the big question is — what do we actually — what does she tell us ?
it &apos;s about saving lives . how cool is that ?
those , then , are the ways in which older people are useful in traditional societies .
i hope you &apos;ll help us make this wish come true .
i know that as a scientist , i have information and as a human being , i can communicate with anybody , inside or outside of academia .
it started earth day .
that is your itinerary , you will probably travel 53,000 kilometers , visit around , i think , 46 institutions , and just fyi , you might release 10 tons of co2 emissions .
and depending on who you ask , the surge was supposed to push it up even further .
but i had a problem . once i had all these machines , i was spending too much time teaching students to use them .
and let me try to help you understand their perspective .
i didn &apos;t know what the rules were , i &apos;m a natural born scientist , i guess , or some kind of a throwback to the 17th century , whatever .
and this is actually what it looks like , hundreds of blood vessels , all growing toward the center of the wound .
i love pun and the relation to the unconscious .
what you find is that people are good at telling the difference between real and posed laughter .
and it was like holding onto a thousand horses .
it &apos;s very interesting . when we started our school the parents would give thumbprints in the attendance register .
the political vision of a terrorist organization is decided by the leadership , which , generally , is never more than five to seven people .
none of it in our textbooks . none of this in our textbooks .
is it metabolized in the liver ?
and how do we grow things like food that grew up on earth like us ?
read the license .
giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem .
the only abrupt worldwide change would have been major asteroid impacts or volcanic super-eruptions .
we went to africa , sudan , sierra leone , liberia , kenya .
&quot; why does she want to meet us ? &quot;
as i began to think about stories like this and hear about stories like this , i began to ask myself and imagine : is there an alternative ?
now , these suppliers were our big companies .
what you &apos;re looking at is a phone looking at one after another picture of a bird , and actually not only saying , &quot; &quot; yes , it &apos;s a bird , &quot; &quot; but identifying the species of bird with a network of this sort .
and i think this starts with probably your physical body and fitness more than anything , because we can control that .
so why is high blood pressure so differentially deadly for black men ?
first of all , you know , for a long time computer games meant things like &quot; &quot; doom , &quot; &quot; where you &apos;re going around shooting things , very violent games , very fast , aimed at teenage boys . right ? that &apos;s who plays computer games .
he didn &apos;t read a note , and he was profoundly hearing impaired .
but let &apos;s think for a moment about jarrett &apos;s initial instinct .
so now — ( applause ) thank you .
same thing with laysan albatross who travel an entire ocean on a trip sometimes , up to the same zone the tunas use .
the benefits of doing so are enormous , the risks minimal .
it &apos;s made of asphalt , and asphalt is a very nice material to drive on , but not always , especially not on these days as today , when it &apos;s raining a lot .
so like in tennis , usually it &apos;s win-lose ; it always adds up to zero-zero-sum . but if you &apos;re playing doubles , the person on your side of the net , they &apos;re in the same boat as you , so you &apos;re playing a non-zero-sum game with them .
in the classroom , we have arguments on some of the most fiercely held moral convictions that students have about big public questions .
and so , what you &apos;ve seen today is less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here , and in the ted lab , we have a tour that was created by a six-year-old named benjamin that will knock your socks off . ( laughter ) so we &apos;ll see you there . thank you .
on the other hand , we now can understand how old the universe is .
it must be like that for kyu doing things with musicians — it &apos;s similar to that i would imagine — where you ... huh ?
and given the state of the world today , there &apos;s really no other option .
this particular reel — it &apos;s an industrial video — but it was shown in drive-in theaters in 1961 — in the detroit area , in fact — and it preceded alfred hitchcock &apos;s &quot; &quot; psycho . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so i like to think there was something going on there of the new generation of makers coming out of this , plus &quot; &quot; psycho . &quot; &quot; this is andrew archer .
it &apos;s perceived to be part of an elite agenda rather than something that benefits all .
to see what &apos;s going to happen , you can &apos;t just look at the workforce that is now , you have to look at our future workforce .
do you recall when i showed you these puzzle pieces ?
and i &apos;m not sure what the best way to organize the whole thing is .
you hurry , you get where you &apos;re going , but you get there alone .
the second , more honest way is to actually fix the model .
the negatives are gone .
( applause ) bruno giussani : mark , mark , come back . ( applause )
i think it gives an understanding of how we &apos;re picking out movement from what dan &apos;s doing , but i think it will also show you , if you look at that movement , that when dan makes music , his motions are very purposeful , very precise , very disciplined and they &apos;re also very beautiful .
and this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein is going to fold .
and sometimes that can be different amounts over different times or with different people or on different days .
it says , &quot; &quot; just knowing i can call you at four in the morning if i need to makes me not really need to , &quot; &quot; which i love , because together these are like , &quot; &quot; hallmark : when you care enough to send the very best twice , phrased slightly differently . &quot; &quot; i was not surprised at the tedster and new yorker magazine overlap .
why can &apos;t we ? why can &apos;t humans regenerate ?
take the fatihah , the seven-verse opening chapter that is the lord &apos;s prayer and the shema yisrael of islam combined .
central among them , a commitment to exclusively peaceful means .
we did it so fast we weren &apos;t prepared for their collapse .
take this tiger , for example .
and it &apos;s worth probably about three macbook pros .
or perhaps i should say , more accurately , señor pringle .
the seer of clouds had to take account of it .
i expect to live 100 years .
and it turns out that both human and other brains cost about the same , an average of six calories per billion neurons per day .
but wagner made an innovation .
violence can be stopped .
two days after , i was transferred to another place .
fred sexton was a friend of this guy , george hodel .
well , you have to find someone who is willing to be a surrogate .
so you photograph that in exactly the same position , and then you can substitute in — and that part does use photoshop — just the edges .
just then , with a loud bang , the heavens opened . ( claps ) and the god indra jumped into the clearing .
you can also see the evolution of the one-child-only policy as it travels through the bloodline .
we closed broadway from 42nd street to 47th street and created two and a half acres of new pedestrian space .
tori rebuilt the american pearl , and in december of 1999 , she did it .
let &apos;s say that if the physics of fusion is encoded into the universe , maybe the physics of life is as well .
and because nothing is more important to us than survival , the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe called the amygdala .
he even once traded a work of art for a block of government cheese because the person wanted it so badly .
again , it &apos;s kind of coming out of nowhere ; it &apos;s a little hard to use right now .
( applause ) okay . the point is it &apos;s really hard to tell , isn &apos;t it ? it &apos;s incredible , we looked at students do this and they couldn &apos;t tell .
governments don &apos;t naturally pick these things in the right way .
there are charts which show all these movements of information . that density of information is amazing .
this led me to starting a company called design within reach , a company dealing with simple forms , making good designers available to us , and also selling the personalities and character of the designers as well , and it seems to have worked .
you know .
coral reefs are chemists .
she talks with the women and explains that the land is barren because they have cut and sold the trees .
we stayed in old , crumbling , walled cities , in tiny little hotels , and we would climb up to the roof and drink vinho verde and watch the sun set and play checkers .
so i was thinking how i could explain myself better about how big and enormous this code is .
it &apos;s about an m.p. called geoffrey dickens .
and they made their own comics , starring the cartoon lunch lady alongside their actual lunch ladies .
now let &apos;s add a mycorrhiza plant into the diagram i used earlier .
we all know that as we form thoughts , they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains .
so it seems right .
and my job is to look at lots of different species of animals and try to figure out how their tissues and organs work when everything &apos;s going right , rather than trying to figure out how to fix things when they go wrong , like so many of you .
and this gets us back to the mushrooms .
and you then feel you must act .
and what it is — it &apos;s a twist on health .
and not just us . it &apos;s also kids .
will it be under $ 20 ?
our collective vision at naya jeevan , which for many of you , as you all recognize , means &quot; &quot; new life &quot; &quot; in urdu and hindi , is to rejuvenate the lives of millions of low income families by providing them with affordable access to catastrophic health care .
right ? so these guys are kind of the hungry and foolish and colorful guys , right ?
because the zetas organization was founded in treason , they lost some of the linkages to the production and distribution in the most profitable markets like cocaine , but what they did have , and this is again based on their military origin , was a perfectly structured chain of command with a very clear hierarchy and a very clear promotion path that allowed them to supervise and operate across many , many markets very effectively , which is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do .
and they did this by painstaking observations of numerous distant galaxies , allowing them to chart how the expansion rate has changed over time .
i have given the slide show that i gave here two years ago about 2,000 times .
jodi lomask , and her wonderful troupe capacitor , joined me in the canopy in my rainforest site in costa rica .
we &apos;ve literally consumed an entire river in north america for irrigation .
and yet when i think of the poverty of society which doesn &apos;t give freedom to its people , i don &apos;t admire those buildings .
my personality was entombed within a seemingly silent body , a vibrant mind hidden in plain sight within a chrysalis .
voice 1 : you &apos;ll have to stay here in the safe house until we get word the terrorist threat is over .
now that i know it &apos;s a photograph , i &apos;ve got dozens of other binary translation techniques to visualize and understand that information , so in a matter of seconds , we can take this information , shove it through a dozen other visual translation techniques in order to find out exactly what we were looking at .
it &apos;s the first working prototype of the clock .
and whenever we discuss one of these problems that we have to address — child labor in cottonseed farms in india — this year we will monitor 50,000 cottonseed farms in india .
and technology was going to carry us along .
and it was in this , preliminary to these pieces of furniture , that ricky and i worked on furniture by the slice .
the other way is to change the type of food .
it &apos;s bigger than the difference between the microbes in this reef and the microbes in this prairie .
and he took lithium , and he went down the line .
auke ijspeert : absolutely . so the robot — we have some spin-off projects where we would like to use the robots to do search and rescue inspection , so this robot is now seeing you .
we regarded each other , scrutinized one another .
i &apos;m going to start by asking you a question : is anyone familiar with the blue algae problem ?
the first thing you will notice on signing up to one of these sites is how familiar it looks .
i study ants in the desert , in the tropical forest and in my kitchen , and in the hills around silicon valley where i live .
have you ever hoped that there was some ability you hadn &apos;t discovered yet that you were just naturally great at ?
have you ever eaten a booger long past your childhood ?
this is not a wardrobe malfunction . i have to take my belt off here .
that &apos;s actually not true .
by coincidence , as lorna and judith worked behind the scenes to reform the criteria , people all over the world were seeing an autistic adult for the first time .
this may seem minor , but it is terrifying to hear rumor after rumor after rumor that another tidal wave , bigger than the last , will be coming at exactly 1 p.m. , or perhaps tonight , or perhaps ...
and i could spend hours talking about them , because they &apos;re all kind of heroes .
in that same year , i &apos;ve found out , only 20 % of people had used these surgery-bank checks .
we had the journalist &#91; heather &#93; brooke speaking about her battle against government corruption , and she introduced me to this website , alaveteli.com.
i mean it &apos;s , &quot; &quot; i have my friends , therefore i am . &quot; &quot; lt : ( laughter ) jf : no , it &apos;s true .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve noticed , but there &apos;s been a spate of books that have come out lately contemplating or speculating on the cognition and emotional life of dogs .
on the other hand , if you &apos;re visiting an underdeveloped country , and 25 dollars buys you a gourmet meal , it &apos;s exorbitant for a big mac .
2005 , anthony fitzherbert , an agricultural engineer , could travel through helmand , could stay in nad ali , sangin and ghoresh , which are now the names of villages where fighting is taking place .
and i was on fire — excruciating , excruciating pain .
tom &apos;s hand . tom &apos;s hand . tom &apos;s hand . ( laughter ) anyway .
what if we zoomed out and actually tried to experience our own cultural big bang ?
some people have called a cyberwar what may actually be just a spy operation — and obviously , a quite mishandled one .
we proposed a building that was audacious , that was different than any of the forms that the community was used to , and we were scared and our client was scared and the community was scared , so we created a series of photorealistic renderings that we put onto facebook and we put onto instagram , and we let people start to do what they do : share it , comment , like it , hate it .
we live in one world .
on the right-hand side , &#91; 0,0 &#93; input is a 1 output , which goes up .
recently , i showed this to my students , and i just asked them to try and explain why it happened .
another example , this was completely packed with houses , and then we built this , what we call , a knowledge square .
so , there &apos;s another picture . here , this one . i really do like this picture .
he showed him , &quot; &quot; you know , we don &apos;t have to do this wrong .
the last time you were in the presence of a baby — this happens to be my granddaughter , mitra .
and if you pick up one of those magazines , it &apos;s hard to resist , isn &apos;t it ?
with tania singer at the max planck institute of leipzig , we showed that the brain networks for empathy and loving-kindness are different .
i was thinking , i &apos;m mutilated ? i &apos;m a mutilated person .
you can be a general , a politician , an economist who is depressed , a musician in a minor key , a painter in dark colors .
and then we introduce them to somebody who they come to hate immediately , the drill sergeant .
yes , we built our first satellite prototype in our garage .
the reason why we forgot that is because the times in history when architecture did the most to transform society were those times when , actually , the one percent would build on behalf of the 99 percent , for various different reasons , whether that was through philanthropy in the 19th century , communism in the early 20th , the welfare state , and most recently , of course , through this inflated real estate bubble .
but the one thing they didn &apos;t capture was making love .
and so what i want to do with you in , oh god , only 10 minutes , is to really think again this juxtaposition , because it actually has massive , massive implications beyond innovation policy , which just happens to be the area that i often talk with with policymakers .
you put it in your search engine , and you create the drug to treat the threat .
i &apos;m going to share with you some of the exciting work that &apos;s going on .
powered by the massive data from imagenet and the modern cpus and gpus to train such a humongous model , the convolutional neural network blossomed in a way that no one expected .
this is a korean church that we did in queens .
and for me , the man of steel , christopher reeve , has best raised the awareness on the distress of spinal cord injured people .
these animals , they were being demonized .
now comedy travels along a distinct wavelength from other forms of language .
and he says , &quot; &quot; i want my cheese sandwich . &quot; &quot; and he takes this one .
but this conclusion would ignore a tectonic shift taking place in egypt far from the cameras in tahrir square .
but my spirit is strong as ever .
and so , those two individuals have different numbers of friends .
and just now in england they had a cold spell .
we are now the major agent of impact on our earth .
i was all set to be a diplomat , teacher , doctor — all laid out .
allow me to try to answer this question in the few coming minutes .
you can see a timeline , showing you the exciting moments throughout the story .
that narrative of gratitude runs through a lot of the stories i hear .
he said in his lifetime he had climbed a great mountain , the mountain of challenging and then defeating racial oppression and defeating apartheid .
so this behavior of risk avoidance is a very old evolutionary response .
well in surgery , you couldn &apos;t have people who are more specialized and you couldn &apos;t have people who are better trained .
if you just run the simulation , it will just collapse , like this .
and this is the ability to program physical and biological materials to change shape , change properties and even compute outside of silicon-based matter .
i remember one particularly low moment .
and the maps of violence in most u.s. cities looked like this .
they are not meant to stay .
( laughter ) ( applause ) so we are natural-born dualists .
so what does play do for the brain ?
this has to be described as an adventure , not a burden .
alzheimer &apos;s disease : there &apos;s five million people affected , and you can check vital signs , activity , balance .
and you start to see things .
well , he told me .
( laughter ) allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame .
what will we know ? what will we learn ?
so why are screens so pervasive in our analog life ?
you should always use a condom , &quot; &quot; and yet , in her relationship , she &apos;s not empowered — what &apos;s going to happen ?
one can become an object of public ridicule because of a misplaced b.
it &apos;s not one of these statistics which is very doubtful .
you sell your products more expensively .
and the large companies , they typically have wonderful wellness programs , but the medium-sized companies that typically fall between the cracks on issues like this , they started to get engaged and used our program as a model for their own employees to try and have contests to see who might be able to deal with their obesity situation in a way that could be proactively beneficial to others .
we &apos;re going to learn how to make one flap .
i thought , &quot; &quot; oh gracious , if these two players , either one of them &quot; &quot; — they were different years , but i thought about each one at the time he was there — &quot; &quot; oh , if he ever makes the varsity , our varsity must be pretty miserable , if he &apos;s good enough to make it . &quot; &quot; and you know , one of them was a starting player for a season and a half .
so the train is now pulling into the third stop along the 6 line .
and another story of the cylinder begins .
you &apos;re seeing a plot .
as a scientist , i always wanted to measure that resonance , that sense of the other that happens so quickly , in the blink of an eye .
thinking , how can that be ? you &apos;re cheating . the lines are curved .
secondly , in the communist ideology , there &apos;s no place for criticism .
again , chiming with your view that china has a militarized regime ready to , you know , mobilize its enormous forces .
this is a spectacular coral garden .
all right . i understand . if you &apos;re unwilling to — all right , well , we can discuss that after class .
i was not a great student .
but because so many of the issues in education aren &apos;t just in school , they &apos;re in family and community , what you also need , definitely , is more on the right hand side .
imagine that that earth is at the center of the universe , and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere .
you are somebody who wants to make a difference .
but you also have to provide usable evidence that you are trustworthy .
five or less digits . so , if you &apos;re in the tens of thousands you &apos;ve got to sit down .
we worked like dogs down in the garment industry every single day .
i want us all to change the verb .
now , there &apos;s no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of brad superimposed over another actor &apos;s body .
( laughter ) but what about this day , this one particular friday ?
less than one day of exxon &apos;s revenues .
once we &apos;ve discovered somebody has low vision , the next big challenge is to work out why , and to be able to do that , we need to have access to the inside of the eye .
there are different programs for graduate students , for executives at different companies .
and i wonder what he &apos;s soaking in .
i particularly like the little linux penguin in the back . ( laughter ) so one of the things that that &apos;s leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion .
the first paradox is that growing up is about rejecting the past and then promptly reclaiming it .
to just bring them to justice . &quot; &quot; but of course , they don &apos;t listen .
i should be able to ask my house where my shoes are .
so like the periodic table , we came up with our own table of the elements : new lifeforms that were computationally grown , additively manufactured and biologically augmented .
here &apos;s the mr. it provides the framework .
the closer one gets , the more new features one discovers .
but there &apos;s also another problem from ships that i &apos;m illustrating here , and that &apos;s the problem of collision .
and to me this was a key component that somehow , through this medium of photography , which allows us to contemplate these landscapes , that i thought photography was perfectly suited to doing this type of work .
and there &apos;s a difference there too , because if we , you in the audience , or i , if we decide to have a designer baby , then their children will also be genetically modified , and so on , because it &apos;s heritable .
my head snapped back over my red seat .
that was designed on that machine , in the woods behind the institute .
what i want to do more generally is to get you thinking about the place of uncertainty and randomness and chance in our world , and how we react to that , and how well we do or don &apos;t think about it .
he was strong , steady , disciplined .
i found this one watering hole , and felt if everything remained the same way it was behaving , i had a real opportunity to capture something unique .
( laughter ) so i &apos;m sorry about that .
we &apos;re talking about energy .
it &apos;s fundamental to darwin and mendel and so on .
thank you very much indeed . ( applause )
our city is very spread out .
i &apos;m going to argue that , in fact , business strategy has always been premised on assumptions about technology , that those assumptions are changing , and , in fact , changing quite dramatically , and that therefore what that will drive us to is a different concept of what we mean by business strategy .
i &apos;m a corporate lawyer most of the time for an organization called enablis that supports entrepreneurs in south africa .
and that &apos;s a little image of the tree of stansted .
that all seems like win to me .
and i fell into those thousands of connections that i &apos;d made , and i asked my crowd to catch me .
there was no place to stay , so i stuck my computer in , i went away , came back after a couple of months , found kids playing games on it .
so , describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt . go ahead .
and it &apos;s a rare fungus .
principle number two : we have to recognize and celebrate diversity in this stuff .
however , huge supercomputer analyses , done of the likely effectiveness of this , show that it won &apos;t buy us much time at all .
what you &apos;ve done makes people laugh and then think .
and they know how to bring it back because they have demystified one big myth , which is the myth of spontaneity , which is that it &apos;s just going to fall from heaven while you &apos;re folding the laundry like a deus ex machina , and in fact they understood that whatever is going to just happen in a long-term relationship , already has .
so the idea is that we get the speed and efficiency benefits of using these physical dials together with the flexibility and versatility of a system that &apos;s designed in software .
so , there &apos;s plenty of non-zero-sumness .
should one of them stop working or reduce hours to be home ?
in other words , they mastered the art of doing more with less , which is the essence of frugal innovation .
left home .
so i think that actually step two , that i called a step a moment ago , isn &apos;t a step at all .
what am i doing this for ?
and a variety of other studies have shown that the microbial community that lives in and on us helps in development of the immune system , helps in fighting off pathogens , helps in our metabolism , and determining our metabolic rate , probably determines our odor , and may even shape our behavior in a variety of ways .
but unfortunately , he died prematurely in 1970 , and so he wasn &apos;t really able to live that dream completely .
it makes use of the gps — you &apos;re familiar with gps in your automobile , but you may not be familiar with the fact that there &apos;s a gps u.s. , there &apos;s a russian gps , and there &apos;s a new gps system going to europe , called galileo .
you know , that &apos;s not good enough .
it &apos;s even on thongs , but compressed to &quot; &quot; how about never — is never good for you ? &quot; &quot; now these look like very different forms of humor but actually they bear a great similarity .
they said , one , the bridge doesn &apos;t exist .
if you go on , that &apos;s a slightly more complicated program that &apos;s now doing all sorts of algorithmic things and creating user interface and so on .
so i sent a cold email to info @ equaljusticeintiative.org : &quot; &quot; dear bryan , &quot; &quot; it said , &quot; &quot; i think your building project is maybe the most important project we could do in america and could change the way we think about racial injustice .
ln : and at some point , she noticed something .
because to imitate a complex act requires my brain to adopt the other person &apos;s point of view .
thirteen species — highest diversity we can find in one single area in africa .
and one night , there &apos;s a knock at his hotel room door .
it was 11 : 50pm .
mm : it starts playing immediately .
they &apos;re ways in which we can have greater choice for refugees beyond those basic , impossible three options i explained to you and still leave others better off .
we find that if we get them out of institutions and into loving families early on , they recover their developmental delays , and go on to lead normal , happy lives .
is it something as obvious as that jealousy , which boils down into person , desire , impediment , is such a solid narrative foundation ?
the experts call this the girl effect .
and before we have the debate , i &apos;d like to actually take a show of hands — on balance , right now , are you for or against this ?
for every dollar given to a women &apos;s program , 20 dollars are given to men &apos;s programs .
and what have you always wanted to ask someone from the other side ?
when the terrorist incidents occurred in the united kingdom a couple of years ago , i think even though they didn &apos;t claim as many lives as we lost in the united states on 9 / 11 , i think the thing that troubled the british most was that the perpetrators were not invaders , but homegrown citizens whose religious and political identities were more important to them than the people they grew up with , went to school with , worked with , shared weekends with , shared meals with .
( laughter ) if you put it next to contemporary architecture , it feels totally natural to me .
so i just want to welcome all of you onto the ride .
and it was through crowd-sourcing , it was through the kindness that strangers were showing me , that i could uncover parts of my past that were haunting me .
i &apos;ve been at this for 30 years , and in that time i &apos;ve seen the ability , the commitment , the will of government to do this decline , and i don &apos;t see them making a comeback right now .
i lived with incredible birds , incredible animals , i swam in our small rivers with our caimans .
and we keep setting our expectations higher and higher .
so don &apos;t hang on till the bitter end .
deah and his wife yusor were a young married couple living in chapel hill , north carolina , where they both went to school .
but every generation has the chance to make it better .
and i &apos;m not going to take them somewhere and say , one day all of this will be yours .
they start at the surface of the brain , and then they dive down into the tissue itself , and as they spread out , they supply nutrients and oxygen to each and every cell in the brain .
what we want is to make sure that those individuals with autism can be free from the devastating consequences that come with it at times , the profound intellectual disabilities , the lack of language , the profound , profound isolation .
they &apos;ve bounded the city with a line .
the president of ethiopia said he would do it .
naghma lived in a refugee camp with her parents and her eight brothers and sisters .
ca : so that seems like a win for the consumer .
so my moment of truth did not come all at once .
this is a very nice pattern , and it &apos;s true , because 5 + 5 = 2 • 5 , etc .
but it also tells us something about policy .
so you &apos;ve got a lot of information . that &apos;s great .
now it &apos;s all done on my iphone , and it all goes straight up to my server , and my server does all the backend work and categorizes things and puts everything together .
they are the slaves .
and yet what we proved then is the u.s. has more market power than opec .
how do we get that to a million ?
and he wished me luck and he gave me some free books and he showed me out the door .
by that i mean , not just the choice to use a gene drive , but also the choice not to use one .
let me step back and take a look at why the city is so good for the blind .
that component is that we cannot be attached to outcome .
ca : wait , wait , wait , not doing anything ?
we can also magnify small mechanical movements , like vibrations in engines , that can help engineers detect and diagnose machinery problems , or see how our buildings and structures sway in the wind and react to forces .
i went to congo with msf , and contributed to a book and an exhibition that focused attention on a forgotten war in which millions of people have died , and exposure to disease without treatment is used as a weapon .
and none of this takes more money and none of this demands a bureaucracy , but it does demand that you think things differently and you are prepared to bend budgets and work programs in order to create that supportive framework that communities can bounce off .
except it &apos;s supposed to be brown .
here , instead of through the lens of a genome , through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record .
( laughter ) so , i couldn &apos;t let myself feel condescending towards these boys .
now , david builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab , but before he does that , he works with dancers to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place .
now , the best way of ending human suffering caused by war is to never go to war .
so let &apos;s start off by defining some terms .
you leave aside what is natural to be natural .
so when we went through the numbers , and just added that up — how much nuclear do we see china and india bringing online over the next 15 years , how much do we see at risk of being taken offline — this was the most startling finding .
few high schoolers had access to computers in those days .
and that is , of course , europe .
but of course , lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy .
in different contexts , cells do different things .
the life of a small-shareholder farmer is miserable .
and as you &apos;ll notice , it &apos;s still pretty gosh darn fast slowed down 333 times . it &apos;s an incredibly powerful movement .
in situations where you can &apos;t go about thinking how you &apos;d reverse this feeling of injustice , you can still think , maybe not what you can do , but what you can not do .
i blush whenever i show this .
so if this theory were true then it meant that light as it passed the sun should actually be bent around it .
some of that &apos;s good : oxfam , a great non-governmental actor .
and i have a volunteer subject in the audience today , julie .
and in fact , if you compare it to data , it fits very well with the development of cities and economies .
and this is an excerpt from my first editor &apos;s letter , where i say that rookie , we don &apos;t have all the answers , we &apos;re still figuring it out too , but the point is not to give girls the answers , and not even give them permission to find the answers themselves , but hopefully inspire them to understand that they can give themselves that permission , they can ask their own questions , find their own answers , all of that , and rookie , i think we &apos;ve been trying to make it a nice place for all of that to be figured out .
and experience is not just a kind of entertainment in a non-casual way .
and who &apos;s responsible ? designers .
and yamaha makes an incredible thing called the disklavier pro that looks like a nice grand piano there .
it can be deadly .
so whatever you get that can make you happy can go away .
it &apos;s a very frightening , very , very frightening thought .
it is the same in the 21st century . that &apos;s why i am going to decide to give this machine only for poor women across india .
i remember a journal article about this new question answering software that had a graph .
instead , she said , &quot; &quot; no , no . work and leisure can be together . &quot; &quot; yeah , that &apos;s particularly gorgeous — it &apos;s the tv dinner of 2001 .
it &apos;s out in the middle of the pacific , right around the equator .
so there was only one possibility — to bring the column out of the computer .
i hope when you learn things , like about how the natural world works — i just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper or you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child .
so cyber weapons are dangerous by nature , but in addition , they &apos;re emerging in a much more unstable environment .
and sneakerheads are the ones who drive the marketing and the hype and the pr and the brand cachet , and enable nike to sell millions of $ 60 sneakers .
well it so happens that we have a singular body .
the inventors don &apos;t know what the invention is .
this is the most disruptive technology — i &apos;ve been told by executives of the pesticide industry — that they have ever witnessed .
with the help of the family , they cross oceans , they cross deserts , they cross rivers , they cross mountains .
of my four-and-a-half-year commandship in that district , three years in , after putting pastors in the car with my police because i knew this — it &apos;s a little secret — i knew this : it was hard to stay a nasty police officer while you &apos;re riding around with a clergy .
now the first interface is called a drivegrip .
people &apos;s moral values , they &apos;re their most deeply held beliefs .
thank you .
so what happens if you start to explain space to them ?
here is a list of last year &apos;s graduates , graduated in june , and what they &apos;re currently doing — 48 of them .
now , sylvia browne is the big operator .
the conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold was able to learn .
i stay . if i go , i will be killed .
and by rating it and by rating the different people who submit information , we can get refined results and weighted results .
the cab stopped , and i pulled my body from it feeling each ounce of weight as i walked to the elevator .
and we think that this alignment is necessary for communication .
i was at the top of the general assembly just looking down into it and seeing it happen .
she looks at me like i &apos;m her , you know , her moron child , the cretin , the one she &apos;s got to speak to very slowly and distinctly .
and so that &apos;s what makes me lie awake at night , i guess , you know .
there are people now online that are friends ; they &apos;ve never met .
now i have carefully cropped this sequence to be exactly the duration of a human eye blink , so in the time that it would take you to blink your eye , the fly has seen this looming predator , estimated its position , initiated a motor pattern to fly it away , beating its wings at 220 times a second as it does so .
lots of people are used to having a spiritual tribe , or a church tribe , having a work tribe , having a community tribe .
if i zoom on it , you can see : that &apos;s the rover on the surface .
that &apos;s why i like what i do .
so that &apos;s one thing , to introduce the idea of doubt into graphics .
( dolphin noises ) you see , they &apos;re synchronizing with their partner as well as the other dyad .
beautiful , because it has symmetry .
this is a photograph taken about 100 years ago of my grandfather and great-grandfather .
i &apos;ll never forget that day back in the spring of 2006 .
i don &apos;t mean to be rude , but you know what a psychopath is .
he had installed the heavy equipment for his new process in an abandoned store in the vicinity of kings mountain , and for two months these 16 men would live and work together , mastering the new process .
in the words of the poet longfellow , &quot; the human voice is the organ of the soul . &quot;
( laughter ) every country is different and it &apos;s confusing , okay ?
and in the intervening years i had two daughters .
and now , brrrrrrrrrr , just like when you were a kid .
it was complex , but there was something capricious about its complexity .
but that doesn &apos;t mean we shouldn &apos;t do everything in our power to protect the environments that we rely and depend on , and like everest , the remote location and inadequate infrastructure of the orbital environment make waste disposal a challenging problem .
and that &apos;s also a higher hurdle . people drop out .
to the top right of the graph , are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well-being , but they &apos;re using a lot of planet to get there .
so the next time a victim of a privacy violation comes up to you , instead of blaming them , let &apos;s do this instead : let &apos;s shift our ideas about digital privacy , and let &apos;s respond with compassion .
but it &apos;s still true that a neuron , a nerve cell , looks the same in a crayfish , a bird or you .
he would promote the policeman immediately , so that p.c. bloggs became detective inspector bloggs in the course of the conversation and wave us on merrily .
let &apos;s see by a show of hands .
why don &apos;t we see more innovation in sanitation ?
but we can let that insecurity make us brittle or supple .
it &apos;s a simple choice , so we &apos;ve worked for many years with the forest stewardship council , with literally hundreds of other organizations , and there &apos;s a point here about collaboration .
first one : forbid installation on ground zero .
acinetobacter is a nasty hospital bug , and carbapenem is pretty much the strongest class of antibiotics that we can throw at this bug .
since i &apos;m home-schooled , i went to go hear him speak one day .
( to audience ) thank you , guys .
after treatment , the child gains significant functionality .
they had six million between them — and we beat them .
we used quantitative arteriography , showing the narrowing .
my measurements .
now , the rate is still too high — still too many people unnecessarily losing their lives .
shyness is about fear of social judgment .
so you ’ ve got that covered .
when i was a student at mit , we all shared one computer that took up a whole building .
and when they find them they pull them out and they pin them to the wall like butterflies .
for fashionistas , they want to stay ahead of the curve .
( video ) so you &apos;re me , and you &apos;re in math class yet again , because they make you go every single day .
it turns out that everyone &apos;s anecdotal experience out camping is actually true .
the devices are also biodegradable .
and as i &apos;ve shown here , we have the audience .
i didn &apos;t have to think about the notes .
we need now to adopt a new conception of agriculture .
so i said , have what , shall i translate the internet into some indian language ? that &apos;s not possible .
and here &apos;s an example .
the issue of privacy and personal data is much bigger than just the government , and so learn the facts .
when this happened to me 17 years ago , there was no name for it .
and when i have the question , it is a focus .
take a look at gabby .
the landscape has sadly become much more populated with instances like mine , whether or not someone actually make a mistake , and now it &apos;s for both public and private people .
so , the tiger is the icon .
and we have to resist to the changes .
and one of the first things that we discovered that i think is really helpful for understanding polarization is to understand that the political divide in our country is undergirded by a deeper moral divide .
and when the sun shines , you get copious quantities of these things , called neutrinos , pouring out .
crossing miles and miles of sastrugi — frozen ice snowdrifts that could be hip-deep .
but what you do know is that that introduction was nothing short of transformative .
one of my viewer &apos;s uncles died on a particular day and he chose to commemorate it with a piece of hate .
i &apos;ve met a lot of them .
if she is married to a man she doesn &apos;t like or if she is married to an old man , she has to accept , because she does not want to be dubbed as disobedient .
together you have changed the zeitgeist from analog to digital , and pushed the boundaries .
so i am convinced that if we can unlock the technologies that are commonplace in the richer world to be able to transform foods .
when the wildfires broke out in san diego , in october of 2007 , people turned to twitter to report what was happening and to find information from neighbors about what was happening around them .
it ain &apos;t okay . you know what ? it is not okay .
there &apos;s a whole gray market for lego , thousands of home-based businesses .
( laughter ) ( applause ) ( music ) sb : we ended up at what was advertised as the world &apos;s largest speed dating event .
so there is this key benefit that is relevant to state policy makers in terms of economic development .
the thing that caused massive policy changes to occur was race to the top for education .
and we learn and adapt the program accordingly .
and that was the job of the journalist . it was filtering all this stuff .
they are all remodeled . they all become specialized for the task at hand .
quite nice in itself , they &apos;re little , sort of , airplane things .
they were mostly reacting to my accent , that it is not normal for a narrator to have an accent .
in the u.k. we have an epidemic of facial injuries among young people .
thank you .
when you have a non-stick pan , it costs about , maybe , 250 rupees , five dollars , six dollars .
eighty-five to 95 percent of species at this time die out , and simultaneous to that is a huge , dramatic spike in carbon dioxide , that a lot of scientists agree comes from a simultaneous eruption of volcanoes and a runaway greenhouse effect .
it means that you can &apos;t get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so much .
is it a part of a circle ?
we feel awkward and shameful talking about it .
dp : when a guy is happily married , no matter what happens at work , no matter what happens in the rest of the day , there &apos;s a shelter when you get home , there &apos;s a knowledge knowing that you can hug somebody without them throwing you downstairs and saying , &quot; &quot; get your hands off me . &quot; &quot; being married is like having a color television set .
and there &apos;s all this crap sort of circling around it , dust and stuff .
but what if you had to drive four hours to charge your phone because you had no reliable source of electricity ?
he was talking about the space aliens .
one way to change our genes is to make new ones , as craig venter has so elegantly shown .
it can be in a basket . it can be in a loaf pan , but we pan it .
ca : but to make this happen , you have to look at each part in the chain — the police , who else ?
i also see a world where we can erase unwanted memories .
but it &apos;s also useful , because it tells us that extreme simplicity in movement rules at the individual level can result in a great deal of complexity at the level of the group .
bia &apos;s school stayed in place .
but let &apos;s start off by remembering that darwin showed how we &apos;re the outcome of four billion years of evolution .
it was around this time we went from 1k to 16k , which was quite the leap .
now , like doc edgerton , a scientist himself , science became art — an art of ultra-fast photography .
for every four barrels of oil that we consume , we only discover one .
the more i thought about it , i realized , no , it &apos;s still important .
and in just four weeks , the brain learns to process this new sensation and acquires a new sensory pathway — like a new sense .
it gives it information . by adding information to matter , it gives it a function that &apos;s different than without that structure .
but we also know it &apos;s only through experiment that we &apos;ll discover exactly how to run a low carbon city , how to care for a much older population , how to deal with drug addiction and so on .
as a matter of fact , we added to the contract .
( applause ) we &apos;ve hired and trained hundreds of facilitators to help guide people through the experience .
he said , &quot; &quot; what do you think it &apos;s like trying to run a country with 400 kinds of cheese ? &quot; &quot; but at the same time , we realize that our products are not safe and healthy .
mk : yeah , we were friends for a long time .
and this is about good taste , good traditions .
true story . true story .
we don &apos;t know the details of how this works , but we do know then that foxo genes can impact the lifespan of people .
if you look at our ancestors , the neanderthals and the homo erectus , our immediate ancestors , they &apos;re confined to small regions of the world .
what you just heard is &quot; &quot; skylife &quot; &quot; by david balakrishnan .
she said things she &apos;d always needed to say .
we also recognize that a lot of the products that we make — those videos and so forth — you know , they don &apos;t reach everybody , and so we &apos;ve been fostering projects that reach people outside of academia , and outside of the choir that most ecologists preach to .
this is why basically you have all this creative mistrust between the representatives and those whom they represent .
over the course of last year , open-source hardware hackers have come up with multiple models for usable , linux-based mobile phones , and the earth phone could spin off from this kind of project .
the greek word poem , it just means &quot; &quot; a made thing , &quot; &quot; and poetry is a set of techniques , ways of making patterns that put emotions into words .
so that &apos;s an asset because if you &apos;ve got to deal with the crash protection issues of the automobile , forget it — you &apos;re never going to fly it .
now , the irony is , of course , that every large company started off as a small , entrepreneurial company .
i was at one of their fundraising events earlier this year , and i was inspired to give a one-off donation when i remembered that my firm offers to match the charitable contributions its employees make .
she &apos;s here . she &apos;s also a doctor .
it &apos;s real stuff .
this is an old bicycle tube , which gives you a broad rubber band , two safety pins .
we actually met on mission blue i in the galapagos .
i get to read about mother-in-law jokes from mesopotamia from 3,500 years ago .
i &apos;m going to make a cut right there .
and you can see here that what it &apos;s doing is it &apos;s recording my eyes every time i blink .
there were no motel 6 &apos;s or howard johnsons for me .
and then the kids graduate , and you have no responsibility any more — that &apos;s very good , too .
and that will stop reusing a syringe 20 or 30 times .
i asked them to name me just 20 .
so you ask yourself , if education has become so much more expensive , has it become so much better ?
think enron , madoff , the mortgage crisis .
it &apos;s an acknowledgment of need or fallibility .
if you look over the past couple decades at the returns to capital — in other words , corporate profits — we see them going up , and we see that they &apos;re now at an all-time high .
and i pressed her , and i asked her , &quot; why did you come back and get your care here ? &quot;

( laughter ) and we are certainly not waiting for that check to drop through the letterbox before we start , and most importantly of all , we are not daunted by the sophisticated arguments that say , &quot; these small actions are meaningless in the face of tomorrow &apos;s problems , &quot; because i have seen the power of small actions , and it is awesome .
i &apos;m being a bit mysterious for those of you out there . what were they accused of ?
but not from a top-down institutional perspective , rather from the perspective of a refugee .
and then , finally talk a little bit about a third way , about another technology , which is probably better than anything we have , but which — there hasn &apos;t been any enthusiasm for adoption precisely because people are so enamored with the current car seat solution . ok .
but since it didn &apos;t happen here , we can put it out of our minds , and people like jenny mccarthy can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like &quot; &quot; oprah &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; larry king live . &quot; &quot; and they can do it because they don &apos;t link causation and correlation .
that i happen to own that fits inside a cereal box , and could maybe , without even touching their bird , i swear , get a perfect 3d scan . and i &apos;m even willing to sign pages saying that i &apos;ll never let anyone else have it , except for me in my office , i promise .
open your eyes , ezra .
and the jar of pills he had , he said , were the tiniest little pills he could find , so small you could barely see them .
the second shock feels less painful , because you get a bit used to it .
there are some people who are very good at this .
motorola makes the most widely used one , and you can see that they &apos;re used by secret service , they &apos;re used in combat , it &apos;s a very , very common standard in the u.s. and elsewhere .
and it &apos;s based on the cochlear of your ear , able to pick up internet , wireless , television signals and radio signals , in the same chip .
you know what you are ? a crocodile .
well , we actually surveyed over 120 individuals , and the results were mixed .
according to relevant researchers , 83 percent of the population of this planet lives in the societies without independent press .
experiments suggest that lightning could be the next gps .
so i decided — i had this crazy epiphany at two in the morning .
look at the strength and the will radiating from this woman .
simple rule number one : understand what others do .
bd : novocure &apos;s also working on lung cancer as the second target .
it &apos;s not enough to simply write people off .
look in the gray areas , and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there — yeah , it &apos;s amazing . there &apos;s nothing there . it &apos;s no trick .
we tell ourselves a story about other people &apos;s lives , and these stories make us feel terrible because they &apos;re designed to make us feel terrible .
the encyclopedia is just one in a long line of arabic erotica , much of it written by religious scholars .
they never even got out of their clothes .
lots of scientists did a lot of work to make crispr happen , and what &apos;s interesting to me is that these scientists are being supported by our society .
and as the father was administering these instructions , a car drove by , slowly , and just after it passed the father and the teenagers , a hand went out from the front passenger window , and — &quot; &quot; bam , bam ! &quot; &quot; — killing the father .
he actually raises money , solves my disputes .
we have seen a revolutionary breakthrough in the emergence of these exponential curves .
and if i want to explore the world — uh-oh , romo &apos;s tired — if i want to explore the world with romo , i can actually connect him from any other ios device .
not only are nba players ridiculously tall , they are ludicrously long .
people have found the collective as the slime mold finds the oats .
and then i was looking at my good work , and what i was doing is i was cutting the forests around here in b.c.
ka : it seems to me , among other things , a lovely piece of civic infrastructure .
and then , as he was doing that , he made an accidental click by hitting the touchpad — you &apos;ll see him do that .
and it is , to prevent rickets and so on .
and so , what did they test her for ?
we made progress in a lot of the areas like automated harvesting and efficient lighting .
now , this is subject to a lot of debate and controversy .
so again this is what they can see under the microscope .
her mother &apos;s doing everything she can .
this would tell you , you don &apos;t have my permission to send this image out .
( laughter ) by far .
you know , maybe it &apos;s not just humans at the right side of this chain that &apos;s duncey .
any one of you who gardens knows that there is something called the root-shoot ratio , and plants need to keep the root mass in some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy .
we &apos;re going to force you to act against your will , to bend to our will . &quot; &quot; then , number two , we keep these rules a secret from the dog .
is it being directed effectively ?
and so that &apos;s not going to be a solution that &apos;s going to get us global with biologic tissue .
and today , artists armed with that emotion , are grasping anatomy from the medical world , and are reinvigorating it through art in the most imaginative ways .
but originally the significance of the bindi is to symbolize the third eye between the spiritual world and the religious world .
that &apos;s what i call globalization chinese style .
so i set out to study electrical engineering and robotics , and my end-of-studies project was about building a robot called er-1 — it looked like this — that would collect information from its environment and proceed to follow a white line on the ground .
what we do is the exact opposite .
as you can see , the brain area is going up and down in each one of them , but the responses are very different , and not in sync .
and then marge deton .
this last fall , i went to the snow and ice data center in boulder , colorado , and talked to the researchers here in monterey at the naval postgraduate laboratory .
this is , of course , unless your whole life is about being secure .
what was my calling ? what should i do ?
the reason is you never go and bother to ask the losers who also purchased lottery tickets and didn &apos;t end up winning the prize .
none of the straight lines are actually straight .
but they get a lot more information about what you do online , what you like , what interests you .
they send it out for amateur rocketeers , and it said in there do not ever heat a mixture of potassium perchlorate and sugar .
his name was john belk . some of you will probably know him .
we then got to the last ancestor .
&#91; bbc news : &apos; end of virginity &apos; if women drive , saudi cleric warns &#93; ( laughter ) and only then we realized it &apos;s so empowering to mock your oppressor .
let &apos;s now see how the rest and the west compares in terms of how rich you are .
and one story i want to tell you about is how can we find targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder — a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear .
and civic leaders should deploy sensors and civic drones to detect rogue drones , and instead of sending killer drones of their own up to shoot them down , they should notify humans to their presence .
they made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work .
easy , right ?
it was all i did .
&#91; jennifer brea is sound-sensitive .
and you can see we got a guy from — who &apos;s just a fanatic about dinosaurs to do the sculpting for us , down to the spoon-shaped teeth and everything .
he comes back and instead of deciding that , well , now since i &apos;ve lost my leg , that second dream is over , he decides that he still has that dream of playing baseball , and he starts this group called vetsports , which now works with veterans all over the country and uses sports as a way of healing .
i &apos;m going to go off script and make chris quite nervous here by making this audience participation .
why would i want to go back to a body that was so broken ?
they don &apos;t represent what our views are .
what we &apos;re seeing in many of them is the rise of the youth bulge .
at 12,000 feet , where the air is thin , i once built two hole in the wall computers , and the children flocked there .
now , montel williams is an intelligent man .
for example , brazil — this beautiful country hosting tedglobal has the world &apos;s ugliest record .
and i would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice , that i was making a three-dimensional drawing of a horse that somehow moves in space .
and so that was the idea .
man 7 : after this bridge , first exit .
we should find out what they &apos;re doing and transfer that skill to other people . &quot; &quot; but i can tell you that absolutely is not happening today .
( applause ) oh , sorry .
they are generated by specific mechanisms that may make them predictable , perhaps controllable .
suddenly , we &apos;re seeing actions on the ground from local government . we &apos;re seeing this mainstreamed .
that would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint .
so i went back there with a 28 mm lens .
and countries with islam as the majority religion , all of them almost had six to seven children per woman , irregardless of the income level .
now , how does the most powerful country in the world handle these displaced people ?
( applause ) i like it . ( applause ) ( laughter ) dl : oh yeah , okay , in my family we had seven girls , four boys , we had two fiddles and one piano , and of course we were all fighting to play on the instruments , so dad and mom set a rule that you couldn &apos;t kick anyone off the instrument . you had to wait until they were finished , so of course , what we would do is we &apos;d get on the piano and you wouldn &apos;t even get off to eat , because you wouldn &apos;t want to give it up to your brother or sister , and they &apos;d wait and wait and wait , and it &apos;d be midnight
and it will cost you upwards of a billion dollars for that one success .
but i had this question .
it &apos;s extremely good at using available means to achieve a state in which its goal is realized .
and this is one of the great things about fruit flies .
and it actually happened again , with the fall of the berlin wall .
recording : ♫ daisy , daisy ♫ ♫ give me your answer do ♫ ♫ i &apos;m half crazy ♫ ♫ all for the love of you ♫ ♫ it can &apos;t be a stylish marriage ♫ ♫ i can &apos;t afford a carriage ♫ ♫ but you &apos;ll look sweet upon the seat ♫ ♫ of a bicycle built for two ♫ ak : so james surowieki has this idea of the wisdom of crowds , that says that a whole bunch of people are smarter than any individual .
the computer then talks to a machine — a computer-operated machine , a cad-cam machine — that can make a zillion different changes , at a moment &apos;s notice , because the computer is just a machine .
and the country that does this first will , in my view , leapfrog others in achieving a new economy even , an improved economy , an improved outlook .
let me give you two stats that seem like they &apos;re on opposite ends of the issue , but are actually two sides of the same coin .
so i just said , &quot; &quot; well , if that &apos;s the case , then i &apos;d like to leave . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and it never worked .
( laughter ) well , we would like to encourage all of you to do your part to help protect einstein &apos;s animal friends , and to do your part to help protect their homes that they live &#91; in &#93; .
republicans really dislike the democrats . we &apos;re changing .
state your name and age for the commission .
we all use wikipedia .
what about full knee replacements , from your data , made to measure , where all of the tools and guides are 3d printed ?
and the way i can figure that out is by looking at chunks , sequential chunks of binary information , and i look at the relationships between those chunks .
and i had the pleasure to work on the central plaza .
but it turns out that love is very strictly forbidden in the lower ranks of the guerrilla , so their romance was discovered and they were separated .
and the difference between performance and theater is huge .
and yet two random people will mate and have this child , and both of them have some pretty rotten genes , and the child is likely to come out to be average .
take your skin color , and celebrate it .
that &apos;s no longer the case . logging roads provide access to urban areas .
and it merges the stop sign and yield signs .
because at first i wanted — you know , i &apos;ve taken him on a couple of trips , but i wanted him to see people that live on a dollar a day or less .
bruno giussani : miguel , thank you for sticking to your time .
there are so many things to be happy about .
this is the grand cafe here in oxford .
it &apos;s no money down , and your utility bill decreases .
you &apos;re safe . it &apos;s fine .
earlier this year , with our friends from the imazon nonprofit here in brazil , we launched the first subnational social progress index .
and so i went to both — two race riots , one of which was the los angeles riot . and this next piece is from that .
take mexico , for example .
it &apos;s not completely gone . i &apos;m going to come back to that .
if you make some noise you can feel the effect .
it &apos;s a giant airbag .
but that all happened later .
it appears that the more secretions she &apos;s got , the more likely the baby is to suckle quickly .
these are the sounds you would expect , but they are also the sounds of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds screeching in the night , the high-pitched honest cries of children and the thunderous , unbearable silence .
they have invented narco-submarines and boats that are not detected by radar .
there &apos;s consequences for carbonate organisms .
but when it comes to our cities and thinking about how death fits in our cities , there &apos;s much less regulation and design and thought than we might imagine .
from regular , relative skydiving i went on to freeflying .
for doing this , i was incarcerated for a year in an assessment center which was actually a remand center . it was a virtual prison for young people .
and i &apos;m not really one for the warm , fuzzy feeling .
they sacrifice fun time . they sacrifice personal indulgence .
we can &apos;t stifle innovation in our business .
it &apos;s not linear . and our intuition is linear .
other creatures can enjoy them too .
this studies the circuitry in two people &apos;s brains that activates while they interact .
and then worked for the jerry brown administration .
my own child , i let that happen to . &quot; &quot; so that &apos;s an investigation of the negative imagination .
i found a couple in the work of matt groening , although matt groening told me later that he could not make my talk because it was a morning session and i gather that he is not an early riser .
she has this show right now at moma , where some of these early works are here on display at moma , on the walls .
but maybe mission blue can fill in that ocean that we can &apos;t see .
what do you think about your movie ?
yeah , the dad was really upset .
when the architects came , they brought us these things , and you &apos;ve probably seen things like this .
and what are the results ?
if we know what that set point is , we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow , and it will be when your challenges are higher than average and skills are higher than average .
so almost all the biology that we observe can be thought of as a series of problems and their corresponding solutions , and the first problem that every organ must solve is a continuous supply of nutrients to fuel all those cells of the body .
it &apos;s one of the largest organizations in the world for young people .
last year , i told you the story , in seven minutes , of project orion , which was this very implausible technology that technically could have worked , but it had this one-year political window where it could have happened .
and yeah , sub-atomic physics is deconstructive . you literally try to tear atoms apart to understand what &apos;s inside of them . but sculpture , from what i understand from great sculptors , is deconstructive , because you see a piece and you remove what doesn &apos;t need to be there .
these cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field , like a screen .
( laughter ) having a little bit of richard time . that &apos;s nice , that &apos;s good .
and those dreams are getting fulfilled .
now , up there , 20 feet above the stage , that &apos;s 10 trillion .
maybe applied for your driver &apos;s license , tried to do your taxes on your own .
so we ask the question again , &quot; &quot; how many straight lines can i draw through the point , but never meet the original line ? &quot; &quot; does someone want to guess ?
good question . there are two main reasons .
and first of all , you have to go with me for a second , and say , you know , you could take the word &quot; &quot; love &quot; &quot; out of a lot of things in our society , put the word &quot; &quot; design &quot; &quot; in , and it still works , like this quote here , you know . it kind of works , you know ?
i was asked last year to give a speech at the oslo freedom forum .
what do we find now ?
i assessed how long they were going to stay and how much it would take to feed them .
or die alone ?
the sound you &apos;re hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close .
now , we &apos;ve all seen a lot of tedtalks online , so let &apos;s watch one now with the sound turned off and the closed captioning turned on .
&#91; &quot; &quot; evict twitter &quot; &quot; &#93; somebody sent me this photo a few weeks ago , and it shows what is happening on the ground in san francisco , and i think you can actually try to understand that through looking at a map like this .
so my favorite visual effect in the movie is the one i &apos;m about to show you .
when you leave the opera house , you &apos;ll find there &apos;s braille signage in the lifts .
okay , you &apos;ve got something ? one more thing .
moving on from this , the next person to explore this field was a gentleman called hans jenny in the 1970s .
i wondered , what work ?
some of what we fear , i suspect , we fear in common .
and unbelievably , in 40 years , i was the first indian to be honored .
i think we should make this even more explicit .
so , that primal medium , which your brain is exquisitely wired for ...
the first one is we &apos;ve targeted the intraspecies communication system .
well , it might look a little bit like the 4,000 community-interest companies that have sprung up in the u.k. over the last five years and a similar rise in b corporations in the united states , enterprises that have ecological and social goals written into their constitution at their heart — companies , in fact , like this one , ecosia .
collaborator : i felt really sad when he died .
in addition , there can be some infectious agents that can also cause autism .
they checked .
design thinking is a process for innovation and problem solving .
&quot; &quot; i recall one patient who was at that point no more than a skeleton encased in shrinking skin , unable to speak , his mouth crusted with candida that was resistant to the usual medications .
they &apos;re good for the environment because they enable no-till farming , which leaves the soil in place , getting healthier from year to year — slso keeps less carbon dioxide going from the soil into the atmosphere .
and so , for example , let &apos;s take jupiter .
if you didn &apos;t , you failed .
she looked at me , and she said , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re exactly the person i need to talk to .
every time a forest is cut down , every time a marsh is filled in , it is a potential lab that goes with it , and which we will never , ever recover .
computers ! what about computers ?
it looks like a horse . it must be a horse .
and yet , the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn &apos;t silent .
they send little pulses of electricity down their processes to each other , and where they contact each other , those little pulses of electricity can jump from one neuron to the other .
why are you fighting so hard not to be yourself ?
don &apos;t create a problem for us , for manufacturing , for application , then we have to buy new companies , we have to buy our competitors , we have to do all kinds of things because you sold too many widgets .
this makes it a remarkably easy and powerful system to use .
there were just 254 left .
he would know what time the sun would rise , and what time it would set .
it &apos;s a space that is playful in its own way , and also purposeful , and in that space , the cartoons are different .
in many parts of sub-saharan africa , the droughts are so much worse .
it &apos;s the romantic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
i kept looking , and i looked at the far end of the town in mountain home , and there was a small trailer park .
what if we put holly into the same context as humans ?
so you say , yeah , well , what are really the chances of this happening ?
( laughter ) and here is our factory in cape town where we make horses .
there were a lot of them .
we have identified over 400 species of bees in pennsylvania .
on the other hand , you &apos;re doing something new , no one &apos;s ever done before , you get it completely wrong . how should you be treated ?
and our new project is having the inmates and ourselves learn how to raise the oregon spotted frog which is a highly endangered amphibian in washington state and oregon .
our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work , they should be able to choose between at least a handful of different cities that were all competing to attract new residents .
i can photograph it from any angle , and it will still look 2d .
but anyway , i think we need to beat them again .
together they grow their own food .
in fact , it was so successful that there &apos;s no way that these days you could make a book like this .
we get to exercise some ancient , ancient drives .
they &apos;ve incurred violent infractions by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners .
and also it takes them forever to act on cells .
this is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine .
i really want to live in a world where disability is not the exception , but the norm .
three-fourths of our oil fuel is transportation .
and he was going to speak at the high school next door to us .
thank you .
we use these things as stopgaps for things that we can &apos;t explain .
let &apos;s do the reflection in x first , followed by the rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise .
we go to magic shows in order to be fooled .
so for example , action unit 12 , it &apos;s not a hollywood blockbuster , it is actually a lip corner pull , which is the main component of a smile .
and what you see are substantial improvements of their immediate memory , of their ability to remember things after a delay , of their ability to control their attention , their language abilities and visual-spatial abilities .
and the wonderful elation that we had when we finally completed it .
now , this suggests that if you could just block waterborne transmission , you could cause disease organisms to shift from the right-hand side of that graph to the left-hand side of the graph .
that eventually we &apos;ll train monkeys to do , or cells or robots , or maybe not even need to do it at all , i was off running the future of the residency program , which is really the future of medicine . &quot; &quot; and they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back .
in africa last year , africans ate 600 million wild animals , and consumed two billion kilograms of bush meat .
unfortunately , empirical data , good , hard stats , don &apos;t exist , and therefore to prove my point , i first of all had to find some proxy way of uncovering how much food was being wasted .
and they kind of took me into the farm and showed me what it was like to live and work .
that &apos;s great , except the places that have malaria really bad , they don &apos;t have health care systems .
and if you &apos;re a fish , and you haven &apos;t gotten your glob in the morning , you &apos;re going to get it in the afternoon , because they &apos;ve got your number .
we are coming out of 50 years , most unusual years , of history in which we have had a totally mono-polar world , in which every compass needle for or against has to be referenced by its position to washington — a world bestrode by a single colossus .
that will blow away a lot of the opposition .
we have charted our love for our child over time .
when you eat healthier , manage stress , exercise and love more , your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen .
and it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question , and it &apos;s extremely hard to answer .
so that people could have something more than just sms ?
the myth of national identity and the vocabulary of coming from confuses us into placing ourselves into mutually exclusive categories .
our enemies shall talk themselves to death , and we will fight them with their own confusion .
this is where gut decisions come from .
we saw geysers coming out .
and for the purposes of this talk , i wanted to isolate just a part of a project that &apos;s even a part of a project that touches a little bit on this theme of architectural special effects , and it happens to be our current obsession , and it plays a little bit with the purging and adding of distraction .
you know , someone sitting next to you in a seat — that &apos;s ok because you &apos;re in a theater , but if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you , you &apos;d freak out .
why is it important to reboot ? what does the red represent ?
so we &apos;d say things like , let &apos;s agree that you &apos;re going to sell 57 widgets per week .
your heart gets more blood flow .
and then i realized i have no idea how we &apos;re going to solve this problem , but i do know one thing : we have got to change the tone of this conversation .
but i think it &apos;s worth the effort , because the alternative , to blindly fight all hackers , is to go against the power you cannot control at the cost of stifling innovation and regulating knowledge .
we &apos;re living in an era of scientific creationism , 9 / 11 conspiracy theories , psychic hotlines , and a resurgence of religious fundamentalism .
governments and civil societies are experimenting with new approaches .
but a place , i think , where the effort is really worthwhile is where people are wrestling with quite serious problems — things like education or security or finance or health .
i was frozen by fear , curled up in the corner of my pitch-black closet clutching my gay grenade , and moving one muscle is the scariest thing i have ever done .
it was a joke .
thank you very much .
so basically , every time we feel that we are on the brink of peace , the conflict explodes again .
it has to do with the favelas , the slums — whatever you call it , there are different names all over the world .
by invisible , i mean it doesn &apos;t absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum .
mom says , &quot; &quot; if they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them , you must always say , &apos; nothing . &apos; and if they insist , say , &apos; whatever you mind to give me . &apos; &quot; &quot; this was the nature of being at that table .
thank you very much .
perhaps the tremendous progress we &apos;ve made over the last century by a series of forces are , in fact , accelerating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of abundance .
so no ego problems .
so i &apos;m very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross-section of my work that i &apos;ve done on the polar regions .
ca : to a lay person it seems like he has certain things to offer the u.s. , the government , you , others , in terms of putting things right and helping figure out a smarter policy , a smarter way forward for the future .
we can understand how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation that was set down 13.72 billion years ago — and yet , we can do calculations today to predict how it will look and it matches .
i guess we could make a glow chicken .
the driving cities in the sun belt , the dallases and the phoenixes and , sorry , atlanta , these cities are not appearing on the list .
in my mind , and in my dreams every night i chagall-man float over the city twirl and swirl with my toes kissing the floor .
there will be stronger storms and greater flooding .
but to a liberal , it sounds like this dog is running for the republican nomination .
that sense of hope , we &apos;re going to hold ,
we want to stop that gene from turning on , fusing those hands together , so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand , like the archaeopteryx .
only when women have critical mass in every department at your companies , including building platforms from the ground up , will the conversations about priorities and solutions change .
however , i also think it &apos;s got to do with the fact that bats come out at night , and we don &apos;t really understand them . we &apos;re a little frightened by things that can perceive the world slightly differently than us .
and this is something that a lot of americans want .
( music ) ♫ i don &apos;t understand myself , ♫ ♫ why they keep talking of love , ♫ ♫ if they come near me , ♫ ♫ if they look into my eyes and kiss my hand . ♫ ♫ i don &apos;t understand myself , ♫ ♫ why they talk of magic , ♫ ♫ that no one withstands , ♫ ♫ if he sees me , if he passes by . ♫ ♫ but if the red light is on ♫ ♫ in the middle of the night ♫ ♫ and everybody listens to my song , ♫ ♫ then it is plain to see . ♫ ♫ my lips , they give so fiery a kiss , ♫
inca sculptures are regarded as treasures in british museums , while shakespeare is translated into every major language of the earth .
( applause ) ( boomerang noises ) it was coming straight for me . i had to . it was , yeah .
the truth was my grandfather took me to parades , we had lots of those .
and so what we see , i think , is that small , collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope .
these people don &apos;t mind that i once worked as a singing waitress to help pay for college .
we only get one , and wow , did we ever get a good one .
what release finally , the embrace : though we were wary — it seemed so audacious — how much unspoken joy there was in that affirmation of equality and communion , no matter how much misunderstanding and pain had passed between you by then .
would you like a better system ?
and to remind you that here is an example in which architecture actually did something .
one value of older people is that they are increasingly useful as grandparents for offering high-quality childcare to their grandchildren , if they choose to do it , as more young women enter the workforce and as fewer young parents of either gender stay home as full-time caretakers of their children .
my background should have led me to a different direction .
mr : thank you very much indeed , cynthia kenyon .
but i come to this work after a long history as a social justice activist , and so i &apos;m really interested in the ways that people talk about nonfiction storytelling as though it &apos;s about more than entertainment , as though it &apos;s about being a catalyst for social action .
much of the debate in the u.s. has been about metadata .
that conflict , that tension , will be with us forever , that sometimes it wants to do what it wants to do , and sometimes it &apos;s going to do things for us .
actually , it &apos;s a small manufacturing plant set up by grameen danone , a joint venture between grameen bank of muhammad yunus and the food multinational danone to make high-quality yogurt in bangladesh .
and then back to simplicity again .
that means there &apos;s no waiting for chemical reactions to take place , no need to use reagents that can run out and no need to be an expert to get actionable information .
we &apos;ve heard a lot about what they can and can &apos;t do .
within a year , everybody over 40 was dead .
think about ipods compared to stereos .
read that great piece in the new yorker about how our echo boomers , 19 to 25 , over in iraq taught each other how to do sys admin work , over the internet in chat rooms .
how risky is this ?
what we need are for people to care , to actually go use it , just like they &apos;ve cared enough to use kiva to make those connections .
and then when it &apos;s not using it , it actually can roll it down into its head just like the headlights on your lamborghini .
in that year , we are not available for any of our clients .
they assumed two percent , and that made it a pretty hopeless story , because population growth was two and a half .
and who would talk to terrorists ?
our vice president of operation kissing the board . obviously very , very excited .
and i remember this plan , born out of frustration from a kid who kept calling me &quot; &quot; yogi , &quot; &quot; then pointed at my tummy and said , &quot; &quot; too many picnic baskets . &quot; &quot; turns out it &apos;s not that hard to trick someone , and one day before class , i said , &quot; yeah , you can copy my homework , &quot; and i gave him all the wrong answers that i &apos;d written down the night before .
there are entrepreneurs in the netherlands that produce them , and one of them is here in the audience , marian peeters , who &apos;s in the picture .
so the sweet spot is between 5 and 13 .
he &apos;s going to listen and be really interested .
now , how do i know that i &apos;m right about this somewhat confusing poem ?
people seem to think politics is sexy .
there i would hear people say my father was a &quot; &quot; moudjahid &quot; &quot; and that means &quot; &quot; fighter . &quot; &quot; later on , in france , i loved eavesdropping on grownups &apos; conversations , and i would hear all sorts of stories about my father &apos;s previous life , especially that he had &quot; &quot; done &quot; &quot; world war ii , that he had &quot; &quot; done &quot; &quot; the algerian war .
so as i shake this ketchup bottle , i get some true sensory feedback as the function of time in the bottom row .
but if you don &apos;t need it , and somebody else gives you the shock , it &apos;s not a good thing .
i &apos;ve been simplifying things for 30 years .
we need to take a really positive view .
the brain could only change within certain set limits .
if you have a good wi-fi connection or 3g , this process is very , very quick .
he voted in favor of the bill , in favor of a law that would allow businesses to not serve me .
l-dopa &apos;s a drug , as you know , given for treating parkinson &apos;s disease , which is related to a decrease in dopamine .
you have to take 1,000 pictures per second to see this .
i think you might get a random jumble of letters that looks like this .
my doctor told me that in order to heal my brain , i had to rest it .
unencumbered by clinical responsibilities , unwilling to take no for an answer from those bureaucracies that tend to crush patients , and with an unparalleled ability for information retrieval honed through years of using google .
peter diamandis : probably the most difficult thing that i had to do was raise the capital for this . it was literally impossible .
it &apos;s a business plan for a corporation .
okay , now why then is this curious reluctance and curious hostility to consciousness ?
for example , the psychologist daniel oppenheimer , a few years ago , teamed up with high school teachers .
&quot; please get fisa right . &quot;
and he was working on gyroscopes ; he has a number of patents for that kind of thing .
so , these are early examples in the lab of emerging technologies to digitize fabrication . computers that don &apos;t control tools but computers that are tools , where the output of a program rearranges atoms as well as bits .
and here &apos;s what that means for us .
so very carefully we had to mechanically scrape off all the wax .
tk : that hand &apos;s not so good for clapping .
other ones are kind of going like this . all right .
because what happens in a singly-linked list — this is trying to remove an existing entry from a list — and there &apos;s a difference between if it &apos;s the first entry or whether it &apos;s an entry in the middle .
they were reeling from the earthquake , they were reeling from cholera that was brought in by un peacekeepers and still hasn &apos;t been eradicated .
so here &apos;s an image of red blood cells , and now we can actually map where the hemozoin and where the malaria parasites are inside those red blood cells .
it &apos;s important for us to grow organically .
but he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me to work directly for him in the white house .
it has 300 options , i &apos;m paying for 300 ; i &apos;m using only three but i &apos;m willing to live with it , therefore it is scaling up .
the message reads , &#91; arabic &#93; &quot; you can crush the flowers , but you can &apos;t delay spring . &quot;
all this striving for security , in fact , has made you much more insecure because now you have to watch out all the time .
they were sitting at a table . they were brought together for us .
so , close to 200,000 people a day migrate from the rural to the urban areas .
it &apos;s very ironic .
and i &apos;ve been thinking a lot about what i have learned over these last particularly 11 years with v-day and &quot; &quot; the vagina monologues , &quot; &quot; traveling the world , essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet to stop violence against women .
in fact , when we run the numbers , it looks like it &apos;ll take us at least 15 years before we can fully finance all our conservation efforts .
and i &apos;m only showing you a little bit of this .
thank you frans de waal , wherever you are , i love you and i &apos;d give anything to meet you .
and this is what we spend a lot of our time doing , is just making sure that we can keep up with this kind of traffic load .
and essentially , the oceans are breathing through the southern ocean .
you &apos;re wrong , because it &apos;s the opposite .
the stories of the colonoscopies were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
the only way you can do that is to not swim on top of the water .
the way i look back in the past is by using the fossilized remains of deepwater corals .
and i was getting it all on film and i was recording it , and i was thinking , &quot; &quot; this is it . this is the possibility of it maybe working .
dreams are a form of consciousness on this definition .
so , there &apos;s this guy , right ? victorian era .
and i would like to make a case to you that over the years since we first developed atomic weaponry , until this very moment , we &apos;ve actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world that &apos;s characterized by two phases , which i &apos;m going to go through with you right now .
the first one is harm / care .
jay chiat is a glutton for punishment , and he hired me to do a house for him in the hamptons .
but the bird , instead of flying away , goes flop , flop , flop and lands on my head .
that &apos;s how the system &apos;s supposed to work .
ck : yes , that &apos;s right .
there is different type of barbaria .
and then sort of through a process of wandering around , i got to the thought that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars , in a way that is convenient and affordable , you could get to a solution .
number one : china feels as if it &apos;s been humiliated at the hands of the west through a hundred years of history , beginning with the opium wars .
don &apos;t be daunted . just do your job .
i started a foundation to bet on these good people doing good things .
( laughter ) &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve misjudged this women , &quot; &quot; thought mr. dickens .
but what i want to point out is you can buy this from itunes .
you &apos;re going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so , i gave myself the job title of ted custodian for a reason , and i will promise you right here and now that the core values that make ted special are not going to be interfered with .
he was trying to tell people how they should live through the medium of sermons , the classic medium of delivery of religions .
and there &apos;s evan .
and so i &apos;ll just go get them .
and sometimes it &apos;s about a legacy of the neighborhood , like in morrisania , about the jazz history .
so when i went through the data , i had very surprising results , because i found that four out of the five marinating ingredients actually inhibited the carcinogen formation .
how many inventors and untold entrepreneurs live out this phenomenon ?
and fundamentally , it &apos;s a story about how starting as very small children and continuing out all the way to the greatest accomplishments of our culture , we get the world right .
i don &apos;t see anybody actually being able to do that very effectively .
what i &apos;m showing you again here is this map of the human microbiome project data , so each point represents a sample from one body site from one of 250 healthy adults .
i recognize the pain they caused to others , for which there can be no forgiveness , but the pain they caused to me , there is , &quot; &quot; she said .
and if not , can you make yourself smart again ?
those girls have never touched google .
today i want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have , which is the choice overload problem .
and afghanistan , afghanistan , we think has probably stopped polio repeatedly .
eh : not bad .
we don &apos;t know how far it will go , but it &apos;s going on .
he had a bold idea that — what he called the cognitive trade-off hypothesis .
so here &apos;s the situation .
i like the idea of collaboration with people like that because it pushes you .
we are policing the world , and how are we doing that ?
bob dylan is 23 years old , and his career is just reaching its pinnacle .
war and malnutrition kills people together with hope .
and the reason it does is not because of the clever encryption .
now , i know what you &apos;re thinking .
ok , that &apos;s fair enough .
the next bit , we &apos;d chartered a pretty elderly russian plane to fly us up to a town called khatanga , which was the sort of last bit of civilization .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve had these people approach you before .
i have faith , for instance , that peace in the middle east is possible despite the ever-accumulating mass of evidence to the contrary .
so how we use yeast in the future is going to be really interesting .
so these are a couple of instrumentalists .
everest is an extreme environment .
that &apos;s what the experience of the last 20 years has been .
on the other end of the spectrum , some were so sick they had to live in complete darkness , unable to tolerate the sound of a human voice or the touch of a loved one .
maybe some of you have received an email that says something like , &quot; &quot; hi , i &apos;m a nigerian banker , and i &apos;d like to give you 53 billion dollars because i like your face . &quot; &quot; or funnycats.exe , which rumor has it was quite successful in china &apos;s recent campaign against america .
if someone was to throw an egg at the sistine chapel , we &apos;d all go crazy .
( music ) and so they &apos;re beautiful , but this libertarian has some important lessons he wants us to learn from this .
and so we prospered in a way that no other animal has .
and it didn &apos;t stop there .
so after i returned home , i received word that one member of the family had been shot 30 times in the face .
and then we took these flies and allowed them to make choices .
but in this country , where the government apparently does not feel compelled to provide health care for citizens , ( laughter ) we &apos;ve taken a very different approach .
all four of my oars broke before i reached halfway across .
but this one is — the bible says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month , and more than that , you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat .
so , why is that ?
it may just take the right crazy idea .
so in this image , what you can see is that everything smaller than five nanometers is going from the blood , through the kidney , into the urine , and everything else that &apos;s bigger is retained .
( audience : random . ) michael sandel : at random . you would do it by lottery .
but when you get specific , when you actually ask about the actual taxing and spending issues under consideration , people are remarkably centrist , they &apos;re remarkably open to compromise .
so every second , half of the library of congress is swooshing around in this machine . it &apos;s a big machine .
and you all know that if you are going to determine whether you &apos;re related to your brother or your sister , you can &apos;t do it by looking at differences .
now , technology has changed a lot since the victrola days .
so with all these theatric elements , this pushes me in another role , and that would be , possibly , the dramaturge .
we &apos;ve discovered things like , for example , rna interference only a few years ago , and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work .
so let &apos;s make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana .
just think of sebastian and how he bought the cat to influence his .
the person i believed for half of my life to have superpowers suddenly needed help to get dressed or to cut food .
the good news is i &apos;m very aware of my responsibilities to get you out of here because i &apos;m the only thing standing between you and the bar .
not enough to stabilize the climate .
who &apos;s not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings — if you &apos;re different from all the other beings ?
and then you &apos;d see an image of britney spears to remind you of this funny anecdote you want to tell .
take the planet venus .
( music ) but basically , it &apos;s just a b , with four sads .
( laughter ) so , i took a look at my life , a hard look at my life , and i saw some things very disturbing . ( laughter )
and i don &apos;t mean the whole economy , because to grow an economy of india to the size of u.k. — that &apos;s a piece of cake , with one billion people .
on the other side , there is this girl .
and some people think that &apos;s a good thing .
right ? and then i realized , that was on my website , and then it said , like , you know , the quote was attributed to me and i thought , oh , i said something , you know , in an interview .
it &apos;s got a remarkably clear yes / no answer , and just requires phenomenal grunt .
i hope that you will take a look at it .
( laughter ) but , you know , i could pop a book on in the middle of the night , and — ( laughter ) ( applause ) now , the kurzweil reader is simply a program on my laptop .
they would not leave me alone until i let them have a piece , but it was not a good one . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) well , it occurred to me that i should invite dr. robicsek to lecture at wofford college on — what else ?
education is often of poor quality .
and if they &apos;re on a smartphone on google , they &apos;ve got access to more knowledge and information than president clinton did 15 years ago .
&quot; &quot; strange , &quot; &quot; he agreed .
i &apos;m excited when i glimpse that kind of thinking writ large .
i &apos;m a historian by training , and what i study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy — meaning human bodies , animal bodies — how they dealt with bodily fluids , concepts of bodies ; how have they thought about bodies .
however , i longed to share my life with someone .
but yes there are some solutions .
and when this story posted , i ran to my computer to send it to the imf official .
yeah , you all have a body , right ?
it stayed here and tried not to move any part of its body .
next is maynard sipes .
guys , we have an issue .
if you look at birds , which live a long time , cells from the birds tend to be more resistant to a lot of different environmental stresses like high temperature or hydrogen peroxide , things like that .
and that begins to lift a heavy burden off the world &apos;s poor .
here &apos;s another case that i think is interesting .
what has changed our society has been wireless devices .
how important is this ?
it means that you have to save more today .
i don &apos;t quite mean that the golden rule itself is written in our genes , but you can go to a hunter gatherer society that has had no exposure to any of the great religious traditions , no exposure to ethical philosophy , and you &apos;ll find , if you spend time with these people , that , basically , they believe that one good turn deserves another , and that bad deeds should be punished .
he came up with our name and logo . we &apos;re mission motors .
now , years ago , when i was working at youtube , we were looking for ways to encourage more people to rate videos , and it was interesting because when we looked into the data , we found that almost everyone was exclusively using the highest five-star rating , a handful of people were using the lowest one-star , and virtually no one was using two , three or four stars .
i made a promise that the next time i would fly around the world , it would be with no fuel , independent from fossil energies , in order to be safe , not to be threatened by the fuel gauge .
if you remember what i told you about fls at the beginning , it &apos;s knowledge and skills .
( laughter ) okay . okay . oh , well .
now , in the 20th century we had a revolution that was initiated at the beginning of the 20th century , and which is still going on .
and i don &apos;t think that we should give up on beauty .
why don &apos;t we take it a little longer — maybe two hours instead of an hour — and have less of this intensity ? &quot; &quot; and the nurses told me two things .
how well are we doing determining what piece to move where ?
they just thought , &quot; &quot; well , we &apos;ll give a course of 10 .
and no tricky shit behind the thing . i mean , it &apos;s all — you &apos;ve got to be very honest with what you &apos;re doing if it really is going to work .
the idea is that the building blocks of the digital economy are connectivity and entrepreneurship .
and i think we probably do need to pay some more attention to that , because it &apos;s actually kind of fragile .
and at seven o &apos;clock every night , i took me some more girls , already corrupted .
they have learned their lesson . they will control .
nl : i am the peer of whoever i &apos;m talking to .
thank you .
unfortunately , i don &apos;t fly trans-atlantic business class often enough to know , or any other kind of business class really , but i assume that in business class , you don &apos;t hear many expressions of , you know , bigotry about racial groups or ethnic groups , because the people who are flying trans-atlantic business class are doing business with all these people ; they &apos;re making money off all these people . and i really do think that , in that sense at least , capitalism has been a constructive force , and more fundamentally , it &apos;s a non-zero-sumness that has been a constructive force in expanding people &apos;s realm of moral awareness . i think the non-zero-sum dynamic ,
sometimes i can stand before the world — and when i say this , transformation is a difficult and slow process — sometimes i can stand before the world and say , &quot; &quot; my name is chris abani .
ok , so , confession : i &apos;ve always been weirdly obsessed with advertising .
and different people will have different places they want it set .
so this is a picture of me holding one of the first watercolor paintings i ever made .
men have sex before marriage , and people more or less turn a blind eye .
in fact , nothing expresses that assumption more clearly than three simple numbers : 9-1-1 , which , of course , is the number for the emergency police operator here in canada and in the united states , where the average response time to a police 911 emergency call is about 10 minutes .
but the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first .
tbl : can you say &quot; &quot; now &quot; &quot; ?
as an absolute connection , it only works one way .
and on the other end of the spectrum , this is a microstructure .
( laughter ) and when she saw him , he was down on one knee , he had the ring out .
now we can take the words and start to build sentences out of them .
but then he decides , &quot; let me tweak my tactics a little bit . &quot;
so this is a plate of nachos .
there &apos;s something that it feels like to drink beer which is not what it feels like to do your income tax or listen to music , and this qualitative feel automatically generates a third feature , namely , conscious states are by definition subjective in the sense that they only exist as experienced by some human or animal subject , some self that experiences them .
they &apos;re all searching for their staircase .
office worker : got a ham and swiss on rye ? bm : no .
so i don &apos;t know , it started to become an interesting mix .
you degrade forests , you go beyond the boundary on land , you undermine the ability of the climate system to stay stable .
i pushed back .
if you really want great hamburger , it turns out it makes a difference if you align the grain .
it would have the interdisciplinarity of the ted conference .
that &apos;s one of the themes that sylvia reminds us about : understand this ocean of ours , this basic life support system , the dominant life support system on the planet .
and we &apos;d sing this old song . she didn &apos;t have a whole lot of energy , so i &apos;d sing , &quot; &quot; hey , hey ! &quot; &quot; and she &apos;d just answer back with , &quot; &quot; black-eyed susie . &quot; &quot; oh , hey , hey , black-eyed susie ! hey , hey , black-eyed susie !
and fortunately , in the course of this project , the transplant surgeons and the other people decided , forget common practice . we have to switch .
( laughter ) so in the studio , rather than drawing , we began to learn how to knit .
there is some modeling of ecosystems going on now .
and from , you know , fattushis , to taxistan to , you know , for the fashtoonks , botoxia , pashmina , khlintunisia , you know , we were able to take the city and make fun of this completely foreign , who are — what &apos;s going on over here ?
this is why i can wear my gho with pride .
but then i thought , oh , i &apos;m sending myself mixed messages .
maybe we don &apos;t recognize it every time , but we understand that it happens .
i do dream in x-ray . i see my projects in my sleep .
and this is just a very simple way of understanding what kind of innovation , what kind of different design we need .
literally hundreds of elevator rides were spent with me alone stuffing the pump into my spanx , hoping the doors wouldn &apos;t open unexpectedly .
and what hotel means , in kenya and india , is an eating-place .
talk to any astrophysicist .
as you get towards the 1970s , things are going to start to change .
some of them were toys . some of them were candy .
and if you don &apos;t know them , that &apos;s okay . most casual players probably do .
from my american perspective , when a paying customer makes a reasonable request based on her preferences , she has every right to have that request met .
it &apos;s just a question to use some techniques like the time lapse .
i know most people don &apos;t see it that way .
food can be there and people can &apos;t buy it .
jihad may at times take the form of fighting , but only sometimes , under strict conditions , within rules and limits .
take , for example , the incidents of suicide baiting .
here &apos;s another one . bang .
he went into a coma .
so there &apos;s some that are all about the toast , and all about the transformation of toast .
it took me weeks of internal thinking to try to reconcile the good reasons we had to assist that family and the soldier of fortune he became .
and it seemed like time that we become that way ourselves .
well , i thought there would be a podium , so i &apos;m a bit scared .
and in that sense , ballooning is a beautiful metaphor .
should i take vitamin c ? should i be taking wheatgrass ?
we hired a team of physicists , software engineers and biologists to work on this , and the first thing we had to work on was to create the human body , basically .
my story begins right here actually in rajasthan about two years ago .
just a few examples : an artist who paints with fluorescent physarum ; a collaborative team who are combining biological and electronic design with 3d printing technologies in a workshop ; another artist who is using the slime mold as a way of engaging a community to map their area .
but in fact , in a few years , organizations will know so much about us , they will be able to infer our desires before we even form them , and perhaps buy products on our behalf before we even know we need them .
i have to say , these are very hybrid places .
we were spending so much time with this leopard and getting to understand her individualism , her personal character , that maybe we were taking it a little bit far .
and just to give you a flavor of how well this works , this is the result we get when we analyze this for some familiar words .
what &apos;s missing ? what would i like to know ?
this is bringing together international — there are 50 nations involved in this mission — interagency — these development agencies — and private-public , to take on this kind of security .
the scientific embargo — if it &apos;s ever submitted to &quot; &quot; nature , &quot; &quot; hopefully , it will be accepted .
i &apos;m a member of the blackfeet nation .
it &apos;s a satellite that goes into space , which is probably the least open-source thing you can imagine , and it contains an arduino connected to a bunch of sensors . so if you know how to use arduino , you can actually upload your experiments into this satellite and run them .
they &apos;ve been bombed by the military , they &apos;ve been besieged , they &apos;ve been stormed by isis and they &apos;ve been cut off from supplies for years .
it &apos;s about the same as yours and mine .
i think , if you live with your head in the clouds every now and then , it helps you keep your feet on the ground .
let &apos;s look at the pantheon and the piazza della rotonda in front of it .
i &apos;ve been building topsoil .
you &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; aha , but new zealand has a higher gdp than chad ! &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a good point , well made .
i was a new mother and a young rabbi in the spring of 2004 and the world was in shambles .
so the country in the world with the highest social progress , the number one country on social progress is new zealand .
when did we originate as a species ?
so the 20th century , then , saw how much more complex reality was , but it also saw a positive side .
they couldn &apos;t hear what i was saying in the context of a 10 back-to-back powerpoint presentation conference .
soon , you &apos;ll be able to look inside your brain and program , control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there .
and i &apos;m not talking about all comedy here , because , clearly , there &apos;s plenty of humor that colors safely within the lines of what we already think and feel .
now we &apos;ve got the data , plus we have metadata .
you &apos;ve gone through hundreds of tv channels , just switching channel after channel , and then suddenly you actually stop on one .
i have won a lot of awards through this work .
leandro started a campaign using one of our tools , the pressure cooker , the same one that bia and jovita used , and the state government changed their minds before christmas eve .
so what you do one day is you take a pile of arrowheads , and you walk up to the one that can &apos;t speak very well , and you put the arrowheads down in front of him , hoping that he &apos;ll get the idea that you want to trade your arrowheads for finished arrows .
there &apos;s also a huge emotional impact .
rb : yeah , as it turned out , it proved to be the right move .
well , you know , sometimes the most important things come in the smallest packages .
the important question is , &quot; &quot; is it interesting ? &quot; &quot; and i follow this question , not worrying about &quot; &quot; is it music ? &quot; &quot; — not worrying about the definition of the thing that i &apos;m making .
then you can look at the ratios of those numbers , and figure out for a data center where you don &apos;t have that information , you can figure out , but maybe you only have one of those , you know the square footage , then you could figure out well , maybe the power is proportional .
in contrast , they will walk an extra mile to avoid people who are not having fun .
i received a poignant tweet .
well , we &apos;ve seen that that can &apos;t be true .
on the other , the non-u.s.-related threats out of those 54 , the other 42 of them , the prism program was hugely relevant to that , and in fact was material in contributing to stopping those attacks .
and she looked at me , and she said , &quot; &quot; but , aimee , that &apos;s not fair . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) ( applause ) and the incredible thing was she really meant it .
jb : it &apos;s so powerful . richard ford , who &apos;s won the pulitzer prize , says that dyslexia helped him write sentences .
it made it possible for us to take close-up pictures of people 100 kilomteres away , like this one . ( laughter ) people called us and asked , how is this man doing ?
and they &apos;re coming into the city by rail .
now i &apos;m going to play the burst for you .
from &apos; 83 to &apos; 95 : two percent per annum .
so if we had some way to stop this scaling — and so i picked up some shells on the beach . and i asked them , what is scaling ? what &apos;s inside your pipes ?
this is all done in between the ribs .
it &apos;s just love . that &apos;s all it is .
so we &apos;ve developed certain tactics and strategies to cover up .
the paper you &apos;re holding in your hand contains the details of iraqi civilians that died as result of the invasion .
thus 900,000 people either have died or have significant damage to their heart muscle .
and she makes them so they could either be broken up into payments , or they could be like these , which are leaves that can be payments .
pretty quickly i saw that if you had more than a few values you &apos;d never remember on the screen where things were .
for me , the design exercise always begins here with the periodic table , enunciated by another professor , dimitri mendeleyev .
because even through the squeaks of his hearing aids , his understanding of music was profound .
in june 2010 , internet changed my life forever .
and i says , &quot; &quot; well , try me . &quot; &quot; and then he said , &quot; &quot; but i don &apos;t believe that you can do this . &quot; &quot; so i said , &quot; &quot; ok . &quot; &quot; so , to cut a long story short , i went home , went underneath the microscope , and i crushed up a piece of glass , crushed it up .
the next moment , as soon as they finished and disappeared into the shadows , a young man with a propane lantern came on , hung it up on a tree , set up a curtain .
now , these ideas and these events allow us even to deconstruct iconic places that many of you have been to , like machu picchu .
i could feel the wind against my face and the beat of my racing heart as if it were happening in that very moment .
and maybe something else .
now , the balance that i try to fight for , i , as any good liberal , try to fight for first by looking to the government . total mistake , right ?
instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem , design the solution around what the human will do as well .
these legs that i was on , which i &apos;ll take out right now — i was the first person in the world on these legs .
i &apos;ll just take you to bangladesh for a minute .
the computer was cracked open .

i want to say , &quot; &quot; computer , let &apos;s design a car , &quot; &quot; and the computer shows me a car .
so , a patient can come in and actually blow into their device .
i mean kgb , and not just kgb , used to torture in order to actually get this data .
thank you .
then you can of course always go and see this guy .
it &apos;s the coolest stuff .
now , why would neuroscientists say that we don &apos;t just construct , we reconstruct ?
but some day , some day , maybe it &apos;s going to work .
so netra was stuck with 30 paintings of mine .
you see how resistant it is to those very ideas .
we can see them indirectly , because black holes wreak havoc on their environment .
she looked at me and i looked at her .

one on the extreme right is a photograph of an american footballer .
if we do more in a kind of a stupid way , the simplicity gets complex and , in fact , we can keep on doing it for a very long time .
and all of the muslim majority countries across the income are coming down , as do the christian majority countries in the middle income range .
a few energy geeks spread out across the room .
now , it &apos;s interesting , because we &apos;ve embraced this darwinian view of a continuity in physical evolution , this physical continuity .

so what this means now is that those traits we then look at and so readily see — facial features , skin color , hair structure — are not determined by single genes with big effects , but are determined by many different genetic variants that seem to vary in frequency between different parts of the world .
particularly , there &apos;s a place called europa , which is — europa is one of the moons of jupiter , where we see a very level ice surface , which looks as if it &apos;s floating on top of an ocean .

the spirit of these labs , it &apos;s open , it &apos;s positive , but , you know , sometimes when people think of us , the first thing that comes to mind is bio-safety , bio-security , all the dark side stuff .
and when these four cells work together in health and harmony , they create an extraordinary symphony of electrical activity , and it is this electrical activity that underpins our ability to think , to emote , to remember , to learn , move , feel and so on .

and in terms of the line of poetry , why does the poet use the word hare rather than rabbit ?

out of a list of 26 topics , salary is only number eight .
we &apos;ve taken this information and we &apos;ve made a mathematical model out of it .
and myth says that he had an audience with the oracle , and it foretold his destiny of greatness .
as a journalist , i think these stories of what people in power do when no one is watching , are precisely the stories that we need to tell .
and not only that , i am documenting it — documenting my own cultural shortcomings .
but i took a liking to them because they dwell on the fringes of society .
so i thought this morning i would try to be the optimist , and give reason to hope for the future of the internet by drawing upon its present .
something amazing happened during this shoot .
now here &apos;s the even more striking thing .
so 100 years ago , hormones had just been discovered , and people hoped that hormone treatments were going to cure aging and disease , and now instead we set our hopes on stem cells , genetic engineering , and nanotechnology .
oncosearch was a good example .
so think about it .
ok , so as a matter of fact , child number one is telling the truth , child number two is lying .
i was gaunt . i walked as though my legs were wooden .
in fact , we call first year science and engineering , typically around america , weed-out courses or barrier courses .
so as soon as i see a question about things i &apos;m afraid of , which might be earthquakes , other religions , maybe i &apos;m afraid of terrorists or sharks , anything that makes me feel , assume you &apos;re going to exaggerate the problem .

to deal with contradictions , for example , they add branching patterns and parallel patterns .
it should imagine a user .
and i found myself in front of an hr manager in 1999 , saying something i never imagined that i would say .

and he explained that ebola threatened everything that made us human .
so then we tried a blend , and in a blend combination we tried it against h5n1 , and we got greater than 1,000 selectivity index .
and this is the kind of thing that i got back .
many of you may remember the magic wall that we built in conjunction with perceptive pixel where we quite literally create an infinite wall .
de : that &apos;s a great question . we actually have no idea what the theoretical limits are of what kind of data the brain can take in .
so in the technological world , we don &apos;t have experience to judge models .
i could talk to you about it right now if i wanted to , because it unlocked it .
the other reason why i really like this is because it offers an alternative entry point into the complexity of science .
i come from a family that doesn &apos;t have a whole lot of money .
we make assumptions about so-called disabilities .
once we fix it , we just might solve this problem .

you have the crude oil .
a little , tiny guy walks along . more servo drives , lots of servo hacking , lots of mechanical stuff .
management of forests , transportation , the oceans , the melting of the permafrost .
so we were in front of a strange new cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently .
( laughter ) the microbes that cover us .
it shows very well that eyes can hear , and this is interesting to me because technology allows us to present sound to the eyes in ways that accentuate the strength of the eyes for seeing sound , such as the removal of time .
and here was the most intriguing result : the task allocation .
i went to turin in may .
to understand all this , i interviewed a top official from the ruling party in turkey , and i ask him , &quot; &quot; how do you do it ? &quot; &quot; they too use digital technology extensively , so that &apos;s not it .

after the fourth rejection , we requested reconsideration of the manuscript , because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology .
i knew nothing about wofford and even less about methodism , but i was reassured on the first day that i taught at wofford college to find , among the auditors in my classroom , a 90-year-old hungarian , surrounded by a bevy of middle-aged european women who seemed to function as an entourage of rhinemaidens .
captive breeding will be a major part of bringing back these species .
the first question is , how did the number of deaths per year from natural disaster , how did that change during the last century ?
so the project is going very , very well , and i urge you to check out the website and watch this space .

the gas that they used at first , in many cases , was oxygen .
can we observe them taking place in the natural world ?
the nurses , anesthesiologist , the surgeon , all the assistants are waiting around .
if they did , it probably was right there at ground zero .
and i think there &apos;s almost a paradox with those .
but , in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries , our language isn &apos;t allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want , the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable .
we spend so much time in this culture being driven and aggressive , and i spend a lot of time being those things too .
we haven &apos;t even started the american stockpile .
the other piece of good news , for a scientist at least , is that much remains to be discovered .
what we mean when we say those things is : i see you there .
you know , you would ask patients questions and some people would tell you , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t , don &apos;t , don &apos;t listen to what the patients said . &quot; &quot; we know that patients know and understand their bodies better , but these days we &apos;re trying to divorce them from that idea . we have to reconcile the patient &apos;s knowledge of their body with physician &apos;s measurements .
so he doesn &apos;t actually do anything himself .
across my residual limb are electrodes that measure the electrical pulse of my muscles .
turns out it wasn &apos;t so easy .

this number exploded with the great recession , but it turns out people actually like living this way .
and you have to , first you have to convince yourself .
we can see that they travel different countries , so if you focus on a problem locally , it &apos;s not going to help you .

so we can throw it out like that . let &apos;s reset it .
do you know that it takes years for a drug to go from an idea to being tested on cells in a laboratory , to animal studies , to then clinical trials on humans , finally to go through a regulatory approval process , to be available for your doctor to prescribe to you ?

we began with a small literacy class to read the koran , then a math class , then an english class , then computer classes .

( clicks ) thank you .
the thing is , this idea of chinese-american food doesn &apos;t exist only in america .
some poems even tell you that that is what they can do .
let me talk about my own experience .
we &apos;re going to start and realize that the entire visible universe , everything we can see in every direction with the hubble space telescope plus our other instruments , was once in a region that was smaller than an atom .
it &apos;s a very trivial thing .
we don &apos;t know what the atmospheres of these planets are like because the planets are so small and dim compared to their stars and so far away from us .
and if everything goes smoothly , one to two weeks from now you &apos;ll know where the epidemic was today .
and so folks like ami klin have developed methods to be able to take infants , small babies , and be able to use biomarkers , in this case eye contact and eye tracking , to identify an infant at risk .
how about 40 ? okay , it &apos;s a whole varied response .
it all started when we at cern saw something intriguing in our data : a hint of a new particle , an inkling of a possibly extraordinary answer to this question .
in northern california , we &apos;re beginning to take observations with the first 42 telescopes of the allen telescope array — and i &apos;ve got to take a moment right now to publicly thank paul allen and nathan myhrvold and all the teamseti members in the ted community who have so generously supported this research .

he was a christian guy during the weekends , but during the week he was a scientist .
i love those experiments , but i think that the most profound and life-changing experiment that i &apos;ve done is my most recent experiment , where i spent a year trying to follow all of the rules of the bible , &quot; the year of living biblically . &quot;
what crazy person would pop their head through a glass ceiling ?
and he took schwarzschild &apos;s idea to the prussian academy of sciences the next week .
but this is not a very efficient way to organize a regulation of wealth dynamics .
so let me show you the scene , and then i basically used the trick that was identified by sergei eisenstein , which is , if you have a camera that &apos;s moving with a moving object , what is not moving appears to be moving , and what is moving appears to be stopped , so what you &apos;re actually seeing now is the train is not moving at all , and what is actually moving is the floor .
in this country , if we win the election , we are going to make all government spending over 25,000 pounds transparent and available online , searchable for anyone to see .
sooner or later , sooner or later , the rule of history is that where power goes governance must follow .
so really the resolution is quite incredible .
it shows a cockroach moving over incredibly rough terrain without tipping over , and it &apos;s able to do this because its legs are a combination of rigid materials , which is what we traditionally use to make robots , and soft materials .
and there are hints of this .
now this is a real project that we worked on , literally , you would not believe how hard .
if you are a bit short in mathematical skills , don &apos;t worry .
so here &apos;s the thing .
this time , there &apos;s new treatments on the horizon .
tackling social and environmental problems at the same time with the same solution yields great cost savings , wealth generation and national security .
if she fails , we &apos;re all headed to the gallows ; if she passes , we can leave to vietnam .

the game costs about 80 million dollars to make , so basically it pays for itself in about a month .
so i time-stamp my life every few moments .
what makes our story especially important is that we have learned so much from a group of students who are typically not at the top of the academic ladder — students of color , students underrepresented in selected areas .

now , at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists or physical anthropologists in the audience , basically there &apos;s not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups .

but they didn &apos;t think that those numbers were related to them .
we here inside the room , i believe that we have the same concern , and the model that we created in brazil , we can transplant it here .
so we know flowers , we know fruits and vegetables , even some alfalfa in hay that the livestock for the meats that we eat , rely on pollinators , but you &apos;ve got male and female parts to a plant here , and basically pollinators are attracted to plants for their nectar , and in the process , a bee will visit some flowers and pick up some pollen , or that male kind of sperm counterpart , along the way , and then travel to different flowers , and eventually an apple , in this case , will be produced .
it &apos;s just a design of pitches and silence and time .
of course , we know that we &apos;re going to get old .
so again , financial engineering was helpful here .
they can create a much happier life for billions towards the future .
and i ask you that because we are increasingly in one .
well , i plan my route so that i &apos;m drifting with the winds and the currents while i &apos;m sleeping .
and then we poll the public and see where they score worst .

khaled saeed was killed in june 2010 .
there is no kind of center where everything happens .
why ? because if they aren &apos;t seeing that , it could be a red flag that their organization isn &apos;t as aligned as it could potentially be .
the self that lives in the long narrative arc and the self that experiences the moment become one .
and it also involved new choices for leaders .
simple menus put on a board , achieving , kind of , the sort of balance .
it takes a long time to learn how to do that , and they excavated the area and they found that this material culture , this way of doing it , these rocks , had passed down for at least 4,300 years through 225 chimpanzee generations .
i haven &apos;t told many people this , but in my head , i &apos;ve got thousands of secret worlds all going on all at the same time .
heike moses : hello everyone , i &apos;m heike , and i think it just kills the intrinsic motivation , so in the respect that children , if they would like to read , you just take this incentive away in just paying them , so it just changes behavior .
and to my mind , the scientific method — trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it doesn &apos;t — is one of the great accomplishments of humanity .
they &apos;re normally backroom or basement hardware service providers , but they need to be elevated to software strategists .
he said , &quot; &quot; do you have any questions ? &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; just one , doc .

well , for animals that are trying to avoid predators by staying in the darkness , light can still be very useful for the three basic things that animals have to do to survive : and that &apos;s find food , attract a mate and avoid being eaten .
they didn &apos;t want to go to a componentized system .
the second is for continued population , human population expansion .
gambia : we went to select a grandmother in gambia .
and ultimately , we become more human .
it was a little over 100 years ago that beijerinck discovered viruses .
let &apos;s consider for a while the option of monotasking .
so that means that they can try out new stuff without the embarrassment of having to pay if it didn &apos;t work , which for still quite a lot of bits of government , that &apos;s a serious issue .
there are lots of small streets .
it was just , &quot; &quot; because i say so .
and after about 15 or 20 minutes of this , she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said , &quot; &quot; come on , bryan . you and i are going to have a talk . &quot; &quot; and i remember this just like it happened yesterday .
what may be more reprehensible , if climate denial continues , is extermination of species .
and the very structure of an affair , the fact that you can never have your lover , keeps you wanting .
i &apos;m going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet , and not in the traditional sense , not just the gay closet .
and that fascinated me , to explore that territory .
and if it stops us from noticing and fixing those problems , well , then that &apos;s really bad .
rather than preceding the insurgency , the taliban followed the troop deployment , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , the troop deployment caused their return .
so these are the three arguments that i &apos;m going to give you quickly today .
10 years ago there , were very few countries that received sovereign ratings from the standard &amp; poors , moody &apos;s and fitch &apos;s .
it &apos;s odd . it has a battery .

her cancer continued to grow .

this one came from the sulfur dioxide from mount pinatubo in 1991 — cooled the earth by half a degree .
and i also have a little bit of a sort of smartass subtitle to this .
anyhow , i &apos;ll end that there , and thank you very much .
instead of , like , copper in 10 or 15 .
it works just purely on its form .

there are four on-board micro-controllers that , each time this ring rotates it , as it passes the rear of the display , it picks up a position signal .
and this actually represented kind of a sea change to me .
it adjusts continually . and we removed the air conditioning .
they love them .
but the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now , but that things are already inevitably changing , and what we need to do is to work creatively with that , based on asking the right questions .
the second point , would you really buy a car just based on the advice of the dealer ?
yet we have this idea , we humans , that the earth — all of it : the oceans , the skies — are so vast and so resilient it doesn &apos;t matter what we do to it .

i drew the logo for citibank on a napkin in the first meeting .
and most of the time , you &apos;ll find this insect lives in and around your home , so this — whatever we do has got to get to that insect .
when we started this out , we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem , which is why we chose the smallest genome .
now the first step , pretty easy .
in fact , it was beginning , and the 23 years since is a story of acknowledgment , apology and atonement .
what about martin luther king ?
he blew himself up , killing six .
i would say , we should call ourselves coctivors — ( laughter ) from coquere , to cook .
so , scientists knew all of that already , but it still doesn &apos;t fully explain how natalia found one so far north .
am : so , these are the sprint legs , and i can put my other ...
and they said you have to say bye to her , you have to do what you have to do .
it &apos;s pretty amazing , isn &apos;t it ?
i mean , who &apos;s carrying around an electron microscope in their pocket ?
we need to know what they say they want , not what they want in their heart of hearts , not what they think they can get , but what they say they want , because that is a strategically chosen position , and we can work backwards from that to draw inferences about important features of their decision-making .
suppose a terrorist wants to blow up a building , and he wants to do this again and again in the future .
your brain is locked in a vault of silence and darkness inside your skull .
thanks very much , and give me your card and sometime we &apos;ll talk . &quot; &quot; i didn &apos;t know ebay from that jar of water sitting on that piano , but i had the presence of mind to go back and talk to one of the techie kids at my center .

we invited 10 of the top mars scientists to the langley research center for two days .
and the simple fact is , if we are focused on ourselves , if we &apos;re preoccupied , as we so often are throughout the day , we don &apos;t really fully notice the other .
and finally , in part because of technology , the world is incredibly flux at the moment .
that &apos;s how linked data works .
and that &apos;s how i &apos;ve discovered that if i feel what is in the story — in one story — then i come the closest , i think , to knowing what compassion is , to feeling that compassion .
probably because when we admit we can do something about it , we &apos;ve got to do something about it .
they develop a persona , a signature style , much like fashion designers .
there is nothing — but a nuclear war of a kind we &apos;ve never seen — that can stop this &#91; growth &#93; from happening .

she won with 75 percent of the vote .
this is from stanford &apos;s computer science 101 class , and the students are supposed to color-correct that blurry red image .
and one day i was exploring this cul-de-sac hidden away a few streets away .
we have the individual power to go , &quot; &quot; this is what i want to do . &quot; &quot; and in a pointless universe , that , to me , is a wonderful thing .
it &apos;s serving the purpose of illumination , but at the same time , we are able to transmit this data .
and then a funny thing happened — they sold .
( laughter ) i promise .
we figured out how to put a vapor-compression distiller on this thing , with a counter-flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat , then using a little bit of the electricity control that process , and for 450 watts , which is a little more than half of its waste heat , it will make 10 gallons an hour of distilled water from anything that comes into it to cool it .
and how far down into it you figure we &apos;ll have to scroll to get to the golden ticket ?
i never saw his face .
i was the youngest by at least a decade , but somehow the poets at the bowery poetry club didn &apos;t seem bothered by the 14-year-old wandering about .
this allows you to drag and drop these blocks of semantic code and create any behavior for this robot you want .
remember , i was young then .
what in the laboratory that i see out there , the laboratories of democracy , what has happened ?
the real issue in cellular biology is we are never going to understand everything , because it &apos;s a multidimensional problem put there by evolution .
that &apos;s why we are so scared about flu , isn &apos;t it ?
my inspiration comes from problems in my daily life .
i think it &apos;s time for the subject to go public .
i needed to go deeper .
and in 2011 , he was running a big campaign to address everyday corruption in india , a topic that indian elites love to ignore .
where does it lie on that chart ?
so , when i started this , i didn &apos;t have an overall plan for the machine , but i did have a sense of the gesture , and a sense of the shape and how it would occupy space .
and it &apos;s something i &apos;m very excited to be a part of .
peace piberesima : we &apos;re doing films for the masses .
as an evolutionary biologist , i &apos;d say this : our brains have evolved to help us survive within the orders of magnitude , of size and speed which our bodies operate at .
we get far more questions right on i.q. tests than each succeeding generation back to the time that they were invented .
the goal was to destroy secretly the self-confidence of people , for example by damaging their reputation , by organizing failures in their work , and by destroying their personal relationships .
and then in moments of high adrenaline , like when something exciting was happening , i would up that photographic frequency to as many as 37 photographs in five minutes .
and it &apos;s a brand new leadership challenge .
one of the things i did not stress in that introduction was that , systematically , the pace of life decreases as you get bigger .
and i was calling about how to make ajiaco . it &apos;s a cuban meal .
when we &apos;re turning , we have the feeling of surfing , and the way it &apos;s going up-wind , it &apos;s very efficient .
i started to prospect under the benches of bakeries and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points .

he got married . he had a son called jeremiah .
but there &apos;s a far worse danger confronting us .
i was hooked . i was hooked . ( laughter ) cold water was constantly on my mind , and from that point on , my career focused on these types of harsh and unforgiving environments , and it took me to places like russia , norway , alaska , iceland , chile , the faroe islands , and a lot of places in between .
so our cost for this was less than 10,000 dollars , all right .
income per person . i can put that here .
now these provisional structures have , in some cases , remained standing for the better part of a human lifetime .
so basically , you have a group of people who are excited by the idea .
i &apos;m not taking sides .
let me give you an example .
so , naturally , they chased him out of town .
here &apos;s the united states — considerably richer than new zealand , but with a lower level of social progress .

( laughter ) yesterday , the automotive guys gave us some new insights .
so if you go back about two and a half billion years , the earth was this big , sterile hunk of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around on it .
and here , here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the tanzanian giraffe .
like , hats off to south africa and turkey and israel and somalia and japan and gambia .
what if my roommate knew about the female lawyer who recently went to court in nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband &apos;s consent before renewing their passports ?
so that &apos;s idea one : recognize interdependence .

we actually need to bring all of our intelligence to becoming stupid again — clueless &#91; before &#93; the immensity of the unknown .
but the modality of attention , or what is happening today , what &apos;s happening tomorrow .
then , at the top , there is a before and an after image of the landing .
so what can we do about that ? what can we say ?
on the other hand , we don &apos;t know how to accommodate it into our scientific view of the world .
wipe it up , throw it away .
pretty clever , right ?
basically they went to the ballot boxes to tell that they have nobody to vote for .
special olympics is transforming their lives off the field .
when the room smelled gross , what we saw was that individuals actually reported more negative attitudes toward gay men .
and i &apos;m not even sure we know what technology is .
they were identical except for one thing .
we parse it out on an as-needed basis , sometimes for very good reasons , other times just because we don &apos;t understand the gaps in our lives .
i had them keep track of their time for a week so i could add up how much they worked and slept , and i interviewed them about their strategies , for my book .
i would not let an adult drive my robot .
what if you had no access to public libraries ?
one , two , three and four .
we know that the brain is capable of extraordinary change , and the best way to achieve that , even in adults , is to change and modulate our environment .
so thank you .
i &apos;m here to talk about very real killer robots , autonomous combat drones .
it &apos;s 350 people on the committee for oklahoma city , which is why we thought of this as a sort of ad-hoc , spontaneous solution that expanded on union square and the places that were ad-hoc memorials in the city already .
there &apos;s an anteroom with photographs of children who perished and then you come into a large space .
and basically , it &apos;s a system made of two components — a sensing and an actuating component .
ma : i think we &apos;re slowly changing , but obviously there are whole pockets in countries where nothing is different .
foremost among them is the exorbitant cost of sending money home .
for example , true story : just a few weeks ago , this cab driver , upon finding out that a friend and i were in town for a game developers &apos; conference , turned around and said — and i quote — &quot; &quot; i hate games . waste of life .
think about this for a second .
as long as these devices are there , or there is suspicion of landmines , you can &apos;t really enter into the land .
it has a tail . and just when you think you &apos;ve figured out nature , this kind of thing happens .
( laughter ) my company , called freelance programmers , and that &apos;s precisely what it was , couldn &apos;t have started smaller : on the dining room table , and financed by the equivalent of 100 dollars in today &apos;s terms , and financed by my labor and by borrowing against the house .
i &apos;m going to talk to you today about hopefully converting fear into hope .
so this is a local person potentially deciding whether to enter the babysitting market .
be aware of these people who &#91; are &#93; coming to you in order to ruin your great civilization . &quot; &quot; fortunately , people right now cannot be deceived .
we know now that that is not the case because of the greenhouse gases that coal produces .
and yet the politicization of never again , the operationalization of never again , had never occurred in the 20th century .
we &apos;re all mammals here , we all have a lot of neural and hormonal programming that makes us really bond with others , care for others , feel compassion for others , especially the weak and vulnerable .
dh : i think so , that &apos;s right .
and we make the machine meet them half way .
and because working in a store was so hard , i liked going to school ; it was like heaven .
and they &apos;re totally emotionally excited about the fact that they walk around thinking of themselves as a creative person .
but also it &apos;s part of being any monthly magazine — you live in the future . and we have a long lead-time .
( laughter ) i &apos;m teasing you , sweetheart . no , i &apos;m comfortable with any question .
everything we blog , everything we tweet , and everything we click is a public act of making media .
not just with their puppy , but with the rest of the family at class .
if you read a book , pull things up .
before most kids are 12 , they &apos;ll have been to disney world more times than they &apos;ve been in a canoe or camping under a starry sky .
governments executed people for frivolous reasons , like stealing a cabbage or criticizing the royal garden .
so the five of us , two americans , two italians and a spaniard , we — ( laughter ) you know , it &apos;s a worldwide project . ( laughter ) so we came together in this design institute called the interaction design institute ivrea , which was teaching interaction design , this idea that you can take design from the simple shape of an object and you can move it forward to design the way you interact with things .
ab : 987 squared is 974,169 .
and it was then that i thought back to my jittery hands .
i have worked with more than 500 companies .
can i tell you how un-canadian that is ?
so what do you do with a dead mall , dead office park ?
do we really believe that god is the kind of male boss that we &apos;ve been presenting in our worship and in our liturgies over all these years ?
and we have a lot of it sitting around , because this is a big problem .
azuri , hi , how are you doing ?
here &apos;s an ad in the new york times somebody did for a play called &quot; &quot; mind games . &quot; &quot; then &quot; &quot; chicago &quot; &quot; came out , used similar graphics , and the public theater &apos;s identity was just totally eaten and taken away , which meant i had to change it .
this change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in africa , and they allowed us to start to expand around the world .
here , this is a protocell , and it &apos;s vigorously shedding this skin .
but i really believe that a fully operating , rich society needs these seeds coming from all directions and all disciplines in order to keep the gears of inspiration and imagination flowing and cycling and growing .
it has curves in two directions , one curve upward and opposite transverse curve down the other , so any kind of perturbation spreads the forces over the surface of this type of shape .
and it &apos;s apparently okay to marry a boy from georgia , but not to have hair from texas .
and the umbrella campaign was &quot; &quot; thank god it &apos;s monday . &quot; &quot; so , we tried to take this — what was perceived as a negative : their over-competitiveness , their , you know , long working hours — and turn it into a positive and not run from it .
if they have a hip fracture we go with them and we study their entire discharge experience .
so i couldn &apos;t handle it .
still exists back home .
&quot; &quot; it is a pity , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; that the police in this country are not tough enough on bad drivers . &quot; &quot; i was baffled .
or should they not ?
80 percent of africans still rely on traditional medicine .
if you can use jelly to make a robot — now , we eat jelly , right ?
so in the morning , in between six and seven in the morning , the body is then transported inside of the body bag to our center and is being scanned through one of the ct scanners .
the participants at improv everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other new yorkers , they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way .
and i thought like , &quot; &quot; wow . i &apos;m like , living in a science fiction movie .
and what we &apos;re seeing is , can we expand the human umvelt so that he comes to have , after several weeks , a direct perceptual experience of the economic movements of the planet .
einstein once said , &quot; &quot; logic will get you from a to b.
and i did one that was about 35 feet long .
that &apos;s where i live , and it &apos;s my university as well .
in the lab , we get people to come to the lab , sit in front of a computer screen , and we give them little tasks that i &apos;m going to get you to do again .
so you can see that the fibers wrap in helices , and those fibers can reorient as the skeleton moves , which means the skeleton &apos;s flexible .
they are my heroes and my father is my hero , who understood democracy and guided me through it .
these vibrios , these bacteria , can actually infect people .
think of the expense , the human cost of that .
we should be angry , because this is wrong , and it &apos;s rude , and it should not be done .
not because it &apos;s a job , not because it &apos;s a career , but because it &apos;s a calling .
you can stay with me for 20 years , go tomorrow .
we &apos;re talking about a pick , pack and ship setting here .
noise becomes music .
a country like america has four times the amount of food that it needs .
and as you know , everybody loves that , too .
as weeks of deprivation stretched into months , some resorted to eating tulip bulbs .
or does somebody want to run a marathon , or does somebody want to ballroom dance ?
so what i &apos;m going to do is , every now and again , i will make this gesture , and in a moment of powerpoint democracy , you can imagine what you &apos;d like to see .
well , we used to use trampettes . in the old days , that &apos;s all they had .
we &apos;re going to then apply one of those stains to it , and we scan it .
you could regain this time .
the mind , our most valuable and precious resource , through which we experience every single moment of our life .
and that &apos;s more or less the story of the coral reefs of the caribbean , and increasingly , tragically , the coral reefs worldwide .
( laughter ) you know , that &apos;s what you call a lead . ( laughter )
and these are sometimes unsafe places to send our sickest patients , especially in an era of superbugs and hospital-acquired infections .
how are we going to find these planets ?
think about it with the corexit hitting the membranes , and it will clog up the gills , and then these animals are going to be getting something like what you call chemical pneumonia , trying to aspirate the compounds .
granted , we &apos;re not sending humans up at the moment , well at least with our own launch vehicles , but nasa is far from dead , and one of the reasons why we write a program like this is so that people realize that there &apos;s so many other things that we &apos;re doing .
this is still not really ideal for research , though , because it &apos;s not entirely clear where all of these passwords came from , or exactly what policies were in effect when people created these passwords .
get yourself a fat reward . life &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; i can &apos;t do it .
i &apos;m a contemporary artist and i show in art galleries and museums .
and portland is not alone here .
i know many well-intentioned non-muslims who &apos;ve begun reading the koran , but given up , disconcerted by its &quot; &quot; otherness . &quot; &quot; the historian thomas carlyle considered muhammad one of the world &apos;s greatest heroes , yet even he called the koran &quot; &quot; as toilsome reading as i ever undertook , a wearisome , confused jumble . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) part of the problem , i think , is that we imagine that the koran can be read as we usually read a book — as though we can curl up with it on a rainy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn within reach , as though god — and the koran is entirely in the voice of god speaking to muhammad —
so essentially , the shape of the building that you &apos;re born into is the shape of the structure which carries you to your ancestral resting place .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s , since it was invented a year or two ago , has given me untold happiness .
we did not prioritize right .
we call it &quot; &quot; liquid lead dancing . &quot; &quot; jf : let &apos;s try this with a latin dance , salsa .
we want to strike a balance where they have the freedom to do anything but not a lot of money showered on them so they could go out and do nothing .
people here get very confused about what a punishment is .
we need women to work . we need working women to have babies .
so what we find is that there is this great deal of wasted crisis information because there is just too much information for us to actually do anything with right now .
what does this all mean ?
it is this fear that &apos;s feeding the diet industry , which is keeping so many of us from making peace with our own bodies , for waiting to be the after-photo before we truly start to live our lives .
how cheap ?
we got dirty , and we loved it .
so that &apos;s what i do . i study color a lot .
this is a book written by a consummate player by the name of kevin carroll .
after finishing his bedtime rituals , he looked at me and he asked a question : &quot; mommy , are we bad people ? &quot;
and these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid .
and we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places .
and they look like this . they &apos;re basically very simple arrangements .
we are always doing things we like in our life .
by definition the outcome is outside of our control , and if that &apos;s where we spend all of our emotional energy , we are going to get drained as we do .
and i thought , you know , what were they thinking ?
unconsciously , a concert will be connected to a brush and a roulette game will be connected to a hat .
and so we know that , for example , openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success , but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and , occasionally , odd .
dh : please stand up , richard . ( whip cracks ) oh , sorry . ( laughter ) dh : now richard , please ... ( whip cracks ) bf : ok , sorry .
this was a work made by mike tyka in our group , which he calls &quot; &quot; animal parade . &quot; &quot; it reminds me a little bit of william kentridge &apos;s artworks , in which he makes sketches , rubs them out , makes sketches , rubs them out , and creates a movie this way .
and i put 100 million cells in his cisterna magna , in his lumbar cord , and filled out the irbs and did all this work , and i never really knew .
sk : so that &apos;s the final element in it that just makes it that much more ridiculous , that there is a flag design within the milwaukee flag .
but maybe they have another faculty , something else that would seem equally irrational to us , but they actually tap into some great possible value there .
there are actually a wave of startups like connect.me and legit and trustcloud that are figuring out how you can aggregate , monitor and use your online reputation .
♫ just a little rain , just a little rain , just a little rain ♫ ♫ i want what i can &apos;t have , need what i can &apos;t want ♫ ♫ have what i don &apos;t have , what i want ♫ ♫ what i can &apos;t have , need what i can &apos;t want ♫ ♫ have but i don &apos;t have ♫ ♫ my mind won &apos;t stop , and my heart says go ♫ ♫ nobody knows how to hold me ♫ ♫ my mind won &apos;t stop , and my heart says , ♫ ♫ &quot; &quot; good things come to those who wait &quot; &quot; ♫ ♫ and i can &apos;t stand in ... ♫
maybe even find a tumor , in some cases .
a hundred companies , we can work with .
so we &apos;re seeing there &apos;s a real extension of middle age .
so i actually went to school in belfast , which was where all the action happened .
in the andes , this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city .
( laughter ) i later had a child , after getting married , and i was living essentially the egyptian-american dream .
i &apos;m going to tell you five facts about myself .
thank you .
there is the beijing olympic games coming in august 2008 , and it &apos;s very clear that the chinese government is controlling the economy and doing what it takes to also avoid any wave and control the stock market . &quot; &quot; three weeks after my presentation , the markets lost 20 percent and went through a phase of volatility , upheaval , and a total market loss of 70 percent until the end of the year .
and they &apos;re big mountains , thousands of feet tall , some of which are tens of thousands of feet and bust through the surface , creating islands like hawaii .
well , the question of origins , as with so many other questions in biology , seems to have been answered by darwin over a century ago .
i learned so much about myself .
true aliens , stocks that arrived from outer space .
you see india , you see brazil .
so as you can guess , my mother tongue is french .
which kind of delivered the answer , which i couldn &apos;t really answer , which is , &quot; &quot; what do i do with my life ? &quot; &quot; i love diplomacy — i have no career — i expected my entire life to be a diplomat , to be serving my country .
and these women would get together and just talk .
my wife , yvonne , and i , we have four kids , three grown ones and a 15-year-old .
after 12 days of storm i get to row for four hours without a flagging wind .
sophal ear : so , notwithstanding the 1970s narration , on april 17th 1975 we lived in phnom penh .
everything i was looking at seemed like it was going to kill me , but i couldn &apos;t explain why .
one more time .
but it didn &apos;t lead to the exceptional results that they were hoping for .
europe of and by the people , a europe , an experiment in deepening and widening democracy beyond borders .
and we calculated several scenarios , and the picture always looked like this .
it &apos;s a place where families can stay together to enjoy quality time with their children , many of whom are there for respite stays , some with repeated visits over a span of many years .
it can happen that these two protons can hop over .
we tend to think of emotions as just feelings .
and when it is full , it is blocked and it can go to the next .
after six days , thomas died in ross &apos;s arms surrounded by our family .
they clung to certainty in the belief that doubt would undermine them .
and i &apos;m going to show a video of the older version of it , which is just a minute long . okay .
as a matter of fact , i think a lot of my design ideas come from mistakes and tricks of the eye .
she did so much . she was a playwright .
it &apos;s one part of the form and content .
( laughter ) and with this rationale , i look at these days and i think , i &apos;m not retired . i don &apos;t feel retired at all .
now language &apos;s subversive power has been recognized throughout the ages in censorship , in books you can &apos;t read , phrases you can &apos;t use and words you can &apos;t say .
how many here would say that casey martin does have a right to use a golf cart ?
then we thought that the earth is the unmoving center of reality because it looks that way .
it &apos;s a little bit like the invasion of the body snatchers .
in this hypothetical circumstance , this civilization would have exhausted the energy supply of their home planet , so where could they get more energy ?
and so i began to sort of mess with the computer at the time .
eve , first woman .
but the question is , does this matter to babies in how they treat the puppets ? and it matters a lot .
in 2012 , we entered the competition for the angelini innovation center , and the aim was to build the right environment for knowledge creation .
they &apos;ve found small objects such as these .
and that &apos;s not the only leopards that were being killed through that period .
and then , after they get that care — like the mouse , like the skier , like the 65-year-old woman — they &apos;ll wake up .
so we &apos;re really entering the era of wearable robotics actually .
there &apos;s lots of businesses that would like to locate in the americas , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there &apos;s lots of people who &apos;d like to go there .
and the same is true for the troops .
and one of the things i really like about open source is it really allows different people to work together .
these big issues that will change the world , change national security , change economics , create hope , create threats , can only be resolved when you bring together groups of people who understand science and technology back together with government .
so you have what &apos;s called the xenon pit , and so some of these fission products love neutrons .
around that time i met an extraordinary human being , peter thum , who inspired me with his actions .
i was afraid that people would see me for who i really was , that i wasn &apos;t the perfect , popular kid in high school everyone thought i was , that beneath my smile , there was struggle , and beneath my light , there was dark , and beneath my big personality just hid even bigger pain .
&#91; the civil war in syria may seem far away &#93; &#91; until you experience it yourself . &#93; ( girl singing ) ( explosion ) &#91; project syria &#93; &#91; a virtual reality experience &#93; np : we were then invited to take the piece to the victoria and albert museum in london .
the time is now for us to show them fairness , and we can do that , you and i , by starting where we work , in the businesses that we operate in .
honeybee robotics designed the mars driller , and it was really very much fun to work with them .
we decided to do something a little bit different and transform flavors that were very familiar — so in this case , we have carrot cake .
it becomes more and more and more expensive to dig them out .
what i found incredibly astonishing and so motivational was that these families were so motivated to support their children .
( laughter ) ( applause ) there is obviously einstein , niels bohr , de fermat &apos;s last theorem , and i &apos;m not sure whether that &apos;s james coburn or richard harris . ( laughter )
( laughter ) ilkka hanski was an ecologist in finland , and he did this experiment himself .
in a survey , 74 percent of women said that miscarriage , they felt , was partly their fault , which is awful .
in fact , this is the score for dan &apos;s piece , completely composed by dan in hyperscore .
and my first car was a 1975 electric-green mustang .
this is called &quot; &quot; i &apos;m an emotional creature . &quot; &quot; and it happened because i met a girl in watts , l.a.
i question the entire premise of this piece , but i &apos;m always interested in hearing what they &apos;ve come up with before they call me .
( applause ) chris anderson : so , ashraf , until recently , you were the finance minister of afghanistan , a country right at the middle of much of the world &apos;s agenda .
a caterpillar &apos;s mouth .
today , their share has more than doubled to above 20 percent .
and i put a piece of tape around it , as you see there , and realized you could sit on it , and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on .
he ruled the country with an iron fist , and anyone who dared question his authority was arrested , tortured , jailed or even killed .
all we are left with is the skeleton , if you will , of the liver , all made up of collagen , a material that &apos;s in our bodies , that will not reject .
you can actually see the point when i know what i &apos;m doing , and a lot of light and dark comes into it .
holy cow ! that &apos;s just amazing .
and sooner or later , we &apos;re going to have to accept the fact that health care innovation can &apos;t always come at a much higher price .
but we can make it possible for most .
so these simple projections of the goldman sachs type are not telling us what we need to know about power transition .
in the context of this broad range of digital relations , safely seeking strangeness might very well be a new basis for that innovation .
who loves the wedding almost as much as the bride ?
and the way to it , for me , was through artistic means .
and she also got books for herself .
the first thing i learned that day was that i never ever wanted to work that hard again .
how are they connected , and what does that global conversation look like ?
these beautiful illustrations are then shut back into the pages of a medical textbook , or an app , referenced only when needed .
so one of these works is the &quot; &quot; spelling spider . &quot; &quot; so the spelling spider is a cousin of the spelling bee .
i &apos;m going to give you some building blocks and they &apos;re nonrectilinear cactus building blocks , so it &apos;s totally legit . &quot; &quot; but he doesn &apos;t really know what to do with these .
why are we conscious ?
okay , now i promised you to tell you some of the outrageous things said about consciousness .
as much as we know , there is so much more that we don &apos;t know , and so i invite all of you to be able to help us think about how to do this better , to use as a community our collective wisdom to be able to make a difference , and in particular , for the individuals in families with autism , i invite you to join the interactive autism network , to be part of the solution to this , because it &apos;s going to take really a lot of us to think about what &apos;s important , what &apos;s going to be a meaningful difference .
so i thought , why don &apos;t we get into that business ?
or perhaps an ordinary person like you or me ?
and these hands were influenced by this man , mr. inami naomi .
they need an inclusive process where the real fabric of this very complicated society can deal with their issues .
some of my hypotheses are that when you first think about skeletal muscle , there &apos;s a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle .
( applause ) thank you .
unaids tell us that the hiv rate in zambia is 20 percent , and mortality estimates suggest it &apos;s only about 5 percent .
i had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end .
it &apos;s also very biologically active , as anyone with hay fever will understand .
now this is an extremely complicated subject , in part because the things that we call beautiful are so different .
and what you don &apos;t see in this picture is that somewhere between these riders there , there &apos;s a teenager sitting on a rock , saying , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m not moving from here . forget it .
so you &apos;d just see her feet .
or are there deeper structural factors that have led us to where we are today ?
don &apos;t want it to leave me behind . &quot; &quot; and from all around as people started singing and answering back , he sang : &quot; &quot; good news , good news : chariot &apos;s coming .
in a small country that could be my country , but could be also your country , they took a decision — it is a real case story — that all of the governmental decisions , discussions of the council of ministers , were going to be published on the internet 24 hours after the council discussions took place .
having spent 18 years as a child of the state in children &apos;s homes and foster care , you could say that i &apos;m an expert on the subject , and in being an expert , i want to let you know that being an expert does in no way make you right in light of the truth .
when they kept this under wraps , but soon others got to know .
the other week , i went on one of these sites , appropriately called swaptree , and there were over 59,300 items that i could instantly swap for my copy of &quot; &quot; 24 . &quot; &quot; lo and behold , there in reseda , ca was rondoron who wanted swap his or her &quot; like new &quot; copy of &quot; sex and the city &quot; for my copy of &quot; &quot; 24 . &quot; &quot; so in other words , what &apos;s happening here is that swaptree solves my carrying company &apos;s sugar rush problem , a problem the economists call &quot; &quot; the coincidence of wants , &quot; &quot; in approximately 60 seconds .
i &apos;ve had a grenade thrown at my office .
how are we going to do these attacks ?
so at the end of it , we concluded that groups of children can learn to use computers and the internet on their own , irrespective of who or where they were .
because our dental anatomy is actually made , not for tearing down raw meat from bones or chewing fibrous leaves for hours .
so what &apos;s going on ?
and some of these patients played a video game where they drive around a small town .
so , if you ’ re designing an interaction between two people — such as , i don ’ t know — ordering food at a fast food joint or something , you need to be able to imagine how that experience might feel over a period of time .
it was astonishing . they were also producing mangroves in a plantation .
we don &apos;t live to eat and make money .
the great hall at the met is one of the great portals of the world , awe-inspiring , like a medieval cathedral .
six hours later , up goes the temperature .
so now it &apos;s going from fish and sharks into reptiles , which , again , this is only one month old , but it shows us that we know almost nothing about this hawksbill turtle &apos;s vision .
and fish are much more interesting than corals , because they have really advanced vision , and some of the fish even have , the way that i was photographing it , they have lenses in their eyes that would magnify the fluorescence .
they put it on fire . it was boiling hot , getting ready to give to the kids .
that &apos;s 127 rides per second , showing that this is a cross-cultural phenomenon .
and i studied very much in sweden .
the phones just aren &apos;t ringing about the people . &quot; &quot; and the reason i give you this moment is there &apos;s a deep truth in it .
to take the example of migration , we know that immigration is a net positive for the economy as a whole under almost all circumstances .
your brain does a lot of its work behind the scenes , and that is a good thing , because your conscious mind — how do we put this politely ? — it &apos;s easily distracted .
so for the partner who had the affair , for nick , one thing is to end the affair , but the other is the essential , important act of expressing guilt and remorse for hurting his wife .
now it should be clear by now that this book is in bad condition .
it &apos;s the kind of original movement for any puppet for us onstage .
they &apos;re closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason , and i believe we shouldn &apos;t tolerate that either .
when we think about why we hear , we don &apos;t often think about the ability to hear an alarm or a siren , although clearly that &apos;s an important thing .
it &apos;s about how do you create a new product or develop a new product or manufacture a new product , but not a new product itself ?
now , i became a psychologist to help mitigate human suffering , and for the past 10 years , my target has been the suffering caused by ptsd , as experienced by veterans like carlos .
first of all , if you can , don &apos;t fight the patent , fight the infringement .
zero became a person and not just a character in a play .
now , in 2010 , the australian national university did an experiment where they sent out 4,000 identical applications to entry level jobs , essentially .
so she now works full-time on this for very little pay .
thank you .
second is salicornia bigelovii . very difficult to get around the world .
&quot; drugs are fun in the beginning but become a drag later on . &quot;
and when someone accesses your medical record , a research doctor , they could see , you could see which doctor accessed it and why , and you could maybe learn about what conditions you have .
i read a dictionary . i got into college .
when food was scarce , our ancestors &apos; survival depended on conserving energy , and regaining the weight when food was available would have protected them against the next shortage .
and if we do that , we &apos;re going to stop seeing cities as big , metropolitan , unproductive blobs , like this .
ca : five years ago you had an idea . what was that ?
sebastian : draw thy sword .
i am a neuroscientist with a mixed background in physics and medicine .
we can recover sounds from other objects , like plants .
you must be tolerant .
there was another unusual boat out there at the same time , doing as i was doing , bringing awareness to the north pacific garbage patch , that area in the north pacific about twice the size of texas , with an estimated 3.5 million tons of trash in it , circulating at the center of that north pacific gyre .
so she goes from oxford , she &apos;s sent to the north of england to a mother and baby home , and appointed a social worker .
we all want to share our stories , whether it is the trick we saw at the party , the bad day at the office or the beautiful sunset we saw on vacation .
and then she gets in her root-beer colored 1994 cadillac seville , and tears down the san bernardino freeway , where she still volunteers for seven different organizations .
and we did not know that u.s. intelligence agencies go to extremes such as infiltrating standardization bodies to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose .
so how do we test that ? well , that &apos;s easy .

these families had been through what we had been watching on the tv .
my neck was so stiff i couldn &apos;t touch my chin to my chest , and the slightest sound — the rustling of the sheets , my husband walking barefoot in the next room — could cause excruciating pain .
and we set ourselves a goal of turning the continent green .
and my claim is that mathematics has to do with patterns .
i think that &apos;s part of what the complexity of architecture is .
what do they tell us ?
and then it got stranger .
and japan is trying to move up there .
these places , these origins , represent governance gaps .
but as i said earlier , this kind of logic applies across the board for infectious diseases , and it ought to .
horses &apos; hearing is very important .
you stop by a wall , and start painting on that wall .
we had relay races with condoms , we had children &apos;s condom-blowing championship .
so we at the hebrew university , about 10 years ago , decided to focus on probably the most important biomaterial for humans , which is collagen .
the ripples of the personal dna revolution may be hard to predict , but one thing is certain : revolutions don &apos;t go backwards , and dna technology is already spreading faster than our imagination .
i think it would be interesting to see what everyone did with a project like this .
it &apos;s a dream . and it became a dream also .
this is data from the congressional budget office showing its most realistic forecast of what would happen if current situations and expectations and trends are extended .
sunlight is the best disinfectant .
it motivates me to make sure that i stay on the right path .
i &apos;m showing here venus , earth and mars — three planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size , but only one of which is really a good place to live .
i think it &apos;s extremely important that we have sustainable transport and sustainable energy production .
now , i should pause and say , what do i mean by puzzle ?
as he said , i was co-inventor of the furby .
well it allowed you to do that .
this is morocco last year in the atlas mountains , training in preparation for some high altitude jumps .
primates emerge from jungles , as tarsiers first , becoming lemurs not much later .
and those are frozen solid , and they &apos;re shipped to seattle .
( applause ) from malta , madagascar , thailand , vietnam , jordan , egypt , israel , as far north as alaska and as far south as new zealand .
what &apos;s ended up happening over the past few decades is the kind of coverage that you had as a head of state or as a great celebrity is now being applied to you every day by all these people who are tweeting , blogging , following you , watching your credit scores and what you do to yourself .
sand , water , all the equipment we don &apos;t need anymore .
now my husband , chris , and i love this show .
that is , you have to decide what that other person expects of you .
thank you .
finally , there &apos;s one of evening primrose that bjorn rorslett from norway sent me — fantastic hidden pattern .
but i wasn &apos;t there for nine months at a time like the filipino seafarers , who , when i asked them to describe their job to me , called it &quot; &quot; dollar for homesickness . &quot; &quot; they had good salaries , but theirs is still an isolating and difficult life in a dangerous and often difficult element .
what it &apos;s all about is the selective representations of things that are important to the brain .
the animal could be a cow , lamb , or even something more exotic .
put that another way — of all of them who test positive — so here they are , the individuals involved — less than one in 100 actually have the disease .
and then there &apos;s this one : &quot; if there &apos;s grass on the field , play ball . &quot;
he &apos;s one of more than 175 so-called terrorists , for whom the fbi has created hollywood endings .
i think this film is one of the hardest watches of modern times , &quot; &quot; the road . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a beautiful piece of filmmaking , but everything is desolate , everything is dead .
so over the 200 years of whaling , when we were busy killing and removing these carcasses from the oceans , we likely altered the rate and geographic distribution of these whale falls that would descend into deep oceans , and as a result , probably led to a number of extinctions of species that were most specialized and dependent on these carcasses for their survival .
and i &apos;m not saying there was no pair-bonding going on .
president obama understands that .
women are especially vulnerable to recruitment malpractices .
but the problem with relying on rules and incentives is that they demoralize professional activity , and they demoralize professional activity in two senses .
my mental illness — well , i &apos;m not even going to talk about my mental illness .
whether it be a mother , a daughter , a sister , a friend or a grandmother .
this pig at 10 : 06 was having a heart attack .
there are three featured in the film .
information visibility drives efficiency .
and in this , you &apos;d have like a — something that looks like a cloud , and it is a cloud at the same time .
i photographed him at the scene of the crime at the snake river in idaho .
so here &apos;s the thing . it sounds like a simple question .
but it &apos;s the best music making , like this .
or the sensual feeling .
then i thought , &quot; &quot; wait a minute , what am i doing ? &quot; &quot; a book is not only a neat way of collecting and storing information , it &apos;s a series of layers .
&quot; &quot; a maimed monument and a maimed mall for a maimed collection . &quot; &quot; almost four decades later , how will this building expand for a new progressive program ?
so that was the low-fear group .
but that would sort of be jumping to the middle of the story , and i &apos;m not going to show you that polished video .
we can see everything on wikipedia .
first , i &apos;m going to fly you over the rings .
and they all seemed to be ok .
so if you give just to one side or the other , you &apos;ll have tension or friction .
some of the organisms see all of the reality , others see just part of the reality , and some see none of the reality , only fitness .
calvin washington was convicted of capital murder .
but actually , the most exciting part of this new manufacturing revolution goes much beyond productivity .
we &apos;re going to do it non-invasively using mri .
but she ate it .
and one of those i &apos;d like to share with you today .
we have the tendency for people to go for 50 dollars now over waiting a month , but not if that decision is far in the future .
( laughter ) i recommend you all do this .
both parties know exactly what the speaker means , and the speaker knows the listener knows that the speaker knows that the listener knows , etc . , etc .

imagine you &apos;re learning to play tennis and you want to decide where the ball is going to bounce as it comes over the net towards you .
but i &apos;d heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time , so how did the good and bad go together ?
the dark side of the web is allergic to the light .
i mixed them up , heated them , cooled them down , and i got 50 billion little smiley faces floating around in a single drop of water .
and then i was also surprised by the city &apos;s propensity for kindness and care as opposed to indifference or worse .
now we may think that &apos;s good or bad , but in either case it &apos;s real .
ah , avaricious heaven !
i think this one here , there &apos;s a pop song that really describes philippe starck for me , you know , this is like you know , this is like puppy love , you know , this is cool right ?
i can &apos;t tell , nor can any of our algorithms , but in the case of a driver assistance system , that means it can &apos;t take action , because again , if it presses the brakes unexpectedly , that &apos;s completely unacceptable .
in the past , before air conditioning , we had thick walls .
and overlying this is the skin drape , which is a hugely complex three-dimensional structure — taking right-angled bends here and there , having thin areas like the eyelids , thick areas like the cheek , different colors .
the phantasmagoria , the actual experience that we try to understand and organize through narrative , varies from place to place .
thank you .

this is my collaborator ryota kanai .
my name is rashid , and i never been at ted before , you know what i &apos;m saying .
not only that , but some really bad scientists want to do some experiments on him , and they &apos;re looking for him .
many of you don &apos;t think of this yet , but the ocean will be in your pocket .
and i was actually rowing for my school here until this fateful day , and i flipped over right in front of the entire school .
and i sought out the most remote places .
moreover , once we can do that , we can actually activate specific neurons or we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those neurons .
and i feel like i &apos;m actually depriving them of information by telling them this , at which point i usually panic and spit out the first thing that comes to my mind , which is , i have no idea what i &apos;m doing .
meds don &apos;t equal medical care .
my job is to actually make sure that we make progress on all of these disorders .
exploring with them the forest canopy has been one of the most lovely things of my existence on earth .
i normally teach courses on how to rebuild states after war .
and even so , you can still see the shadows of these great beasts in our current ecosystems .
thank you .
they want to hunker down , they want to look to the future .
but that &apos;s changed .
and the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
slightly embarrassing admission : even when i was a kid , i used to have these little spy books , and i would , like , see what everybody was doing in my neighborhood and log it down .
but the challenge is , again , they don &apos;t get much value , because they can &apos;t afford anything more than the scooter .
designs were refined and developed with 150 older people and their families before the service was launched earlier this year .
but just the technological savings in heavy trucks can get to two-thirds .
there was no one there to look at treatment approaches .
do you remember , 20 years ago , no one had ever heard of west nile fever ?
we landed with 40 kilos .
what am i doing with the architecture ?
and how much will these samples be worth ?
this is actually a picture of the printing mechanism for another machine of his , called the difference engine no. 2 , which he never built , but which the science museum did build in the &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s .
we &apos;ve been around as homo sapiens — that &apos;s a rather generous definition , sapiens — for perhaps a quarter of a million years , a quarter of a million .
it happens . right ?
you and i — even you in the back — we live in three dimensions of space .
which is also increased when we &apos;re with our women friends .
i was active in the youth ministry .
right now , profounder &apos;s right at the very beginning , and it &apos;s very palpable ; it &apos;s very clear to me , that it &apos;s just a vessel , it &apos;s just a tool .
there is lots of showing off .
but finding me busy , she fled , with the dawn .
well , in this , there &apos;s personalization all the way .
but instead of having constant accidental or mindless interruptions , we &apos;re now only creating conscious interruptions , so we &apos;re doing two things here .
( music ) but , what if ...
for multiple defenders , we can look at how the player &apos;s moving and predict the shot type .
well , if you take the informational , panpsychist view , she certainly has complicated information processing and integration , so the answer is very likely yes , she is conscious .
and we had this mantra : &quot; human . kind . be both . &quot;
a great way to start , i think , with my view of simplicity is to take a look at ted . here you are , understanding why we &apos;re here , what &apos;s going on with no difficulty at all .
that &apos;s because it &apos;s cheaper .
unfortunately , this is often lacking or inefficient in a lot of developing countries .
and i was driving home from work , and a truck was coming the opposite direction , came over into my lane , ran over the top of my car and his axle tore my arm off .
you look busy . how are you ?
it has no meaning , just — desoto discovers the mississippi , and it &apos;s a desoto discovering the mississippi .
actually any primate will do that .
and how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality .
and so , together with my colleagues , i &apos;ve called for a global conversation about the technology that i co-invented , so that we can consider all of the ethical and societal implications of a technology like this .
you can see it in the way we raise our young kids .
and instead that money went to underwrite the wars in yugoslavia and line the pockets of unscrupulous individuals .
tell my wife i love her very much she knows . &quot; &quot; ground control to major tom , your circuit &apos;s dead , there &apos;s something wrong .
( applause ) you have to separate fact from bias , right .
and that &apos;s going to impact how it &apos;s going to evolve .
we &apos;re going to share lots of things with people , but nothing &apos;s going to happen until we risk putting those ideas into action .
and that this , of course , one of the themes for us is that we think that candor and brutal honesty is critical to us collectively being great parents .
enjoying it so far ? ( laughs ) ( laughter ) sorry , i just feel such a , i feel such a cassandra here . ( laughter )
on the one hand , we can choose between a new golden age where information is more universally available than it &apos;s ever been in human history , where we all have the answers to our questions at our fingertips .
after a kind of long , awkward period of time , steve broke the silence .
don &apos;t black-box history . don &apos;t check your principles at the door .
( applause ) danit peleg : thank you , rebecca .
yet each pales to insignificance with the completion of that magnificent accomplishment of twenty-first-century technology , the digital superhighway .
i convinced my 10th grade english teacher to allow me to do my book report on stephen king &apos;s &quot; &quot; misery &quot; &quot; as an animated short . ( laughter ) and i kept making comics .
that word , &quot; &quot; good , &quot; &quot; and the number 6.8 and the discovery that &apos;s behind it have changed my life .
the thing is , they see their lives and the risks they run decidedly differently .
( laughter ) here &apos;s me , just so we &apos;re even .
we have to take matters into our own hands , not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone — and that &apos;s the hard part — but by improving our own .
i &apos;ve made clear again and again and again that i go to sleep every morning thinking about what i can do for the american people .
little by little it gets colder until eventually it approaches absolute zero .
peers are giving and doing things that are incredibly expensive for companies to do .
when i was a graduate student , it was one of the most exciting times to be working in nanotechnology .
they run some more of the numbers , and at the end of about three or four weeks , turns out they have mapped the exact trajectory of this satellite around the earth , just from listening to this one little signal , going off on this little side hunch that they &apos;d been inspired to do over lunch one morning .
and what went wrong ?
this is sometimes called &quot; &quot; the mama bear effect . &quot; &quot; like a mama bear defending her cubs , when we advocate for others , we can discover our own voice .
and you &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ve got to take this . &quot; &quot; the really beautiful thing is , you know how when somebody &apos;s sitting next to you , sometimes they can sort of hear a little bit of the caller .
so we talked to some sources in hama who we had been back and forth with on twitter , and we asked them about this , and the bridge was interesting to us because it was something we could identify .
those are the ideas where there is no argument in a society , but you are not able to implement those things .
i do not want to have my conclusions tested . &quot; &quot; it feels so much more comfortable simply to lay down the law .
in this respect , the data has gone from a stock to a flow , from something that is stationary and static to something that is fluid and dynamic .
intimacy for us means a lot of different things .
&quot; &quot; if we accept the theory of evolution , then the first dawn of synthesis of life must consist in the production of forms intermediate between the inorganic and the organic world , or between the non-living and living world , forms which possess only some of the rudimentary attributes of life &quot; &quot; — so , the ones i just discussed — &quot; &quot; to which other attributes will be slowly added in the course of development by the evolutionary actions of the environment . &quot; &quot; so we start simple , we make some structures that may have some of these characteristics of life , and then we try to develop that to become more lifelike .
that was his idea of a performance-enhancing drug .
the worship of those we hate .
so i &apos;m like , whoa .
because once john committed himself to putting his life back together — first physically , then emotionally , and then spiritually — he found that there were very few resources available to someone who has attempted to end their life in the way that he did .
second of all , i &apos;ll bet even you people who are untrained can see the difference , and we see here an st segment elevation right after this sharp line .
child : i think he is going to take that one .
tg : i believe that beauty is a basic service .
the bonobo , although shorter than us and their arms still longer , is more upright , just as we are .
i got into it because i wanted to help people feel better .
you don &apos;t need this for what you can get in wal-mart ; you need this for what makes you unique .
i was just so tired .
we dug and dug and dug , and there wasn &apos;t another bone around .
researchers at emory gave children a simple &quot; &quot; what do you know &quot; &quot; test .
hollywood gathers around power tables , and the valley gathers around power tables .
this is actually just a picture of the earth at night , and i &apos;m just putting it up because i think it &apos;s pretty .
and what we &apos;re looking for is the tiny dimming of light that is caused by a planet passing in front of one of these stars and blocking some of that starlight from getting to us .
we are but two threads cut from the same cloth .
and we ought to give it to them .
in particular , it tells us why we see immorality .
it &apos;s 40,000 dollars to build the university of pittsburgh medical school .
so how are they going to divide up breadwinning and caregiving responsibilities ?
who just turned out the lights ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) &quot; what &apos;s that over there ? &quot; &quot; what ? &quot;
it would be a personalized chip just for you .
we can &apos;t overestimate the amount of despair that we are generating with places like this .
( laughter ) and we stop listening .
suddenly , we &apos;re back in that trishaw again and we &apos;re bumping off the broad , well-lit streets ; and we &apos;re reminded , really , of the first law of travel and , therefore , of life : you &apos;re only as strong as your readiness to surrender .
i think there is outer truth and there &apos;s inner truth .
and the second thing it does , and it gives us a very clear direction of travel for new therapies — i mean , you don &apos;t need to be a rocket scientist to know what to do here .
it &apos;s not true .
it &apos;s very much like the rutting of mammals , including humans , you know , sorting out our differences , but gentler , no biting allowed .
it &apos;s a scraper bike ; it &apos;s called — from oakland .
no , well , i guess when i was a girl , we didn &apos;t really have a name for that either .
it took us about 10 minutes to climb up to the top of that dune , which goes to show why they had to move to a safer location .
so i started taking a look at them . ( music ) i saw one of them that featured a kitten and her mom and wishing her mom a happy mother &apos;s day .
and information will tell her when to go to market with which product .
i &apos;m suffering from gallery fatigue .
( applause ) thank you so much .
journalists , this is off the record ; it &apos;s embargoed .
they warned us earlier that every imaginable mishap has occurred to speakers up here on the stage .
here , this animation is zooming in onto our solar system .
i have friends who are very confident they can do certain things , but i realize that they overestimate their own competence .
but when you want to do something new , you have to apply the physics approach .
why does everyone get rid of me ?
i know when i had a job that required two bus rides and a subway ride every morning , i used to go to the library on weekends to get stuff to read .
you say , &quot; &quot; well , of course i can &apos;t write today , because i &apos;m giving a tedtalk and i have five media interviews , and then i &apos;m going to a cocktail party and then i &apos;ll be drunk after that .
there is more energy flowing through , per gram per second , than anything that we have any other experience with .
now , you can see how this could be a problem , especially because the government considers so much of what it does secret .
but usually that is linked to very strong social disparities .
we still think it is pristine .
any child can say , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m a tiger , &quot; &quot; pretend to be a tiger .
well , this is a lot of water , and again , we &apos;re mining water and using it to grow food , and today , if you travel down further down the colorado , it dries up completely and no longer flows into the ocean .
at the end of that time , i went off to australia , about 20 years ago .
as he was nearing his death , his disciples and followers kept asking him , &quot; &quot; what &apos;s the secret ?
we can start with mongolia , or as some call it , mine-golia .
so , let me just tell you how that goes .
sandy &apos;s story was about the return to the bronx of supreme court justice sonia sotomayor .
and it has not been the case for most of modern american history .
what if travel were like a magnificent buffet of local experiences ?
we don &apos;t know you &apos;re there , so it &apos;s kind of nice to say &quot; &quot; hello &quot; &quot; first .
we have superstar bankers .
( laughter ) and some of you guys are entrepreneurs , etc . , whatever .
this is what it looks like .
and a year after that , we did conquer it .
and so , i want to give you a greeting , as from a chimpanzee in the forests of tanzania — ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh !
and if you manipulate the speed of this rotor , you are actually able to crack the rotor and eventually even have the centrifuge explode .
and from alabama to alaska , a group of women who had always wanted to do something that mattered alongside the best of the best , and to make a difference for their country , answered that call to serve .
( video ) luke massella : i was really sick . i could barely get out of bed .
just when we know we need to be learning to live on the surface of our planet , off the power of sun , wind and waves , we are frantically digging to get at the dirtiest , highest-emitting stuff imaginable .
the other reason is this amazing bush glows .
now , as you gain elevation your iq goes down — ( laughter ) but your emotional affect goes up , which is great for having a mythic experience , whether you want to or not .
ag : we are getting more support .
so the effect that this stroke could have on mario &apos;s body could be the fact that he couldn &apos;t be able to control the left side of his body .
i left san francisco , where i live , on monday , and i was getting on the plane for this conference .
you can burst bubbles .
now , when we think about changing human nature , the first thing that comes to mind are these human modification technologies — growth hormone therapy , cosmetic surgery , stimulants like ritalin , adderall , anti-depressants , anabolic steroids , artificial hearts .
but of course , that only works when we have both of these components .
i &apos;m sure that in this room there are , like , 15 other wonderful stories of nonprofits doing spectacular work .
the modern healthcare sector has totally collapsed .
instead of crying or ceasing our play , instead of waking my parents , with all the negative consequences for me , a smile spread across her face and she scrambled back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn — ( laughter ) with one broken leg .
it &apos;s kind of an extraordinary story when you realize that this is twice as common as homicide and actually more common as a source of death than traffic fatalities in this country .
and i started thinking about a counseling program .
and what &apos;s really , really great about being here is i &apos;m sure that the questions that you guys have are very , very different than the questions that i think up myself .
step back , give your mother a break , okay .
cetaceans and primates have also an autobiographical self to a certain degree .
we &apos;re not born craving whoppers or skittles .
there &apos;s increased hunting and fishing for commercial purposes .
we said that if you stop to swap your battery more than 50 times a year we start paying you money because it &apos;s an inconvenience .
so what you can see now is that the ferrofluid has formed spikes .
&quot; &quot; oh , it &apos;s very easy . it &apos;s the western world and it &apos;s the developing world , &quot; &quot; they say .
and how futile seemed the words of advice to me from great british veteran conductor sir colin davis who said , &quot; &quot; conducting , charles , is like holding a small bird in your hand .
it &apos;s not in their taste , really . it &apos;s not in their texture .
why not apply that to our looking at paintings ?
( laughter ) he had no idea what that was , ( laughter ) so i spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans , and i walked out of the store — truth ! — with the best-fitting jeans i had ever had .
what does the inside of your computer actually look like ?
and artists who were formerly constrained can now do things that were never , ever possible for them before .
because of the overhanging leaves and branches , you &apos;ll notice that the understory is very dark , it &apos;s very still .
so you have to find rocks of the right age , depending on what your interests are .
can you place that down into the floor ?
let me start by asking you a question , just with a show of hands : who has an iphone ?
i was about 10 years old on a camping trip with my dad in the adirondack mountains , a wilderness area in the northern part of new york state .
it &apos;s twice the range of any electric motorcycle .
is it the exposure ? we have professors from mit , berkeley , stanford , indian institute of science who come and teach our children lots of scientific formulas , experiments , much beyond the classroom .
narrator : on january 24th , apple computer will introduce macintosh .
i &apos;d spoken to all the experts .
that &apos;s another argument for why we need to step into the lab and really measure the impact of technology on the brain .
as it turns out , these two abilities are also essential for all of us to function well in our society .
and just as one example of the kind of thing you can do , you can take a complex network , use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense network .
and i went there a few months ago — photos are still there — and it was missing a piece of the eye .
and of course , there &apos;s nothing special about cromwell or bladders — you have just breathed in a nitrogen atom that passed through the right lung of the third iguanodon to the left of the tall cycad tree .
both poets , writers , creatives with a long history of community work behind us , and big , huge dreams of a family in front of us , we shared a lot of things in common , but we were also incredibly different .
early visions of wireless power actually were thought of by nikola tesla basically about 100 years ago .
so where do we go from here ?
and when we go to cop15 at the end of this year we can &apos;t stop thinking of padding co2 .
one of the most impressive things about what some , perhaps 10 , of the speakers have been talking about is the realization , as you listen to them carefully , that they &apos;re not saying : well , this is what we should do ; this is what i would like you to do .
i think that &apos;s rather creepy , actually . why would a neighborhood have a logo ?
all of these new technologies just offer tremendous opportunities for us to be able to impact the individuals with autism , but yet we have a long way to go .
so now i ask you , how do i feel when the time finally comes and there &apos;s another dark night , sometime between midnight and 2 a.m. ?
the most surprising thing that i &apos;ve learned while running this contest is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research .
not quite the whole truth . anyway .
and so , the place that we took it to was this place called a brine pool , which is in the northern part of the gulf of mexico .
but unfortunately he gets sick . he gets really sick at the end of the story .
egyptians on social media were wondering , &quot; if tunisia did it , why can &apos;t we ? &quot;
so why all the big deal about genetics ?
let &apos;s start with the global challenge of urbanization .
when she gives birth to the first girl child , first daughter , she is sad .
physicists have told us for a long time that the metal of that train looks solid but really it &apos;s mostly empty space with microscopic particles zipping around .
but i &apos;d also like to point out that the oceans are much more connected than we think .
that &apos;s why they don &apos;t know whether their mutual fund manager is taking 0.1 percent or 0.15 percent of their investment , but they clip coupons to save one dollar off of toothpaste .
and at that point , the universe mysteriously starts accelerating its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger-scale structure .
so this is jonathan . he &apos;s 37 years old . he has a master &apos;s degree .
so here , in wool , through a domestic feminine art , is the proof that the most famous postulate in mathematics is wrong .
we &apos;re now 6.8 billion people , and we &apos;re expected to be 9 billion people by 2050 .
i &apos;d just like to point out , if you look at the map of africa , it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape .
the fear is the child .
now , unfortunately , i don &apos;t have a solution to this problem , apart from recommending that more of us think about it .
ev : dark chocolate with almonds .
we all live in this fast-paced , digital world , but we still crave and desire something that &apos;s relatable .
when you look at the incredible work that my colleagues are doing all around the world and what they &apos;re finding , i believe that there are millions of undiscovered archaeological sites left to find .

i was working on the cranial collections , and it just struck me as ironic that here were people coming to see this gory , primitive , savage culture that they were almost fantasizing about and creating without really understanding what they were seeing , and all the while these vast — i mean hundreds of thousands of skulls in our museums , all across europe and the states — were kind of upholding this enlightenment pursuit of scientific rationality .
obviously the church weren &apos;t very happy about this , and they tried to suppress it , but what they hadn &apos;t counted on was technology , and then they had the printing press , which suddenly enabled these ideas to spread cheaply , far and fast , and people would come together in coffee houses , discuss the ideas , plot revolution .

you don &apos;t need the 30-day waiting period .
and there was one more big soulful lesson , and that one i learned from albert einstein .
we were asked to undertake a study and investigate the potential of a site out in stratford in the olympic park .
and in that disconnected state , yeah , we can build factory farms with no windows , destroy marine life and use rape as a weapon of war .
darwin worried about the relationship between what he said and the truths of religion , but he could proceed , he could write books about his subject without having to say what the relationship was to the religious claims , and similarly , geologists increasingly could talk about it .
and if you take a look at the headline of stage five , which is &quot; &quot; life is great , &quot; &quot; this may seem a little incongruous .
in fact there are people in this room who may not want me to show you this clip we &apos;re about to see .
( applause ) the parking meter , invented in oklahoma city .
what if instead we just got really curious about what was happening in our momentary experience ?
jim cameron actually photographed the real titanic .
glucose is very important , and we know it &apos;s involved with diabetes .
in the past , i talked about it .
forty of the 50 most dangerous cities in the world are right here in latin america , 13 in brazil , and the most dangerous of all , it &apos;s san pedro sula , honduras &apos; second city , with a staggering homicide rate of 187 murders per 100,000 people .
and the result of that is , we &apos;re going to generate 83,000 new jobs , four billion dollars a year in annual income , and reduce the co2 emissions by 174 million tons a year .
so now we have a whole extended bacteria family , filled with virus sleeper cells .
as a quarter of the world population is influenced by it , you &apos;d be wise to do something about that .
so we documented this invention step by step on a website for inventors called instructables , in the hope that somebody would make it even better .
and this is so powerful that when they tweak their stats , when they say your crops wilt after eight hours , or after six hours , or after 24 hours , it changes the life cycle of some 70 million people during the day .
mark lynch , he &apos;s an amazing teacher and he &apos;s still a dear friend of mine , and i was 14 or 15 , and i walked into his comic book class halfway through the course , and i was so excited , i was beaming .
thank you .
so when the children see this , they say , &quot; &quot; ah ! acceleration , &quot; &quot; remembering back four months when they did their cars sideways , and they start measuring to find out what kind of acceleration it is .
so we started out trying to figure out . how do we get to 10 cents ?
they are less likely to see a therapist , less likely to be diagnosed with depression , less likely to be taking prescription medication .
it &apos;s not permanently in the exclusive economic zones of these five central american countries , but it moves with the season .
&quot; until you can get home ? &quot;
we &apos;re not just talking about a few pages of ones and zeros .
now is the time to create change in this industry and to push it into a sustainable direction .
the first component of the story that i thought was essential , however , was to give readers a sense of appreciation for the ocean animals that they were eating .
it was three steps .
so that plan was going really well , except the coding part , and then one morning a few months ago , i woke up to the news that the wife of a certain presidential candidate had given a speech that — ( laughter ) ( applause ) that sounded eerily like a speech given by one of my other faves , michelle obama .
bina rothblatt : it &apos;s been really an exciting journey , and i would have never thought that at the time , but we started making goals and setting those goals and accomplishing things , and before you knew it , we just keep going up and up and we &apos;re still not stopping , so it &apos;s great .
and most importantly , if the staircase is real , it explains the persistent undercurrent of dissatisfaction in modern life .
( video ) pilot : release our fire .
we can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death , seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
who was here or has otherwise seen hans rosling &apos;s talk ?
kyoto protocol system .
so what is open hardware ?
number one : we have to start with digital media literacy , and clearly it must have a gendered lens .
we think about a little boy trying to get to sleep .
this is a beautiful quote that i found — we &apos;re talking about serendipity there — from alexander fleming : &quot; &quot; when i woke up just after dawn on september 28 , 1928 , i certainly didn &apos;t plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world &apos;s first antibiotic . &quot; &quot; now , the explorers of the world of the atom did not intend to invent the transistor .
what if you could make them fun , attractive , clean , environmentally friendly ?
the ecliptic , which is the path of the sun , moon , and planets correspond to an offset circle .
i can tell you that the data on the number of children per woman is surprisingly good in all countries .
believing in each other , really being sure when push comes to shove that each one of us can do amazing things in the world , that is what can make our stories into love stories and our collective story into one that continually perpetuates hope and good things for all of us .
i think the headline in the new york times was , &quot; &quot; are you packing it on ?
let universality make way for plurality .
they range from 450 million years ago to the last , the k-t , number four , but the biggest of all was the p , or the permian extinction , sometimes called the mother of all mass extinctions .
it looks like a little of string pearls basically — in fact , three strings of pearls .
and the brain specializes for it .
when i travel through megacities from end to end — it takes hours and days — i experience the tragedy of extreme disparity within the same geography .
see those hands there ? these are not built for farming .
players are shown pairs of urban scenes , and they &apos;re asked to choose which one is more beautiful , quiet and happy .
and katy perry drinks her morning coffee out of an amber owl .
well , i eventually got to the rhode island school of design .
&apos;we &apos;ve got to case the joint .
and many , many things at google have come out of that , such as orkut and also google news .
as wealth goes up in a society , the suicide rate goes up instead of down .
the fact is no government in the world , with the exception of a few , like that of idi amin , can seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule .
( laughter ) so i &apos;m listening to all this , you know , and i &apos;m like , is this guy for real ? is he making some of this up ?
it &apos;s something like this : and i had blocks in the pyramid , and the cornerstones being industriousness and enthusiasm , working hard and enjoying what you &apos;re doing , coming up to the apex , according to my definition of success .
and so the question is , &quot; &quot; why is this happening ? &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not being imposed by fiat from above .
and in fact , when you &apos;re turning around , and you &apos;re looking inside the house , and you &apos;re looking for this stuff , this is where you look first , right ?
what does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time ?
they have a broad trans-ideological appeal , and because we want them actually to happen , we figured out ways to do them that do not require much , if any , federal legislation , and can , indeed , be done administratively or at a state level .
we have great examples of that , unfortunately .
wwb : wind , water , birds — stochastic natural sounds composed of lots of individual random events , all of it very healthy , all of it sound that we evolved to over the years .
they watched their children change and they had no idea how to help them .
thank you for that reaction .
whatever it is you are struggling to remember , it is not poised on the tip of your tongue , not even lurking in some obscure corner of your spleen .
and we &apos;re now in a very strange sort of twilight zone , where no one quite knows what &apos;s worked , or what doesn &apos;t .
( laughter ) what is a woman without a clitoris supposed to do with her life ?
the life cycle impact of that lettuce is astronomical .
bring it back up .
yet authorities in countries like the united states , the united kingdom and many other democracies are seeking to use the law to either weaken or outright ban strong encryption , because the bad guys are using it , too .
and not only that , that mycelium connects different individuals in the forest , individuals not only of the same species but between species , like birch and fir , and it works kind of like the internet .
so i wanted to create a new kind of medicine , in order to create a new kind of relationship between the patient and the treatment .
that &apos;s how it works .
and two days later i came to do my next emergency shift , and that &apos;s when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office .
the way i like to put this is : one idea . ideas are meant to be shared , so one idea can serve one world , one market .
so go ahead , ask yourself , what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail ?
one day in rehab someone , started talking about surfing and all these guys who &apos;d never surfed before said , &quot; &quot; hey , let &apos;s go . &quot; &quot; and they went surfing .
the struggle between for and against is the mind &apos;s worst disease . &quot; &quot; now unfortunately , it &apos;s a disease that has been caught by many of the world &apos;s leaders .
in order to sustain our work into the future , we use technology centers where we partner with local universities and colleges to take the technology to them , whereby they then can help us with digital preservation of their heritage sites , and at the same time , it gives them the technology to benefit from in the future .
but this has come as a great boon for them .
( audio ) natalia rybczynski : yeah , i had someone call me &quot; &quot; dr. dead things . &quot; &quot; latif nasser : and i think she &apos;s particularly interesting because of where she digs that stuff up , way above the arctic circle in the remote canadian tundra .
a child &apos;s playstation today is more powerful than a military supercomputer from 1996 .
and they said , &quot; &quot; jeez , you know , we think we could actually take a look at the slope of the doppler effect to figure out the points at which the satellite is closest to our antennae and the points at which it &apos;s farthest away .
again , we just take these lines and recursively replace them with the whole shape .
then , on december 26th last year , just two months ago , that underwater earthquake triggered the tsunami .
i use the garden , the soil , like it &apos;s a piece of cloth , and the plants and the trees , that &apos;s my embellishment for that cloth .
i might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday — that seemed pretty darn unlikely .
whereas before the farmer used to think local — meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market , eight to 10 kilometers away on average , and sell whatever they happened to have , without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was — now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market .
so each building has its own personality .
when muhammad told me his personal story , how his father , 55 years old , collapsed at home , had a cardiac arrest , and it took over an hour for an ambulance arrive , and he saw his father die in front of his eyes , he asked me , &quot; &quot; please start this in east jerusalem . &quot; &quot; i said to myself , i saw so much tragedy , so much hate , and it &apos;s not about saving jews . it &apos;s not about saving muslims .
but yet they &apos;re experiencing something so unbelievably pure , which is before the sound is actually happening .
camp two , another 2,000 feet higher up , what &apos;s called the western cwm .
some of them are not states anymore at all .
and this referendum would propose having those dollars go to law enforcement and safety .
i learned a lesson from it .
and this might be associated with some of the differences in health associated with cesarean birth , such as more asthma , more allergies , even more obesity , all of which have been linked to microbes now , and when you think about it , until recently , every surviving mammal had been delivered by the birth canal , and so the lack of those protective microbes that we &apos;ve co-evolved with might be really important for a lot of these different conditions that we now know involve the microbiome .
but not those babies — not yet .
and , of course , the heartbreaking , flip side of this study , is that they took the &quot; &quot; a students &quot; &quot; and told them they were &quot; &quot; d &apos;s . &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what happened at the end of that three-month period .
it &apos;s a spinning globe , the surface of which is entirely composed of the pictures and words and drawings of people that submitted to the time capsule .
i have started teaching part-time , and with my husband , who juggles several jobs , we &apos;ve opened a small bookshop .
they &apos;re not affronted by differences , they &apos;re fascinated by them , and that is a huge shift in mindset , and once you feel it , you want it to happen a lot more .
some of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores , a greater comfort level with the material , especially with the boys , that in going outside and playing , they aren &apos;t afraid to take on a double-digit multiplication problem — and also that the teachers are able to use these as assessment tools to better gauge how their students are understanding new material .
and what &apos;s worse , what they &apos;re learning there isn &apos;t even practically useful anymore .
so , back to mars .
those who embrace their roles and work to improve their performance grow , change and expand the self .
does the novel show us a way out ? i &apos;m not sure .
as a matter of fact , we think reaching 100 percent is very doable , even before the 2015 timeframe . in other parts of emerging countries , such as india and china , the progress has been good — has been solid , has been good . but in places that are not as developed , places like africa , latin america and other places in the world , the progress has been rather slow . as a matter of fact , i was just recently visiting south africa .
and again , i posted a conductor video , and we started accepting submissions .
they stand for numbers for a particular book .
is it different women who are doing the preserving and the radicalizing ?
( laughter ) behind the humor is the idea of making the cubicle more human . ) david kelley : so here &apos;s the final thing , complete with orange lighting that follows the sun across — that follows the tracks of the sun — across the sky .
( laughter ) so my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone — all races , all religions , all income and education levels .
and we have not had the other side of the argument fully aired so that people can draw their own conclusions .
but perhaps most heartbreaking of all are the stories of the abuse of even the most basic human rights , such as the young woman shown in this image here that are played out every day , sadly , even in the very institutions that were built to care for people with mental illnesses , the mental hospitals .
thank you .
it turns out , atrazine is the largest selling product for the largest chemical company in the world .
it is accepted that for such an aim , knowledge creation , interaction among people , face-to-face contact , it &apos;s important , and we agreed on that .
so a fundamental shift , and now you have environmentalists and economists like ed glaeser saying we are a destructive species .
well , it turns out that those cells used in that laboratory , they &apos;re male cells , and the animals used in the animal studies were male animals , and the clinical trials have been performed almost exclusively on men .
eight years later , when they discovered there was a plot to kill him , they dressed him up like a beggar and snuck him out of the country on horseback , and took the same trip that tamdin did .
first , because as i &apos;ve discussed on this stage before , i learned that the fbi has been monitoring my work .
does that mean that you think that the other things we think our brains are about — the dreaming , the yearning , the falling in love and all these things — are a kind of side show , an accident ?
chris anderson : i just have a couple of questions for you .
these are all complexity questions , and computer science tells us that these are very hard questions .
let &apos;s see what sweden has done .
and you say , &quot; &quot; if you were me , doc , what would you do ? &quot; &quot; and the doc says , &quot; &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot; &quot; and the result is — we call it &quot; &quot; patient autonomy , &quot; &quot; which makes it sound like a good thing , but it really is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision-making from somebody who knows something — namely , the doctor — to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions — namely , the patient .
it looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation .
follow the calculus tag on tumblr , and yes , you will see people complaining about calculus , but you &apos;ll also see people re-blogging those complaints , making the argument that calculus is interesting and beautiful , and here &apos;s a way in to thinking about the problem that you find unsolvable .
it &apos;s getting them wrong that is living .
these were the fears that danced in the imaginations of these poor men , and as it turned out , the fear they chose to listen to would govern whether they lived or died .
and roots and shoots is a program for hope .
and it has , but you also notice , right over there , that it has a very abstract image that it has still managed to recognize and cluster as horses .
we clearly can .
we &apos;ve got to get our hero , captain willard , to the mouth of the nung river so he can go pursue colonel kurtz .
well , they didn &apos;t . they didn &apos;t want to send their books .
so we developed a different approach .
well , surprisingly enough , amazingly enough , the anatomists had a very poor idea of the structure of the lung until very recently .
that implication was studied by boltzmann back in the 19th century .
to claim that he &apos;s &quot; &quot; not really nigerian , &quot; &quot; though , denies his experience in lagos , the rituals he practiced growing up , his relationship with family and friends .
this is peak fishing in a few seconds . the &apos; 60s .
night had fallen , and i went out under this great overturned saltshaker of stars , and i could see the tail lights of cars disappearing around the headlands 12 miles to the south .
last lesson , from a latin american : this is the great poet jorge luis borges .
i loved that i could hide within this shadow my own painted version , and it would be almost invisible until the light changed , and all of a sudden my shadow would be brought to the light .
doesn &apos;t mean that people who are in between don &apos;t experience racism , but it means that the closer you are to white on that spectrum , the better off you are .
well , most of you anyway .
okay , a few of you .
below the surface there is hard saline water .
and i decided that , in fact , i didn &apos;t really want to create complicated stuff .
so all of this money started pouring in , and all of this fame started pouring in .
and to help you , i &apos;ve got two things to leave you with , from two great philosophers , perhaps two of the greatest philosopher thinkers of the 20th century , one a mathematician and an engineer , and the other a poet .
and people in white hats sailing boats .
and so if you change the recipe , and you add things when you pour — so you add things to your liquid silk solution — where these things are enzymes or antibodies or vaccines , the self-assembly process preserves the biological function of these dopants .
i was a child , too young to understand the circumstances of my being there .
we gotta do something different . we gotta think radical .
( laughter ) . so they &apos;ve got a little bit of a sibling rivalry thing going on here .
it &apos;s in the developmental power of entrepreneurship , the ethical power of democracy .
and said , &quot; &quot; hi , i &apos;m trying to make a toaster .
i looked but didn &apos;t see .
( applause ) bruno giussani : thomas piketty . thank you .
i would love to see google maps inside some of these caves .
we redid the side of the building and re-proportioned the windows so it sort of fit into the space .
and so reading and educating your emotions is one of the central activities of wisdom .
so what &apos;s actually happening is that social networks and real-time technologies are taking us back .
the women in this room and watching in l.a.
i thought , the love you have for your children is unlike any other feeling in the world , and until you have children , you don &apos;t know what it feels like .
at the same time , for me and for many other people , that view is a bit too close to simply denying the datum of consciousness to be satisfactory .
so , her caretakers took her to the village medicine man , and instead of suggesting to the caretakers that the girl be taken to a hospital , the person decided to burn her abdomen with red-hot iron bars to drive out the demons .
and unfortunately or fortunately , chemistry won .
fortunately , the big tech companies seem to agree .
and the idea is that the character has an inner motor , a dominant , unconscious goal that they &apos;re striving for , an itch that they can &apos;t scratch .
hey , hey black-eyed susie , hey .
it &apos;s a nonprofit , venture capital fund for the poor , a few oxymorons in one sentence .
so my team has taken five days-worth of growth , a typical growth cycle for us , and condensed it into a 15-second time lapse .
they were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves .
and my theme was this : our earth has existed for 45 million centuries , but this one is special — it &apos;s the first where one species , ours , has the planet &apos;s future in its hands .
so does all this matter ? or is globaloney just a harmless way of getting people to pay more attention to globalization-related issues ?
he &apos;s had that arm for about 20 months , so he &apos;s pretty good with it .
and you might say , &quot; &quot; can you really be that specific ?
and on the surface , cassini has found liquid .
what &apos;s it gonna look like ? we have huge grand challenges these days of habitat loss . we have more and more people , billions of people , in 100 years , god knows how many people , and how little space there will be to fit all of them , so we need to change the way that we see cities , and looking at this picture on the left of new york city today , you can see how gray and brown it is .
imagine a coil . for those of you that are engineers , there &apos;s a capacitor attached to it too .
i &apos;m pleased to say that there is now also a website looking at effective animal organizations .
what we saw is a lot of people — actually , at the beginning , we saw a lot more people opening the app because they were curious what they would find when they opened it .
several of these nutrients are essential chemical elements : phosphorus , nitrogen and calcium .
and i understand that .
let me show you what you could do right now .
this is great smoky mountains national park , and the hemlocks are dead as far as the eye can see .
so we prowl from house to house looking for flies captured in spider webs and we set them free .
so we go out for about five months every summer in a 20-meter catamaran , and we live , sleep and work at sea for weeks at a time .
and so this woman , mrs. young-soon han , i suppose will have taught me the most that i have learned about race .
for those of you who &apos;ve been there , fantastic coral reefs , fantastic diving , fantastic snorkeling .
and this is all over mathematics and this is all over computer science , and there &apos;s a really deep connection between empathy and these sciences .
and in the spring , when the sun returns to the ice , it forms the phytoplankton , grows under that ice , and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed , and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life .
and we quickly realized that our coming together was more than just a union of two people , but was a model of possibility for the millions of lgbtq folks who have been sold this lie that family and matrimony is antithetical to who they are — for those of us who rarely get to see ourselves reflected in love and happiness .
so i decided , i &apos;m going to make this a real biennial .
( applause ) and that number is really powerful , because last year we only graduated 7,500 women in computer science .
so given the prince loved his music , haydn thought he &apos;d write a symphony to make the point .
( applause ) so i just want to say a couple more things about that particular story , and then try to generalize how could we have stories of success all over the place for these diseases , as sam says , these 4,000 that are waiting for answers .
so what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an asian person and a european person by looking at their ingredients list .
basically , i was brought up to be a good samaritan , and i am .
since i joined twitter in 2011 , misogyny and misogynists have amply demonstrated they will dog my every step .
we &apos;re on the verge of a whole new social science .
what is a chubby , curly-haired guy from holland — why is he whistling ?
he sees something in the path .
she did things she always wanted to do .
i &apos;ve brought with me , from southern california , the fm device .
this is a very , very low level in order to be kicked out of the health care system .
and in a plastic-wrapped and packaged world , he doesn &apos;t hold out much hope for that , either .
and providing data free of charge on the internet , for the world to use . thank you very much .
rsw : no . what did he say ?
( laughter ) so , it was in the course of these investigations that i ran into a map .
this is happening today .
i mean , it was so incredibly close .
they were basically a city living with a modern kind of industrial metropolis with an elizabethan public infrastructure .
i went there looking for truth .
it takes 20 years to produce somebody with a ph.d.
my bosses , in the beginning , were very surprised .
well , then you look to europe , and the most important alliance in the world has been the transatlantic relationship .
and some of this , again , is in the realm of political work .
on a typical day , do you wake up with hope or gloom ?
and after we failed , i just kept failing .
it had to be shipped to london .
ca : okay . so , thank you , mark .
so our team released a very easy , simple-to-use tool in plain language to help people prepare , to help ease their nerves , to help them feel more confident in taking the next step in pursuing their american dream .
and the problem is , that turns you into a shrewd animal who treats life as a game , and you become a cold , calculating creature who slips into a sort of mediocrity where you realize there &apos;s a difference between your desired self and your actual self .
and we didn &apos;t find a single record of any preference about goals , treatments or outcomes from any of the sets of notes initiated by a doctor or by a patient .
so for instance , we are asking ourselves , how can we create more light ?
and the exciting thing is it &apos;s starting to grow .
( applause ) chris anderson : stop . i &apos;ve got two questions .
but we only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged brain compared to the brain of an alzheimer &apos;s patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease .
it &apos;s just the female .
i became so hysterical over her treatment , that eventually , she was just beaten behind closed doors .
we have a long history of strong , courageous , independent women , ever since the viking age .
there &apos;s not a lot of clickiness .
i achieved access to the data , and today i &apos;m able to do physics at the level of the best astronomer , using sound .
his friends and former students became his doctors .
i hope that you will be able to see not just my taliban-like beard , but also the richness and color of my perceptions , aspirations and dreams , as rich and colorful as the satchels that i sell .
i &apos;ll tell you very quickly how the effect works .
for almost a century , we didn &apos;t know much about these .
am i going to be asexual ? &quot; &quot; because from what i knew about fgm , the whole aim of it was to control the sexuality of women .
to be clear , i &apos;m not suggesting that we do away with countries .
and suddenly the most amazing things started coming out of our daughters &apos; mouths .
we &apos;re now on the couch , looking out through the window at cars passing by .
people low on it like things that are familiar , that are safe and dependable .
they are 75 percent of the energy consumption — up to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
as i said , all the balconies can move , but they can also be disappeared completely .
consider that blue icon for a ted talk that you &apos;re writing .
they &apos;ve probably got these environmental risk factors and / or genetic risk factors we don &apos;t know about .
there &apos;s no waste .
and even being here — i mean , the last few days , i &apos;ve known heights of obsessive behavior i never thought about .
( breathes in ) ( breathes out ) so , i didn &apos;t always make my living from music .
but i think today that most would agree that greece was only a symptom of much deeper structural problems in the eurozone , vulnerabilities in the wider global economic system , vulnerabilities of our democracies .
they will say the worst things about you .
and , sadly , we don &apos;t know .
( laughter ) so why do we think that our choice of a four dollar shade-grown fair trade artisanal cup of coffee in a reusable mug matters , but what we do with 4,000 dollars in our investment account for our ira doesn &apos;t ?
and humor is a good way , i think , to address serious issues .
when the soul lies down in that grass , the world is too full to talk about .
they have the people and the government with this exclusive dependency , but the problem here is that congress has evolved a different dependence , no longer a dependence upon the people alone , increasingly a dependence upon the funders .
and after i left mattel , i started all these hamburger makers , and then got the license to make the maker .
this is one of the best-known phenomena in the quantum world , quantum tunneling .
that was fall of &apos; 95 . but then , by the time that winter was rolling around , he said , &quot; &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
many people said that night that it was the first time that they had a meaningful religious experience in their entire lives .
it gives us some information vegetables ; it gives us some information dessert .
we often dwell on human trafficking survivors &apos; victimization .
these were literally wild-posted all over new york one night , and there were definitely some heads turning , you know , people smoking and , &quot; &quot; huh ! &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and it was purposely done to look fairly serious .
conservation issues are normally guided towards rare , endemic plants , but what we call exotic plants , that is , the ones which grow in many different habitats across the world , they also need to be considered .
the second thing we believe is we believe in going with the grain of human nature .
when the industrial revolution started , the amount of carbon sitting underneath britain in the form of coal was as big as the amount of carbon sitting under saudi arabia in the form of oil .
it tries to balance out , and that &apos;s just .
and that would remind you that you would want to then introduce your friend ed cook .
3.8 billion years of field-testing .
there &apos;s something in new york city .
and it goes with a book that says , &quot; &quot; read my pins . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) pm : so is this a good idea .
that area of design interests me the most , and i think this for me is a real clear , very simplified version of what i &apos;m talking about .
as whole human beings , we will be better caregivers and breadwinners .
as one cmu prisoner said , &quot; we &apos;re not being tortured here , except psychologically . &quot;
so if you measure the precursor signal , you can actually identify pre- and post-maturity problems in advance .
and you know , and the troubling thing is that it &apos;s much easier to do something bad than to defend against all possible bad things , so the offensive uses really have an asymmetric advantage .
but this is not an ancient conflict .
ca : c &apos;mon , c &apos;mon . martial arts , games . c &apos;mon .
when you are told that carrots have human rights because they share half our genes — but not how gene percentages confer rights — wizard .
even the cowboys are pit crews now .
and meanwhile , at acting school ...
remember when images were first possible with a computer , those gorgeous , full-color images ?
now , what &apos;s important about what these people are doing is that they &apos;re beginning to learn how to communicate with species that are not us but share a common sensory environment .
it says , &quot; &quot; i will be a little late for school tomorrow . &quot; &quot; he was supposed to be in the school at 8 a.m.
so the idea that we can actually involve people in doing this thing together , collectively .
we &apos;ve got to wake up to the fact that we don &apos;t have any more and that this is a finite planet .
it &apos;s not special to us .
can we harness these same technologies for an emotionally sensitive output ?
( laughter ) and again , we think that &apos;s perfectly normal and natural , but that has not been the case for most of human history .
i must say there is magic in these moments .
my wife &apos;s loveliness almost consumes me .
if you drove past solly somewhere out on the reserve , you look up in your rearview mirror , you &apos;d see he &apos;d stopped the car 20 , 50 meters down the road just in case you need help with something .
i remember the searchlight that followed me when i made the night runs from my barrack to the latrine .
we need — we don &apos;t know where this thing is going .
as a matter of fact , ethologists know this .
so what do i have to do ?
it &apos;s being resolved at the level of items , or ideas , or words , if you want .
but in most of the rest of the world , that &apos;s not the case .
and third is that their image has nothing to do with africa and with ethiopia .
so one thing slammed up against another , such as in sao paulo here .
this is a remote operated vehicle beneath the ocean .
there &apos;d be virtually no learning curve .
he &apos;s speechless , but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best orators cannot .
and she said , you know , she &apos;s 90 . she &apos;s running out of time , she said .
you &apos;re probably thinking that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
really , it &apos;s just three things this whole age will be remembered for .
it took about three to four hours to run the simulation .
the last generation &apos;s problem was , we need more food and we need it cheap .
okay , you simply wouldn &apos;t .
ot : thank you .
( laughter ) and there is some truth to this , in the sense that we have something of a finite resource , and increased growth is going to push up demand for that .
sort of leadership by humiliation .
that would save hundreds of millions of dollars in legal costs in the united states and would decrease the cost of medicine for everyone .
because it turns out that the number one cancer in women , breast cancer , is regulated by estrogen and by this enzyme aromatase .
the little lego car in the beginning of the video references the big , real car near the end of the video .
we decided to give it a try , because we thought , &quot; &quot; hey , how hard could it be ? &quot; &quot; we have already an autonomous vehicle .
and this next postcard was made out of one of those photos .
so we bought 100,000 books and sent them to india .
and is it fair to say that it &apos;s simple ?
in other words , it is theoretically possible that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable of creating human beings that glow in the dark .
so , if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs , at some stage , the next step of the ladder has to follow .
and he beat me too . but that didn &apos;t change the fact that it was a nightmare for my family ; it was a nightmare .
hopefully it won &apos;t stutter .
so what you see here is a subtraction of areas in which there &apos;s more brain activity when you &apos;re playing people compared to playing the computer .
i estimated that , just today , across the world , we spent about 106 average world lifetimes teaching people how to calculate by hand .
we also have the mathematics to describe how neurons collect information , and how they create a little lightning bolt to communicate with each other .
where had he gone ?
they &apos;re made by the gazillions in china and india , and we can source them anywhere in the world , build the chair anywhere , and most importantly repair it , even out in a village with a local bicycle mechanic who has local tools , knowledge and parts available .
here &apos;s our hamburger cutaway .
when you make an investment , what you &apos;re really saying is , &quot; &quot; i accept that any one of these 100 things could happen to me and determine my wealth . &quot; &quot; now you can try to move your outcomes around .
you &apos;re live .
but there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it .
no , no , no , shush . we &apos;ve got to go quickly .
the low estimate is the nuclear energy industry estimate of nuclear .
a few years ago , a university student asked me , &quot; what is the greatest surprise in your life ? &quot;
in the worst cases , there are simply not enough jobs in the public health sector , where most poor people are treated , not enough political will , not enough resources , not enough anything — just too many patients with no care .
and then the child turned two , and i started using the cheap and easy treatment , and i wonder &quot; &quot; — and she wondered , like all parents who lose children wonder — &quot; &quot; if there isn &apos;t something that i could have done , like keep on using that complicated , expensive cure . &quot; &quot; and she told all the other people , and she said , &quot; &quot; how could it possibly be that something that &apos;s cheap and simple works as well as something that &apos;s complicated and expensive ? &quot; &quot; and the people thought , &quot; &quot; you know , you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s very important to learn that math is a great way to do that .
because i want to show the people what does data retention mean .
fourth , we only execute 20 milliseconds &apos; worth of that strategy .
space that exists within us , and without us .
and they face limitations , constraints , they may be weak , they may be located in the wrong part of the world , they may be einstein , stuck away farming someplace in a rural village in india not being noticed , as was the case for ramanujan for a long time , a great mathematician but nobody noticed .
i &apos;ve seen all sorts of animals fall in , and what &apos;s shocking to me , is the process is pretty much the same .
so , i want to show the trailer , and then i &apos;m going to take apart one scene in detail .
he and his team had been documenting the over 4,000 lynchings of african-americans that have happened in the american south .
and he is credited with doing over 4,000 of these public surgeries , wandering around in europe , which is an astonishing number , when you think that surgery must have been a last resort .
so the question is , how can you carry a pilot around the world with an airplane that uses the same amount of energy as a big christmas tree ?
you know , i &apos;ve realized that wolfram alpha actually gives one a whole new kind of computing that one can call knowledge-based computing , in which one &apos;s starting not just from raw computation , but from a vast amount of built-in knowledge .
my mum wanted to , couldn ’ t afford it .
they &apos;re flower-feeders , and as they move from flower to flower , basically on a shopping trip at the local floral mart , they end up providing this valuable pollination service .
that i am someone who has drunk , drank , drunk of the bitter dregs of near-disaster in childhood and emerged not just unscathed but strengthened .
forty percent of municipalities self-report dumping raw or partially treated sewage into our waterways .
( laughter ) so jake cress is this furniture maker , and he makes this unbelievable set of furniture .
we proved with those measurements that crocodiles scaled isometrically .
it &apos;s certainly something he can relate to .
and the fish also were happy to be there .
he made a lot of really interesting cultural references .
i danced through chemo and radiation cycles , much to the dismay of my oncologist .
and i think part of what i &apos;m learning in this process is that one must allow oneself to feel grief .

and it turns out that they behave like quantum particles .
but you also need to have values .
for the first time in years , shi &apos;ites were allowed to make the pilgrimage to karbala to observe ashura , and i was amazed by the sheer number of people and how fervently they practiced their religion .
meanwhile , another little girl tried everything she could think of until she slid the red button , the cute doggie popped out , and she squealed with delight .
so he &apos;s got memory .
the mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra .
we &apos;ve heard a lot about the promise of technology , and the peril .
in the oil and mining sector , for example , there is now the beginning of a truly worldwide transparency standard that could tackle some of these problems .
merci . we have to prepare for the following performance , and i have a question for you , and the question is this : you show up in places like the ones you just have shown us , and you are carrying a camera and i assume that you are welcome but you are not always absolutely welcome .

a 21-year-old monk . he was very happy .
and of course , the name of the giant is goliath and the name of the shepherd boy is david , and the reason that story has obsessed me over the course of writing my book is that everything i thought i knew about that story turned out to be wrong .

and six , the work ethic .
and i think that there is an easy cure for ndd .
these were evolved in very different times — we &apos;d like to actually change those programs .
we all know .
in the case of disgust , what is a little bit more surprising is the scope of this influence . it makes perfect sense , and it &apos;s a very good emotion for us to have , that disgust would make me change the way that i perceive the physical world whenever contamination is possible .
the real question : is this distorted worldview what we want for americans in our increasingly interconnected world ?
and this nonpartisanship is something that exists , that has existed in secret in america for years and years and years .
60,000 species are known to science , but more than 1.5 million have been estimated to exist .
what about if we use a big hammer and we swing it and we hit the nail like this , in the place of putting the hammer on the nail and pushing and try to put it in ? that won &apos;t work .
they &apos;ve studied the institutions that facilitate our trade , like legal systems , corporations , marketplaces .
it &apos;s true , we &apos;ve got a huge food problem , but this isn &apos;t science .
why didn &apos;t dad say art ? why wasn &apos;t it okay ?
which i found very interesting that it was going full cycle : i was making comments about the press and about how we know facts and information only by media — because we don &apos;t know the real people ; very few of us know the real people — but it was going back into the press and they were publicizing , effectively , my filthy work .
clicking on a train wreck just pours gasoline on it .
( laughter ) up until our mother asked him to leave and not come back , bageye had been a terrifying ogre .
and so i feel so blessed with everything that i have , that two days a week i go and i counsel hiv patients .
so one squared is one , two squared is four , three squared is nine , five squared is 25 , and so on .
talking about income inequality , even if you &apos;re not on the forbes 400 list , can make us feel uncomfortable .
and yes , we africans can .
maybe it was the optimism that i had about america that made me take a while to understand that things were not going to change .
now what does this all have to do with social problems ?
i want to tell you some stories that explain my view .
so a couple of observations stand out for me from this slide .
so we asked those guys to do it again .
things get more interesting .
not necessarily , no .
here &apos;s nylon going back to caprolactam back to carpet .
in a thankfully voluntary section of okcupid , you are allowed to rate how attractive you think people are on a scale between one and five .
in fact , i &apos;ll just go into one area — if you &apos;re looking at alzheimer &apos;s , for example , drug discovery — there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out because scientists in that field realize this is a great way of getting out of those silos , because they had their genomics data in one database in one building , and they had their protein data in another .
you know , from the hindsight of history , what &apos;s always most inexplicable and inexcusable are the simple failures of compassion .
now , this was a mystery in the new york times where the honey was very red , and the new york state forensics department came in and they actually did some science to match the red dye with that found in a maraschino cherry factory down the street . ( laughter ) so you can tailor your honey to taste however you want by planting bee-friendly flowers .
you have to act compassionately .
in 1998 , human embryonic stem cells were first identified , and just nine years later , a group of scientists in japan were able to take skin cells and reprogram them with very powerful viruses to create a kind of pluripotent stem cell called an induced pluripotent stem cell , or what we refer to as an ips cell .
and where health begins is not in the four walls of a doctor &apos;s office , but where we live and where we work , where we eat , sleep , learn and play , where we spend the majority of our lives .
hey , why not ?
so , three years ago i discovered , the letters m-i-t occurring in simplicity and complexity .
because if you can &apos;t get it in nashville , you can travel to birmingham , two hours away , and you &apos;ll get it . if you can &apos;t get it in cleveland , you can go to cincinnati . we don &apos;t have that luxury , so we have to make it happen .
three things stand out : leadership , diplomacy and institutional design .
and they would coalesce for just a moment , so you could perceive that there was a chair there .
we picked three houses in the center of the community and we start here . we made a few designs , and everybody liked this design of a boy flying a kite the best .
of foremost importance is a thorough , well-organized knowledge of all that is known of the relevant entities and processes that might be involved in that domain you propose to enter .
here &apos;s a key passage where he basically describes the staircase .

they were run by an inexperienced staff , with no visual culture , no budgets for visuals — in many places there were not even art directors .
&quot; &quot; one does not put sugar in green tea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i understand , &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; that the japanese do not put sugar in their green tea , but i &apos;d like to put some sugar in my green tea . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) surprised by my insistence , the waiter took up the issue with the manager .
powerful new technologies always present enigmas .
five , the consumer society .

so here &apos;s the cool part .
computer-generated movies are really mainstream today , but it took ed and his colleagues nearly 20 years to create the first full-length c.g. movie .
that was actually caused by a school of parrot fish that had started eating it , though luckily , they lost interest before killing it .
and so then he looks at me .
and , in fact , it was a system where we would layer primarily communal spaces , stacked to more and more individual and private spaces .
this is carnegie hall .
and this is one aspect that truly fascinates me .
all these schools in texas compete with one another to achieve these milestones , and there are bonuses and various other treats that come if you beat the other schools .
we said things like , why can &apos;t people set their own salaries ?
and we go through a period of accelerating expansion , and the universe expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent , then to the dark ages , and then the first stars turn on , and they evolve into galaxies , and then later they get to the more expansive galaxies .
there is not only in china , but also in the united states there are some very small , cute but bad cats .
all three were diagnosed with lung cancer , the number one cancer killer of women in the united states today .

you can start to unpack the choices involved because of the side effects .
np : make some noise ! make some noise !
i believe we are the gold .
also we are choosing by looking at what others are choosing .
so by this way , the kid , to take care of himself , is to take care of this living object .
now because we haven &apos;t fully processed this information , it &apos;s kind of coming back to us in our pop culture in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways , where you can see that the stereotypes are changing .
i &apos;m instead just going to remind you of the point that bmi teaches us .
could you work on that problem ? &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s how gps was born .
you &apos;ve mastered fire .
so islamophobia isn &apos;t just the natural response to muslim terrorism as i would have expected .
i &apos;m an artist , so i &apos;d like to offer a modest proposal at the intersection of art , science and culture .
because it &apos;s hollow , it &apos;s lightweight , light enough to be lifted by just a few men , or , apparently , one woman .
after extensive research and testing of different materials like rubber , which i realized was too thick to be worn snugly on the bottom of the foot , i decided to print a film sensor with electrically conductive pressure-sensitive ink particles .
in the next 10 years , china will surpass the u.s.
sometimes you might put a band-aid in place to try and temporarily stop the pain .

giles was the first resident in the first house of the first charity that i set up to pioneer services for autism .
and i said , i &apos;ll measure them . they &apos;ll get a zero .
the arctic ice cap is , in a sense , the beating heart of the global climate system .
most of you said u , which is right .
it &apos;s a program through which the government could compel corporate america , it could deputize corporate america to do its dirty work for the nsa .
i can love my wife .
that &apos;s basically the difference .
because it was the temples that organized the harvest , gathered in the grain , offered it to the gods , and then offered the grain that the gods didn &apos;t eat back to the people .
we &apos;d had a great campaign , and to be honest , we &apos;d had our fair share of beer that night , but i said , &quot; &quot; you know what , i think we &apos;ve got one more bar left in us . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so we piled into a taxi , and this is our taxi driver , and i was sitting in the back seat , and he turned around and said , &quot; &quot; where are you going ? &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; hang on , that is an amazing mustache . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and he said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m doing it for movember . &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; so am i. &quot; and i said , &quot; tell me your movember story . &quot;
the temporary building is a triumph of modern industrial organization , a healthy sublimation of the urge to build , and proof that not every architectural idea need be set in stone .

they help us resist disease , and they may even be affecting our behavior .
it has eight motors , four on the knees and four on the hip .
he has since passed away , but was mentally retarded and suffers from severe bone abnormalities .
changing behavior begins with evolving beliefs .

some anthropologists call that the original affluent society .
we steamed up the windows permanently , and every hour we had a different designer come in and write these things that they &apos;ve learned into the steam in the window .
i expected them to say to rob , &quot; hold on . we &apos;re coming . &quot;
they have electricity , but the question is , how many have washing machines ?
so i &apos;m going to show you an example now .

we monitor pygmy rabbits with drones .
i mean , you lose .
i didn &apos;t do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and , well , we didn &apos;t have drugs in those days . but i did competition model airplanes .
instead of blowing a hurricane of chilled air through the stadium , we can use radiant cooling technologies , like a floor heating system where water pipes are embedded in the floor .
waiting for that recognition moment may be the best early indicator of the onset of dementia than anything that shows up clinically today .

i was awkward , insecure , and i hated it .
now typically , this doesn &apos;t lead to any overt illness .
at the bottom right is one that i built in my lab about 10 years ago , and we finally turned that into a product .
now this theory was of more than just intellectual interest to me .
so i will not really go too far into it .
it &apos;s the blockbuster comedy .
so we described these as cool boots .
back on highway 1 , i envisioned what awaited .
so what can we do about this ?

i &apos;m really getting into this now .
every sound the child hears uncorrected is muffled .

i noticed that the house was occupied .
we &apos;ve been hearing them today and yesterday and every day for decades .
so as miraculous as this might seem , unfortunately , well , it &apos;s not that great .
( applause ) june cohen : thank you . so i think many people watching this will be asking themselves the question you just raised at the end : how can they do this in their own city ?
and i got to work on a new approach for breast cancer patients that could do a better job of telling the healthy cells from the unhealthy or cancer cells .
so the ngos become part of a public government system , rather than independent of it .
and my father said , &quot; &quot; why don &apos;t you just go to school ? &quot; &quot; and they sent me off to school , just to get busy somewhere there .

every holiday i had as a young boy was in a national park .
bg : tell me in a few words about your new project , &quot; &quot; híbridos , &quot; &quot; here in brazil .
and one of the really surprising results in the last 20 years has been the discovery of other planets going around other stars .
this premieres in monaco — it &apos;s in september 2009 . if by any chance you can &apos;t make it , another idea with this project — here &apos;s this guy building his legacy through this very unusual form , through music and through the environment .
so that &apos;s definitely going to get through those 200 nanometer holes .
it &apos;s become an art form , a form of sculpture .
so the first lesson is : change and control the narrative .
i was standing , leaning against mahatma gandhi &apos;s statue .
you also know how much labor is needed .
their teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod .
now , take the same problem , chunk it into little modules , and motivations become trivial .
and then i was hearing and seeing and reading warnings from national muslim organizations saying things like , &quot; &quot; be alert , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be aware , &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in well-lit areas , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t congregate . &quot;

the people in the modern world , in the secular world , who are interested in matters of the spirit , in matters of the mind , in higher soul-like concerns , tend to be isolated individuals .
and what this project was doing was taking the effluent of these , and turning them into all of this food .
the website says , &quot; &quot; if you look , there &apos;s an individual mutation , and maybe a second , and maybe a third , and that is cancer . &quot; &quot; but , as a cancer doc , this is what i see .
we are now interdependent .
but those environments are going to be widely spaced in this universe .
you &apos;re kind of building a new type of distributed utility .
but now all of a sudden my job is very different , and my job is to be out here talking about it , talking about introversion .
and what we found was that 99 percent of the patients start to reverse the progression of their heart disease .
in a classroom with a reverberation time of 1.2 seconds , which is pretty common , this is what it sounds like .
it was very important , but mostly interesting because a kind of break , a separation between the mathematics coming from reality , on the one hand , and new mathematics coming from pure man &apos;s mind .
and he proved that you could actually teach people to do surgery using video conferencing .
and the central idea of this work is that the human mind and brain is not a single , general-purpose processor , but a collection of highly specialized components , each solving a different specific problem , and yet collectively making up who we are as human beings and thinkers .
he said that it was a project of peace and unity and that it brought people together .
and so , with funding from the bosack-kruger foundation , i got a lot of strains from these different countries and we measured their toxin production in the lab .
( laughter ) sw : at the zoo we have big cats from the jungle .
so that &apos;s not an accident that those things happen .
you can have no budgets , no people — but still can put your work to the highest possible level .
it &apos;s gotten smaller , it &apos;s got less detail , less resolve .
so they &apos;re quite beautiful , but they &apos;re beautiful because they &apos;re so smart and economical .
there was so much pain and loneliness , there &apos;s so much incredible things when you look in somebody else &apos;s eyes , because in the gaze with that total stranger , that you never even say one word — everything happened .

they &apos;re parodied , sometimes even demonized in the media for their kind of typical teenage behavior . they take risks , they &apos;re sometimes moody , they &apos;re very self-conscious .
you get that , and it &apos;s like a slap in the face .
but again and again , lived compassion brings us back to the wisdom of tenderness .
you will adapt to it and get used to it .

ca : thank you .
the next thing is that if you want to predict the effect of one species on another , if you focus only on that link , and then you black box the rest , it &apos;s actually less predictable than if you step back , consider the entire system — all the species , all the links — and from that place , hone in on the sphere of influence that matters most .

eighty thousand people spread over the entire valley .
and just as flowers spend a lot of effort trying to get pollinators to do their bidding , they &apos;ve also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them and give them to each other at times of birth and death , and particularly at marriage , which , when you think of it , is the moment that encapsulates the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another .

♫ but all the plastic ever made is still here . ♫ ♫ and no amount of closing our eyes ♫ ♫ will make it disappear . ♫ ♫ and the world can &apos;t take it ♫ ♫ very much longer . ♫ ♫ we &apos;re not going to make it ♫ ♫ unless we &apos;re smarter and stronger . ♫ ♫ the world &apos;s gonna shake itself free of our greed ♫ ♫ somehow . ♫ ♫ and the world can &apos;t take it , that you can see . ♫ ♫ if the oceans don &apos;t make it , neither will we . ♫ ♫ the world &apos;s gonna shake itself all the way free ♫ ♫ somehow . ♫
thank you .
and i believe that this is fundamentally a problem , because it doesn &apos;t really allow us to interact with our hands and capture the rich dexterity that we have in our bodies .
( laughter ) no , there &apos;s something else , something really fundamental , and it is : another reason why we don &apos;t have a good brain theory is because we have an intuitive , strongly held but incorrect assumption that has prevented us from seeing the answer .
what could it be ? &quot; &quot; so today , 100 years later , i invite you all on an incredible journey with me , a 37-year-old yale graduate and professor .
and what if we could value it a different way , so it would actually work ?
now , this is an interactive cartoon application .
my brief , as you &apos;ve just heard , is to tell you about statistics — and , to be more precise , to tell you some exciting things about statistics .
she was a state senator at the time , and we met here , at the airport , before a trip to china .
can you imagine what it would be like if amazon or ebay or google or microsoft or apple really went green and you caused that to happen ?
so we &apos;re talking about things like infill development : really sharp little changes to where we have buildings , where we &apos;re developing .
after all , the absence of a duty of care within many professions can all too easily amount to accusations of negligence , and that being the case , can we be really comfortable with the thought that we &apos;re in effect being negligent in respect of the health of our own societies and the values that necessarily underpin them ?
at the eighth stop , a girl came in with a giant duffel bag and announced she had pants for sale for a dollar — like you might sell batteries or candy on the train .
the second : keep mothers healthy , keep mothers alive , keep the children alive — no more orphans .
you see , history &apos;s rich in irony .
but i thought , perhaps the ant won &apos;t know , it &apos;ll probably move in .
someone they were kind to and cared for .
and while remixing and sharing have come to define the web as we know it , all of us can now be part of that story through simple tools that allow us to make things online .
( laughter ) the weather station &apos;s pretty interesting .
and in the same kind of trance that you can feel sometimes in the subway in new york when you &apos;re reading , there &apos;s something really soothing and easy .
for example , i saw pictures and images frequently of sadness and suffering .
i &apos;m playing around with perspectives and analogies .
all of this information is saved in a database that collects about 20,000 feelings a day .
frankly , i joined the army because college is really damn expensive , and they were going to help with that , and i joined the army because it was what i knew , and it was what i knew that i thought i could do well .
we &apos;ll have to .
creativity is essential to all of us , whether we &apos;re scientists or teachers , parents or entrepreneurs .
and interestingly enough , adam smith — the same guy who gave us this incredible invention of mass production , and division of labor — understood this .
scars that run from the middle of my chest all the way out to my outer torso .
so not the habitual architecture that instills in us the false sort of stability , but an architecture that is full of tension , an architecture that goes beyond itself to reach a human soul and a human heart , and that breaks out of the shackles of habits .
but what happened was that he had to be on medication that , at that time — diflucan , which in the states is used for yeast infections — cost 30 dollars a pill .
so that kind of motivational tool that is used actually , in and of itself , has a long-term side effect , in that every time we use a technology that uses something like public recognition or status , we &apos;re actually positively endorsing this as a good and normal thing to care about — that way , possibly having a detrimental effect on the long-term psychological well-being of ourselves as a culture .
in fact , what they did to get food was they got in their cars , drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts , came back with a week &apos;s worth of shopping , and wondered what on earth to do with it .
in the commercials , and on the boxes for the easy-bake ovens , hasbro marketed them specifically to girls .
but , this is not the beginning of the 20th century .
now why is that ?
what is wrong with the people that we have chosen ?
in the 35 years i &apos;ve been a climbing guide and taught on indoor walls , and stuff like that , the most important thing i &apos;ve learned was , guys will always try to do pull-ups .
i may get many sponsors , a lot of money , tons of interviews , and be on tv ! &quot; &quot; i thought .
you know : thank god it &apos;s monday — i get to go back to that little cubicle , those fake gray walls , and hear everybody else &apos;s conversations f or 10 hours and then go home .
it ritualizes the impact of death on families and communities .
it &apos;s really unsatisfactory having plug-in art .
and he puts his cheese sandwich over here on top of the pirate chest .
i &apos;ve taken them camping in the kelp forests of california .
our democracies rely on elections .
it blocks the left on a whole range of issues that we on the left really care about .
saint obi : i was so fascinated , you know , with those cowboy movies .
and maybe , if we want to be on surer footing , what we really want is a moral framework that will help guide us there , that will tell us what kinds of things are right and wrong in the first place , and how would we know in a given situation what to do .
it wouldn &apos;t create the volume that would fill a large space such as the cologne opera house .
well , i was born with a rare visual condition called achromatopsia , which is total color blindness , so i &apos;ve never seen color , and i don &apos;t know what color looks like , because i come from a grayscale world .
so a few examples : we &apos;re now in the era of &quot; &quot; fantastic voyage , &quot; &quot; the ipill .
at the beginning of the project , i numbered all those buildings on my sketch , and there was no real interaction with the community .
is that your final answer ?
you have no way of controlling whether it &apos;ll be used by your side or the other side , by good guys , or by bad guys .
and , using those rules , he was able to say that there are in fact only two objects with six symmetries .
i &apos;m talking about today .
there are so many things to do in this life , and if we could have a simulacrum , a digital doppelgänger of ourselves that helps us process books , do shopping , be our best friends , i believe our mind clones , these digital versions of ourselves , will ultimately be our best friends , and for me personally and bina personally , we love each other like crazy .
but the market also had bypassed low income farmers , because these systems were both too expensive , and they were constructed for fields that were too large .
we conducted about a dozen focus groups with a broad cross-section of black men , and we learned that for them , being healthy was as much about being perceived as healthy as it was about feeling healthy , and that feeling good went hand in hand with looking good .
these are the couples that don &apos;t let anything go unnoticed and allow each other some room to complain .
so i will do this .
i think it &apos;s the wrong question to ask .
so you see , roy price is a senior executive with amazon studios .
you &apos;re in an accident . you &apos;ve got two choices : you &apos;re going to die , or you &apos;re going to take the hydrogen sulfide and , say , 75 percent of you is saved , mentally .
so when you do this sort of reconstruction , if you don &apos;t use some sort of guide image or guide statistics , then you &apos;ll get a sort of confusion of different points of view , because it &apos;s ambiguous .
well , if poor old suki is in search of a mate , what would suki do to find the perfect mate ?
np : standing right there in the corner , &quot; &quot; aw , dad — listen to that . &quot; &quot; ( beatboxing ) naw , i &apos;m kidding . but you know what ?
okay . ah , there is lots of nice bright video .
they brought in hundreds of volunteers , they put them into groups , and they gave them very hard problems to solve .
we have to deal with it .
or have they established their own sort of evolutionary niche that is independent of technology ?
this book i wrote because i want to figure out life .
and medical illustration is still art .
i sort of looked at myself standing there , going , &quot; &quot; oh , jimmy , this is complete loads of codswallop .
my hope is we can actually turn what might be a high-risk moon shot into something that &apos;s more reliable .
i was in india , and i was walking down the streets , and i saw a billboard painter .
it keeps it from being the u.n.
they have been forced off their lands .
or his restaurant , pod , in philadelphia , pennsylvania .
i think the end of the story of the whaleship essex offers an illuminating , if tragic , example .
we walked through these slums , identified houses where children would never go to school .
you can see if someone &apos;s a smoker , you can see what kind of music they like , you can see if they &apos;re going to bring their dog along for the ride .
please join them . turn off your air conditioning and turn on your fans . &quot; &quot; and wouldn &apos;t you know it , they did .
and i wore it whenever i could , thinking it was the most fabulous thing i owned .
kids do worse in the more unequal societies .
xk : do you have a perspective — i don &apos;t want to use &quot; &quot; angle &quot; &quot; because that has a negative connotation — but do you know how this is going to play out ? ( ms : no idea . ) david cohn : how much money does it take to do this ?
however , i will show to you now that we do not need to go to mars to explore alien worlds .
and so i got myself a job and i was working for a consultancy , and we would get in to these meetings , and these managers would come in , and they would say , &quot; well , what we &apos;re going to do here is really important , you know . &quot;
it &apos;s the reason we &apos;re not in the dark ages anymore .
but who is going to want to plug them in ?
but to get it , they would have to &#91; get &#93; it signed by one of the women .
and other people would draw stick figures or smiley faces .
in 1988 , a logging company convinced local residents that there would be absolutely no environmental impact from a new method they were trying called &quot; &quot; selective logging , &quot; &quot; taking out a tree here and there rather than clear-cutting a whole area .
women &apos;s ability to find the right word rapidly , basic articulation goes up in the middle of the menstrual cycle , when estrogen levels peak .
and somehow , tapirs are still there , which gives me a lot of hope .
so that nervous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , tremendously sped up the whole process of evolution .
five to seven percent only are inspected — five to seven percent .
what phenomenon — if it &apos;s not a desert , what phenomenon makes water gush from the ground into the atmosphere with such power that it can be seen from space ?
she rocketed to the top of her class .
in the science of today , we become artists .
we cannot only have grateful experiences .
look at this cartoon by roz chast , the guy reading the obituary .
this is our roof in new york , the roof of the studio .
we also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of 13 related organisms , and we tried to compare all of those , to see what they had in common .
they are shaping the way we consume .
( music : &quot; &quot; rapper &apos;s delight &quot; &quot; by the sugarhill gang ) the mc would improvise lyrics in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies .
but of course , that &apos;s a little bit like kissing your sister as far as driving a car , so the kids want to do a steering wheel ; so they draw a steering wheel .
( applause ) chris asked me to add — the theater is under construction , and this project will start construction in about a year , and finish in 2010 .
( tapping ) so my artistic practice is all about listening to the weird and wonderful noises emitted by the magnificent celestial objects that make up our universe .
a total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear .
the center of life is water .
through constant experimentation with materials , they developed a wide range of iconic solutions that we know today , eventually resulting in , of course , the legendary lounge chair .
and to boot , there was no name for this problem .
for all the scare stories , the actual actions of investors spoke of rapid acceptance and confidence .
and then accounting for things like my shaky voice , and i knew i would be singing about a half-octave higher than normal , because i was nervous .
as a young magician , i was obsessed with houdini and his underwater challenges .
i got tons and tons of generosity from everyone involved .
some of you have seen the flag .
he was looking for a heart attack , that &apos;s what i say .
we &apos;re not doing that well when it comes to insurance .
walk the talk .
so here are some of the works i would like to show you .
but i intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible .
in fact , this effect is so strong that when someone gets a college degree , the spillover effects of this on the wages of others in the metropolitan area are actually greater than the direct effects .
it &apos;s a pretty simplistic approach to root cause analyses .
we &apos;ve had the internet in its public form for almost 20 years now , and it &apos;s still changing as the media becomes more social .
and also for the men alongside whom they served .
thank you .
and so , here you go .
so , thank you . ( applause ) well , i tell you that story because it wasn &apos;t unique to britain .
in the next month , the end of december , you &apos;ll see ovarian cancer , and then lung cancer will come several months after .
it cannot be because of some broadcast mechanism affecting everyone uniformly .
politics has come to resemble a cynical team game played by politicians , while the public has been pushed aside as if sitting on the seats of a stadium in which passion for politics is gradually making room for blindness and desperation .
and as these technologies go forward , you keep seeing this , you keep seeing this , you keep seeing things — 2000 , human genome sequence — and it seems like nothing &apos;s happening , until it does .
we want to avoid death , and the dream of doing that in this body in this world forever is the first and simplest kind of immortality story , and it might at first sound implausible , but actually , almost every culture in human history has had some myth or legend of an elixir of life or a fountain of youth or something that promises to keep us going forever .
and so i think we &apos;re ready to tackle one of the most important questions in neuroscience : how are the brains of men and women different ?
no relationship — gay , straight or anything — that we would regard as remotely healthy or functional looks like that , and yet somehow , you put it on prime time , you slap some makeup on it , throw the glitter on , put it out there as movement , not as text , and we , as a culture , tune in and clap .
and you can see in these central images here , scanning electron micrographs of some of these guys — these are gardens of these bacteria .
a few years before he died , after he had resumed writing poetry , but in secret , he confessed to a friend in a letter that i found when i was doing my research : &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve written a verse .
&quot; yahweh is our savior &quot; means &quot; he has saved the nation of israel , &quot; which at the time , was a pretty high-level social organization .
of course , the criminal justice system treats them as common old garden criminals .
now , it turns out , though , that there are several problems with this model .
the moment you admit to loving someone , you admit to having a lot to lose , and it &apos;s true that these questions do provide a mechanism for getting to know someone quickly , which is also a mechanism for being known , and i think this is the thing that most of us really want from love : to be known , to be seen , to be understood .
he wanted to continue to higher education , but due to his family living on the poverty line , he was soon sent to south africa to work and send back money to feed his family .
they &apos;re not just simple , dumbed-down things that we see in school math .
this is a german orchestra , yes ?
but once you also have people living in close proximity to each other , one of the things you can do is — as information technologies develop — you can start to have smart places .
with my new venture , marilyn monrobot , i would like to use art to create tech .
he &apos;s coached five olympians , and the man &apos;s office is lined from floor to ceiling with all america certificates of all these athletes he &apos;s coached .
audience member 2 : the king .
here &apos;s an example of this similarity .
turns out , ucla has an entire history of pain collection in their archives .
these are stem cells that we create from specific sources , and we can drive them to become heart cells , and they start beating in culture .
maybe you had a direct line .
i was fired five minutes after that .
in every aspect of their lives , they wished for progress , just as we do .
now we get to fight about all sorts of other issues .
now , it &apos;s quite possible that a future martin luther king or a mandela or a gandhi will have an iphone and be protected from government surveillance .
we called legal seafood — ( laughter ) we ordered a bunch of shrimp shells , we grinded them and we produced chitosan paste .
they would make a little bit more money ; their standard of living would shift and would get better .
that &apos;s a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do math , i &apos;m sure .
now the problem with the robots doing this is that they can &apos;t get unstuck , with the material .
these are zebra fish . they &apos;re normally black and silver .
so basically , china is a sick bric country .
( applause ) thank you .
when i was in the third grade , a monumental event happened .
so if we want to utilize self-assembly in our physical environment , i think there &apos;s four key factors .
the nepali women who were trafficked into the sex trade — they came together , and they decided that they were going to make the world &apos;s first anti-trafficking organization actually headed and run by trafficking survivors themselves .
this one , i would say , was a serious challenge .
and now i really like sort of sitting up , you know .
there are many promised lands , depending on your station in society , depending on your stage of life .
let &apos;s talk for a moment about what a model for processing visual information would need to do .
maps matter .
thank you all so much .
copying with variation and selection .
look at a hand . look at a remote control . chair . book .
why should we get away from those arguments ?
let &apos;s not forget these men , who are truly dying to work .
jabbar : then what about the rest of us ?
what experiments would you run ?
what i &apos;m going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas .
now , these people will make guesses , they &apos;ll say things like , &quot; &quot; why am i getting electricity ?
and their response , of course , was no more than we wanted to stop the genocide and put our troops in harm &apos;s way to do that , nor do we now want to get in the way and pluck genocidaires from camps .
b and v , as we said before , were never differentiated in the spanish language — ( applause ) let &apos;s choose one ; it could be either . we can discuss it , talk it over .
if we want humanity to last forever , we have to colonize the milky way .
it &apos;s thoroughly modern biggie .
and ultimately , we have to try that .
when these particles get to the road , they sense some kind of obstacle , and they bounce against it .
and michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt .
i bought some super sculpeys , some armature wire , some various materials .
it provoked tears as well as incisive questions about unarmed peace-keeping forces and the double-dealing of a western society that picks its moral fights with commodities in mind .
and if our fates are intertwined , then we believe that it is good karma , it is good fortune .
and here were are . we have a continuum in the world .
this is the basis for the device that these two guys at ford built .
what is completely lacking is a class of people who have immense amounts of power , but no money at all .
i do a lot of work for the school of visual arts , where i teach , and the director of this school — a remarkable man named silas rhodes — often gives you a piece of text and he says , &quot; &quot; do something with this . &quot; &quot; and so he did .
well , we asked thousands of people .
but we &apos;re coming to appreciate , is the transition from 2d to 3d , from programming bits to programming atoms , turns the ends of moore &apos;s law scaling from the ultimate bug to the ultimate feature .
what do you want in terms of medical intervention ?
thank you .
the only thing singing today would be the facts , for i have truly embraced by inner nerd .
my first semester in spanish , i got a d.
and we shall see what will happen with these countries .
i &apos;ve been part of a social movement that has been working on ending violence against women and children .
don &apos;t feel ashamed .
this is certainly not a cure for spinal cord injury , but i begin to believe that this may lead to an intervention to improve recovery and people &apos;s quality of life .
i wouldn &apos;t be able to talk about this here unless i had done it a few times .
now imagine that women are represented here , and men are represented here .
those of you who are from boston know that this was the moment — rare — where the red sox won the world series .
another thing is the answer was there all along , but we kind of ignored it because of this obvious thing .
so in my group , what we try to do is reverse engineer how humans control movement .
but not everyone can afford an iphone .
what i &apos;m pitching you today is actually not a stand-alone product .
it didn &apos;t come down by a verdict of somebody else .
it &apos;s a huge network under the surface of the tepui plateau , and in only ten days of expedition , we explored more than 20 kilometers of cave passages .
the first of these is natural selection — that &apos;s random mutation and selective retention — along with our basic anatomy and physiology — the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails .
and why can they serve that much ?
i do so many things on this little device .
&quot; &quot; the hour from night to day .
why do we respond so much to our knowledge of where something comes from ?
now this noise is so great that society places a huge premium on those of us who can reduce the consequences of noise .
they &apos;re changing the scale of what we can do , and what we &apos;ve developed is something we call fftt , which is a creative commons solution to building a very flexible system of building with these large panels where we tilt up six stories at a time if we want to .
first one is the political system .
as i said to you , this is the first time i &apos;ve shown this in public .
we depend on the fact that audiences , such as yourselves , will make assumptions .
i &apos;m a performer .
whether you &apos;re in the hierarchy or the heterarchy , it &apos;s a wonderful design challenge .
the challenge is we don &apos;t know the shape of the extra dimensions .
on your left side , you have &quot; &quot; operation smile . &quot; &quot; it is a computer-generated map of a social network .
these include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight .
but it &apos;s not just about policing government .
and the key is to promote a positive african attitude towards africa .
and this is a technically creative challenge , and it would change the perspective of people who worked on it .
judge forer quits , and ms. dewey in completely disheartened .
she was earning 450 dollars . she was doing okay .
william gregory was convicted of rape and burglary .
and the organization draws together people of different generations , like holly morgan , who &apos;s an undergraduate , who &apos;s pledged to give 10 percent of the little amount that she has , and on the right , ada wan , who has worked directly for the poor , but has now gone to yale to do an mba to have more to give .
but if i had to get a match to match , obviously , i would need a different design of a cellphone .
i &apos;ve actually got a website that &apos;s got a bunch of photos that i &apos;ve done of some of the other folks i didn &apos;t get a chance to show you .
the root mechanism of a dragon-king is a slow maturation towards instability , which is the bubble , and the climax of the bubble is often the crash .
stars will orbit the black hole in the very same way that planets orbit the sun .
it &apos;s way more energetic .
and in all these 42 cases , when we kept pushing them back , there was three kinds of reaction .
and the colors here represent the motivation behind the money .
here &apos;s a classic example : rebecca has a benign blood vessel tumor that &apos;s growing out through her skull , has obliterated her nose , and she &apos;s having difficulty seeing .
how might we improve access to safe drinking water for the world &apos;s poorest people , and at the same time stimulate innovation amongst local water providers ?
and just imagine the sense of wonder in a baby when it first discovers that , merely by uttering a sound , it can get objects to move across a room as if by magic , and maybe even into its mouth .
we argue strongly that the people living in the house are simply not the problem .
i suppose it &apos;s there to tell you that somebody &apos;s cleaned the place , and it &apos;s all lovely .
i spoke up a little more at work .
&quot; &quot; this headscarf and these clothes , &quot; &quot; she says , &quot; &quot; give me the freedom to do what i need to do to speak to those whose support and assistance are critical for this work .
and then i thought , &quot; &quot; nah , that wouldn &apos;t be very nice . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) that attitude of only taking what you need was really what everybody had on the network in those days , and in fact , it wasn &apos;t just the people on the network , but it was actually kind of built into the protocols of the internet itself .
so , as we have faced liability , we have stepped back and back , and unfortunately , where there is liability , guess what there is : power .
they had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention .
and so what had happened , really , is that we found ourselves in a perceptual shift .
so we &apos;ve been working with transport for london , and that organization hasn &apos;t actually been responsible as a client for a new bus for 50 years .
i &apos;m going to ask and try to answer , in some ways , kind of an uncomfortable question .
child : um , yeah .
or this poor man who kept his diploma — he went to university of michigan , but he never would talk about his poverty as a youngster , ever — just would not mention it .
an average african country receives foreign aid to the tune of 13 , 15 percent of its gdp , and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources from rich countries to poor countries .
it was bad .
i have a friend in portugal whose grandfather built a vehicle out of a bicycle and a washing machine so he could transport his family .
modern technology is not going to change who we choose to love .
and then when it &apos;s time to go , a green light goes and the jumpmaster goes , &quot; &quot; go . &quot; &quot; the first guy goes , and you &apos;re just in line , and you just kind of lumber to the door .
and that &apos;s a really fascinating thing about this approach .
( applause ) i don &apos;t know if we have any statisticians in the house , but there &apos;s definitely something going on . ( laughter )
it &apos;s mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals .
we &apos;re about to do six in the u.k. next week .
you &apos;ve got the pictures you &apos;ve taken .
they are believed to have magical powers .
maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery .
who knew about extension managers ?
we showed this to the hotel people the other day , and they were terrified and said that nobody would come to the ritz-carlton anymore , because of this fish .
when the shopping center died , the city restored the site &apos;s original wetlands , creating lakefront property , which then attracted private investment , the first private investment to this very low-income neighborhood in over 40 years .
that means we get our new hips for free .
so everyone who came into contact with ella or a family like ella &apos;s would spend 80 percent of their time working with the families and only 20 percent servicing the system .
( applause ) chris anderson : quick question .
they are growing in political clout , as the mullahs are isolating themselves — with the exception of one group of mullahs , who are not well known to americans .
and if you do lavish as much technique as possible , and you try to make the highest quality hamburger , it gets to be a little bit involved .
he &apos;s an amnesic who had , very possibly , the worst memory in the world .
inside the rolls-royce is the queen mother .
so i want to talk about that as an opportunity that we really have failed to engage with very well in this country and , in fact , worldwide .
what &apos;s the regulation of the reserve and what is the regulation of the parks ?
right now that &apos;s all cleared out — this was done about eight months ago — and high-rises are now going up into that central spot .
a billion people , 1 / 6th of the world population .
that &apos;s like comparing the population of the world to the population of los angeles , proportionally speaking .
i &apos;m a sophomore and studying communications , tv and mass media , and basically trying to live life like a normal kid , which i always wanted growing up .
it was a concert he recorded in the shrine auditorium in 1949 .
it was a really wonderful experience , but when i got home , i suddenly felt very disconnected and suddenly shut in and shut out , and i was really surprised by those feelings .
it says a lot about her .
they digest our food , they make our vitamins , they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out .
so it &apos;s important to remember that whether it &apos;s good or it &apos;s bad , &quot; this too shall pass . &quot;
when i was a boy , in front of every house in the summer evenings , you would find young people together singing the songs of the day , or the old songs .
and their love &#91; for studying &#93; was so big that i cried .
you &apos;re just kind of moving around .
technology is just generally being used to allow us to create in as shared and social a way as possible .
you can look at the statistics , the frequency of the occurrence of peak-to-valleys of different sizes , which is represented in this graph .
the basic idea is they aggregate to form large groups , or swarms .
so i asked myself : okay , is this a model for creation , this adaptation that we do ?
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll be content together . &quot; &quot; he never used my nickname again .
now it &apos;s just five times , and soon it will be 2.5 times .
so that keeps me coming back .
and the more time you spend looking at this , the more things you also will see in the clouds .
we are talking about the cradle of democracy .
it &apos;s a composite view that &apos;s constantly changing and being updated .
there &apos;s quite a lot of people that are eating insects .
director 2 : can you not shut up ?
in germany , we are pushing the ratification of the un convention , which is a subsequent convention .
and we have the greatest chance of success if we recognize our vulnerability .
so who are these scientists and engineers at a magical place called darpa ?
let &apos;s see what happens here .
a little background : when my grade five was learning about child rights , they were made to roll incense sticks , agarbattis , for eight hours to experience what it means to be a child laborer .
we can make food more important , not less , and save ourselves by doing so .
it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; are you smarter than a fifth grader ? &quot; &quot; i think we &apos;ve learned the answer to that here .
thank you .
so the hindenburg wasn &apos;t , you know , it was inevitable it was going to go .
and this is a particularly small scooter for a gentleman of this size .
and brian allen was able , in a miraculous flight , to get the gossamer albatross across the english channel , and we won the 100,000-pound , 200,000-dollar prize for that .
any parents out there of teenagers ? all we do is cook for these people — they eat two , three , four dinners a night — it &apos;s ridiculous !
and then he said , &quot; &quot; what you do for the least of these , you do for me . &quot; &quot; now i was pretty psyched .
so the key thing in terms of these new tools that are kind of plumbing the depths of the global brain , that are sending kind of trace dyes through that whole bloodstream — the question is , are you finding out something new ?
and so you wouldn &apos;t sit that close to another person because of your notion that it &apos;s you versus the universe — that &apos;s all buddha discovered .
this turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans .
that first three years , ok , that was just what we couldn &apos;t solve for .
of course , when you digitize , that &apos;s not enough , because these documents , most of them are in latin , in tuscan , in venetian dialect , so you need to transcribe them , to translate them in some cases , to index them , and this is obviously not easy .
and the problem of poor vision , is actually not just a health problem , it &apos;s also an educational problem , and it &apos;s an economic problem , and it &apos;s a quality of life problem .
child : oh my god ! how did you do that ?
that &apos;s not the southwest season .
the majority of the planet , aspiring for development , having the right for development , are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle , a momentous pressure .
giraffes are this desire in the dark . &quot; &quot; this is important .
we &apos;ll start off easy .
our boat was floating like a matchbox on the water without any control .
and the fact that the polar bear and husky or magpie and a bear or you and i and our dogs can crossover and have that experience sets play aside as something separate .
and what you can really think of xml in this case is it &apos;s the packaging that we &apos;re putting around these pages .
as we saw with the teacher in cody , wyoming , she seems to be affected by the law .
so , for example , when you touch a pencil , microbial exchange happens .
you know , i &apos;m a middle class white man . i have no race , no class , no gender .
and now , for the first time , i can do something fun .
for example , i recently wrote an article in the new yorker magazine , but i can &apos;t afford to buy an ad in it .
and what this quantification showed us is that , upon experiencing a train of these air puffs , the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyperactivity which is persistent , long-lasting , and also appears to be graded .
now that argument , i made that argument 30 — oh my god , i don &apos;t want to think about it — more than 30 years ago , but there &apos;s a deeper argument implicit in what i &apos;ve told you , and i want to tell you that argument briefly , and that is , consciousness creates an observer-independent reality .
but there &apos;s a cost to this elegant unification , because years of research have shown that the math of string theory doesn &apos;t quite work .
but the problem is , there &apos;s only so much you can take , and also when you do that operation , your patients might actually have significant pain in that defect site even two years after the operation .
and people who live in cities in the developed world tend to be very prosperous , and thus use a lot of stuff .

a recent report by the pew center on trends in america indicates that only 10 percent of young adults under the age of 30 &quot; place a lot of trust in the media . &quot;
it helped us exaggerate what we were afraid of , and we seek causality where there is none , and we then get an illusion of confidence where we believe that we are the best car drivers , above the average .
but there are still over 650 million indians , pakistanis , sri lankans , bangladeshis , nepalese , who remain washed up on the shores of poverty .
nothing to worry about , right ?
and i wouldn &apos;t say that is the wrong thing in all circumstances .
she could have called her my friend , or my &quot; &quot; friend , &quot; &quot; or my &quot; &quot; special friend &quot; &quot; — ( laughter ) — or even worse , just not asked at all .
or should they be given an alternative standard of care , such as the best current treatment available in the country in which the research is being conducted ?
what was also clear was that people really wanted to know a lot more about how the technology would look and feel , and that there was really much more interest in this than we had ever thought possible .
so we take this just completely for granted .
of course , it &apos;s not all about food ; it &apos;s also about kids getting exercise .
i &apos;m a copy editor .
so here &apos;s an object , and in this case , it &apos;s a wire figure in the shape of a human , and we &apos;re going to film that object with just a regular camera .
so , i always tell my students , &quot; work smart , then work hard . &quot;
in fact , she indicated that if we would do that , not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude from the members of the extended family , but she said , &quot; &quot; even god will smile , and when god smiles , there is peace , and justice , and joy . &quot; &quot; so , at the table at 915 , i learned something about compassion .
and so our project is seeking to look at this readout , understanding which of these 25,000 genes is turned on .
sweet — energy .
crucially , asperger viewed autism as a diverse continuum that spans an astonishing range of giftedness and disability .
so when we want to learn whether a planet is habitable , whether it might be amenable to life , we want to know not only how much total light it receives and how warm it is , but we want to know about its space weather — this high-energy radiation , the uv and the x-rays that are created by its star and that bathe it in this bath of high-energy radiation .
it &apos;s one of those things , we got by just fine before we had to do any of those .
then you look at the phenomenon of kogi .
on one hand , on the left bank of the river , are the people like me who study those planets and try to define the environments .
and then we &apos;ll put on a satellite tag that will give us the long-distance journeys with the light-based geolocation algorithms solved on the computer that &apos;s on the fish .
very much in the same way , it &apos;s very difficult to see astronomical sources , because of the atmosphere that &apos;s continuously moving by .
i mean , if i got to go to tedx usc my life wouldn &apos;t suck . but i don &apos;t . so it does . &quot; &quot; if that &apos;s how you talked , imagine what kind of work would get done .
however , what i have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music .
on the left side , you see the yield produced using conventional agriculture , with a 100 percent phosphorus dose .
further to the right is more .
and because of that , then a lot of singers started saying , &quot; all right , what &apos;s virtual choir 2.0 ? &quot;
and they were interested in developing a new , alternative art space , and they needed funding for it , so they decided to come up with some interesting fundraising projects .
musician and natural soundscape expert bernie krause describes how a healthy environment has animals and insects taking up low , medium and high-frequency bands , in exactly the same way as a symphony does .
of course , you can &apos;t copy and paste education systems wholesale , but these comparisons have identified a range of factors that high-performing systems share .
girls were prohibited from going to school .
now to the funds we raise , and research , and how we &apos;re redefining research .
and i &apos;ve got to tell you , what i found out in the world in four different continents , was depressingly familiar .
the u.s. is actually becoming a bit of a leader in kind of enlightened urban planning and renewal , and i want to single out a place like chicago , where i look at some guy like mayor daley as a bit of a design hero for being able to work through the political processes and all that to improve an area .
this leads me to the second thing that you would learn in your 30-minute exploration of drug violence in mexico .
it kind of makes you wonder about our own time .
everything started breaking .
whereas the film yesterday that we saw of the simulation of the inside of a cell , as a former molecular biologist , i didn &apos;t like that at all .
and that &apos;s what we do to all traffic survivors .
dare i admit that after she did it i never really loved her again ?
and in the context of particular courses , you can ask questions like , what are some of the misconceptions that are more common and how do we help students fix them ?
french parents were more likely to say things like , &quot; &quot; noah was here for so little time , but he taught us so much .
it &apos;s actually not very hard . ninety-eight percent of cases , this is a piece of cake .
when something changes , what happens to those properties ?
the present always contains the past .
but actually these , like i said , are still the actual prototype .
compared to your regular friends , they are boring and dull , right ? because in this new context , the comparison is very , very different . in fact , you find yourself disliking them enough almost to qualify for french citizenship .
so a kid who &apos;s 14 in high school gets this version of the pythagorean theorem , which is a truly subtle and interesting proof , but in fact it &apos;s not a good way to start learning about mathematics .
a few years ago , the number of babies dying in their first year of life in the world fell by five percent in just one year .
but i quite love the way it &apos;s posed .
and we did actually start calling ourselves martians .
that &apos;s how wally got hired .
and that chain link is really expensive .
but abed did not slow , and on that xeroxed piece of paper , my neck again broke , and again , i was left without anger .
&#91; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &#93; orange , good . &#91; &quot; &quot; table &quot; &quot; &#93; green .
many scientists can now grow many different types of cells .
and the women are diligent . they are focused ; they work hard .
which group loses the most weight , we give them prizes .
and , as you can see , the death rate goes down from 65,000 deaths per conflict per year in the 1950s to less than 2,000 deaths per conflict per year in this decade , as horrific as it is .
we tended gardens , we became interested in organic food , we knew or we were vegetarians .
( laughter ) my father taught me how to walk when i was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking .
it has no consciousness .
and we take the nerve away from your chest muscle and let these nerves grow into it .
so he taught me that physics is cool because it teaches us so much about the world around us .
and then , again , the building itself , middle of los angeles , right across from city hall .
it &apos;s as big as any of the biggest trees east of the mississippi river , and yet it &apos;s only a minor feature on chronos .
and there &apos;s the sheep .
this is not some game of thrones empire-level set of questions .
to our knowledge they had no music .
as you know , we are very interested in humanoid robot , human walking , so we decided to build a small humanoid robot .
build it from scratch proposed that it was time for a whole new system .
and these preservatives had been found in breast cancer tumors .
the purpose of these images is to inspire you , to motivate you , so that we can look at them and think , &quot; &quot; well , however bad my life is , it could be worse .
one of the things that happened right around world war ii in that same time period before , and as sure as hell afterwards , government got — realized that scientists aren &apos;t strange dudes that , you know , hide in ivory towers and do ridiculous things with test tube .
what about athens ? mediterranean climate , but in the sun it was not comfortable . they didn &apos;t perceive comfort .
thank you so much .
they &apos;re healthy ; they &apos;re clean — it &apos;s amazing .
china burns half the world &apos;s coal each year , and that &apos;s why , it is a key reason why , it is the world &apos;s largest emitter of greenhouse gases .
i think a lot of families are fractured by unrealistic expectations that are based upon this false vision of human sexuality .
it was like the waiting room in the doctor &apos;s office .
very recently , with collaborators , we studied a dynamical system where you see the dragon-king as these big loops and we were able to apply tiny perturbations at the right times that removed , when control is on , these dragons .
and over the last two years , 2,000 people has been crippled in the southern tip of bandundu region .
so i classify the people into three : uneducated , little educated , surplus educated .
but at the same time it was also impossible not to see the human vitality , the aspiration and the ambition of the people who live there : women washing their babies , washing their clothes , hanging them out to dry .
i study ants , and that &apos;s because i like to think about how organizations work .
rw : do you want me to hold you or not ? dh : don &apos;t hold me that hard .
just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property — no flower was damaged in the process of this shot ; it was just attached to the tripod , not killed — then under ultraviolet light , look at that .
some will be down to two or three .
not very well , it turns out . i can &apos;t do that .
and so if you ask this question : where would you look to see the future of education ?
and i want to take a moment to honor these house republicans — ( applause ) who had the courage last fall to step out and take a political risk , by telling the truth about the climate crisis .
by the time i left , we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars . and as we speak now , we have about 40 billion dollars in reserves due to proper management of our finances .
it can get sideways like a rally car driver , always able to take the tightest curve , even on slippery , changing surfaces , never spinning out .
it was vital in the transition , but what fascinated me was , in the transition to what ? what could actually work ?
very , very simple .
we will know that we &apos;re not that miracle , right , that we &apos;re just another duck in a row , we &apos;re not the only kids on the block , and i think that that &apos;s philosophically a very profound thing to learn .
if we do that , we not only get the jobs , we get the improvements in public infrastructure , the restoration of public infrastructure .
but seriously , would anyone like to choose a piece ?
so that leaves a couple of places like iran , maybe venezuela , that you would like to have very close surveillance of anything that goes on with fissile stuff .
( applause ) and in the first year , i had to fire half of the men .
so part of our understanding of this was given to us by ludwig boltzmann , an austrian physicist in the 19th century .

and i look at , on your show , actually , i kind of lost my voice , and i haven &apos;t gotten it back .
he &apos;s obviously not joanne — so we &apos;ll &quot; &quot; add user . &quot; &quot; evan . okay .

so , there &apos;s all kinds of bacteria on the earth that have no business being in you or on you at any time , and if they are , they make you incredibly sick .
another thing it &apos;s good for is navigation — it can guide you around in a city .
so , the way of treating these diseases in early times was to , in some way or other , exorcise those evil spirits , and this is still going on , as you know .
this is based on an f. scott fitzgerald short story .
the president dismissed the secretary of state , whom he was conferring with , and asked the dentist if he would remove a tooth .
so we collect this mr.
so , but i think whether you own your own company or you &apos;re just starting out like me , like something like this is so vital for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning .
and my , then , five year-old daughter was helping me in the way that five year-olds do .
but if i think about it , i thought i wanted a husband , but what i really wanted was a family that was loving . and i fiercely love my children , and they love me back . &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; i thought that i wanted to be a doctor , but what i really wanted to be was somebody who served and healed and cured .
so what we can do , again , using spatiotemporal features , we looked at every shot .
but there is not a day that goes by where i am not so grateful to be married to this man ; where i &apos;m not so grateful for the possibility of changing minds , and rewarding conversations , and creating a world where love belongs to us all .
so , that &apos;s a challenge , not just for organs but also for tissues .
a couple months later , news of this proposal got leaked to the press and now there are thousands of articles , over 10,000 articles , on this star alone .

the twist is that one player , on the left , is informed about how much on each trial there is .
i remember one night when someone phoned me on my cellphone — ordinary person who i don &apos;t know — from tahrir square .
it was in constant flux , and we had to , rather than fight it , embrace it , see where the milk would take us and compensate to make it even better .
actually , you have to put a circle around that , and call it business .
sometimes you can make some horrible choices with them .
and i think this is partly where there is such a divide of opinion , that there &apos;s a lot of people in this room and around the world who think very differently about the internet .
learning the information that has accumulated over time and reading the message left by my ancestors were better than any consolation therapy or piece of advice any living adults could give me .
there were 8,000 kinds of notes in america .
if every commercially minded cosmetic surgeon were tied end to end along a railroad track , that would be me , stoking the train without a qualm in the world .

fireworms scrawl white lines as they feed .
they sort of say the harsh news , that we are facing the largest transformative development since the industrialization .

these countries took those strategies i just showed you ; the community engagement , the case finding , contact tracing , etc . , and they turned them on their head .
had something gotten in his wound that killed him ?
does anyone here know the company multi-health systems ?
so really , just an amazing image , slowed down extremely , to extremely slow speeds .
so this is important .
second of all , we should really strive to use far less energy in creating these materials .
charles used to say , &quot; &quot; the extent to which you have a design style is the extent to which you have not solved the design problem . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s kind of a brutal quote .
the reality , unfortunately , is a little different , and it has a lot to do with trust , or a lack of it .
they &apos;re already the largest trading nation , already the largest exporting nation , already the largest manufacturing nation , and they &apos;re also the biggest emitters of carbon in the world .
the way we expect the world to be changes the way we see it .
i ordered them ; they came by fedex .

it &apos;s opt-in . you might even get texas and south carolina , who didn &apos;t opt into the education race to the top , you might even get them to opt in . why ?
dr. samuel cartwright graduated from the university of pennsylvania medical school .

i learned new characters every day during the course of the next 15 years .
and this is where i have to query all of you .
and finally , lots of people are saying that yemen &apos;s revolution is going to break the country .
it pays for itself within one year .

and that little square in the corner , a naught .7 percent , that &apos;s the amount we &apos;re actually aware of .
i &apos;ve got a question for randi .
you end up isolated if you don &apos;t cultivate the capacity for solitude , the ability to be separate , to gather yourself .

the us defense department has long warned of consequences from the climate crisis , including refugees , food and water shortages and pandemic disease .
it is not a sprint .
now , what we need is , we need people who will be able to scale them up .

and remember , paths crossed in 1984 , and more and more women were dying of cardiovascular disease .
so he asked me , could he please visit me , and then finally he did , and explained to me that what i did now in my shop was an anachronism , that the industrial revolution had broken out , and that i rather should join the factory .
this is fourier &apos;s law of heat conduction .
and no two people could disagree about what the word free was and what the word falafel was , behind us , &quot; &quot; free falafel . &quot; &quot; you know .
so we &apos;re talking about an investment that in terms of impacts on the state economy is not going to really pay off for 15 or 20 years , and of course america is notorious for being a short term-oriented society .
i felt so incredibly grateful for my life .
so that being said , it &apos;s highly unlikely that any jellyfish would survive that long in the wild .
we talked to pharmaceutical companies .
can i do that one again ?
it must be a machine . &quot; &quot; so i says , &quot; &quot; ok then , if you say it &apos;s a machine ... &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) ( applause ) that one took me approximately six weeks . ( applause )
a chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters .
we found remains of giant predatory dinosaurs , medium-sized predatory dinosaurs , and seven or eight different kinds of crocodile-like hunters .

additionally , these sort of edenic places are often distant from where people live .
iraq will still be the second largest oil producer in the world , behind saudi arabia .
and , you see , this era coincided with my own childhood .
i believe that these tools that worked in these 42 pilot cases can be consolidated in standard processes in a bpo kind of environment , and made available on web , call-center and franchise physical offices , for a fee , to serve anyone confronted with a demand for a bribe .
( laughter ) now , i &apos;m convinced a lot of you probably share my passions , especially my passion for &quot; &quot; judge judy , &quot; &quot; and you &apos;d fight anybody who attempted to take her away from us , but i &apos;m a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life , a passion for the live professional performing arts , performing arts that represent the orchestral repertoire , yes , but jazz as well , modern dance , opera , theater and more and more and more .
first of all , we wanted small schools — about 300 , 400 pupils — 14 to 19 year-olds , and critically , about 80 percent of the curriculum done not through sitting in classrooms , but through real-life , practical projects , working on commission to businesses , ngo &apos;s and others .
and therefore , it &apos;s not a matter of opinion .
i believe in you .
that &apos;s the challenge . okay , so , now , what we — in the journey of wheat , let &apos;s go back and look at these 12 stages .
so this is target , the company .
this cooperative ability has interesting implications for economic planning and a variety of other fields .
that &apos;s my daughter and me .

more than 700 of these boats , which are fishermen boats repurposed with oil absorbent in white and oil containment in orange , were used , but they only collected three percent of the oil on the surface , and the health of the cleaners were very deeply affected .
and when we did , my dad would say , &quot; &quot; can you believe someone climbed a tree over there , picked this thing off it , put it in a truck , drove it all the way to the docks and then sailed it all the way across the atlantic ocean and then put it in another truck and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house , so they could sell it to us for 25 cents ? &quot; &quot; and i &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t believe that . &quot; &quot; and he &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t believe it either .
for two straight days , the city became an open battlefield between the federal forces and a well-organized group , presumably from the local criminal organization , la familia michoacana , or the michoacán family .
thank you .
the breaks got fewer and fewer .
nowadays , there are computational systems that can suss out emotional states and even lying from processing human faces .
well , we haven &apos;t done that , so we can &apos;t really expect to find an answer when we &apos;re still afraid of the question .
( applause ) the coolest thing about this — and this is what &apos;s completing the whole circle — is that in april of this year , at the geffen moca in downtown los angeles , there &apos;s going to be an exhibition called &quot; &quot; art of the streets . &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; art of the streets &quot; &quot; is going to have pretty much the bad-asses of the street art scene — banksy , shepard fairey , kaws — all of these guys will be there .
i &apos;m going to start with glenn gould .
so here are the graphs you &apos;ve seen lots of times before .
( laughter ) ( applause ) when we looked at the data , and we met with the staff , there were many excuses for why strawberry mansion was low-performing and persistently dangerous .
sort of eavesdrop on the activity of nerve cells in the brain .
this is a point cloud .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s nice about emotion .
the data came back from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and it was all the same : no correlation , no connection , none at all .

is there a place for me in the world out there ?
it was not going to work , so i decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had , at least some of them , had to also be moved through a hole that we could open up again in that wall and begin feeding the appropriate nonhuman animals through that hole onto the other side of being legal persons .
and an hour or two later , if i saw her , she &apos;d come over to me and she &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; bryan , do you still feel me hugging you ? &quot; &quot; and if i said , &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; she &apos;d assault me again , and if i said , &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; she &apos;d leave me alone .

but other countries in europe , notably the nordic countries , are showing that it &apos;s possible to have a kick-ass economy without being a workaholic .
it would mean that , even before birth , mothers are warning their children that it &apos;s a wild world out there , telling them , &quot; &quot; be careful . &quot; &quot; let me be clear .
i &apos;m half egyptian , and i &apos;m muslim .
there &apos;s still 13 trillion dollars circulating in the u.s. economy .
and i think , actually , that &apos;s already really happening .
let me show you this .
but also — and this is so important — to communicate their despair , to say , &quot; &quot; we &apos;ve tried this and it doesn &apos;t work , and what shall we do ? &quot; &quot; and then , lo and behold , there &apos;s another group answering these kids who may be in america , or maybe this is a group in israel , saying , &quot; &quot; yeah , you did it a little bit wrong . this is how you should do it . &quot; &quot; the philosophy is very simple .
here is not like anywhere else .
here it comes at you in real speed . you &apos;ll hear this .
and that creates a big problem .
we said , all right , let &apos;s , you know , throw so problems at holly , see if she messes these things up .
as we speak , there are 117 or so clinical trials researching the use of stem cells for liver diseases .
and also you can see the water is brown , the mud is brown and oil is brown , so when everything is mixed up , it &apos;s really hard to see what &apos;s in the water .
95 percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking , and that &apos;s because the precipitation patterns and the temperature patterns are changing .
in other words , you &apos;re certainly fast-forwarding this whole process of a billion people going to prosperity .
that makes me furious .
and i promise to you , this was such an important moment in my career , when i realized that the great leader believed in young people and new ideas .
measurement is the lifeblood of science and progress .
they undertook a study of autism prevalence in the general population .
yes , it &apos;s a little boring , but some people kind of get into the zen of it .
since 2001 , we &apos;ve interviewed hundreds of thousands of people — young and old , men and women , educated and illiterate .
so i decided to build a prototype .
and it &apos;s truly awesome and wondrous .
finished university education , got a medical degree , 1986 .
no magic . no secret . it &apos;s just love .
they &apos;re disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well .
and i faced a whole new set of challenges .
and further , he found a similar response in more or less the same location in 10 out of 12 subjects .
but , you know — is this actually dramatically changing love ?
a self-organizing system is one where a structure appears without explicit intervention from the outside .
they began as very local and specific .
he could not probably give the right kind of love for you , but for us , he has given the people the right kind of love , that is important .
tie game with five seconds left .
and mike , who i met at galapagos , a trip which i won at ted , is leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling his journey through cancer .
it &apos;s much more easy to build hybrids .
this is actually a disservice , because whales are ecosystem engineers .
( applause ) bruno giussani : yuval , you have a new book out .
in the sars epidemic , we learned in hong kong that most of transmission was because people were removing their masks improperly .
progress happens when all the factors that make for it are ready and then it is inevitable . &quot; &quot; 2007 . the iphone makes it debut .
it is displaying data that exists already in a different way , to amplify it , to provide cues to the doctors , to the nurses , so they can see what &apos;s happening .
and i think this is one level deeper , and it &apos;s actually a requirement for changing your perspective .
our goal , quite simply , is that every single judge in the united states will use a data-driven risk tool within the next five years .
&quot; okay , &quot; i thought , &quot; here &apos;s a first world country , let &apos;s see what they can do . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a speleologist , that means a cave explorer .
this is not james , this is one of the kids that he works with .
and in short order , the cooperators are done for .
thank you .
we &apos;ve tried various approaches , paring it down to minimal components .
it &apos;s a vast , impersonal , uncaring force of nature that is not affected by our wishes or desires .
so what if there were not only an internet of information , what if there were an internet of value — some kind of vast , global , distributed ledger running on millions of computers and available to everybody .
it &apos;s almost 80 million years old .
and the first of these is to connect , is that your social relationships are the most important cornerstones of your life .
now , if we take a step back and think about these other two really important advantages : one is improved immune responses through delivery , and the second is getting rid of the cold chain .
so i looked , and like the thousands of people that had tried before , i found nothing .
and to me , this is research misconduct .
but the key thing here is , what do you think should be in the new goals ?
alejandro aravena : i don &apos;t know if you were able to read the subtitles , but you can tell from the body language that participatory design is not a hippie , romantic , let &apos;s-all-dream-together-about- the-future-of-the-city kind of thing .
so i think in the next decade , the sciences and the humanities will come closer together to be able to answer deep questions about mankind .
be prepared to find vocations that make you useful to your neighbors and to your fellow citizens .
and that disparity struck me as this incredible intellectual and moral puzzle .
i &apos;m not here to make an indictment of democracy .
well the moon is casting a shadow down on the earth .
and — ( laughter ) they — they &apos;re invented around the same time . i think beer came first .
the chimps are playing better than the humans , better in the sense of adhering to game theory .
despite implicit and explicit questions of my right to be in an elite space , i &apos;m proud to report that when i graduated , i was the first black woman to earn a phd in astrophysics in yale &apos;s then 312-year history .
( laughter ) that &apos;s good , wake up , wake up , wake up .
in 2016 , it is the dimension of our being itself that cries out for its fair share of our imagination .
i &apos;m sick to death of this old cell phone .
they &apos;ve all defined the terms on which they will accept bookings .
what if there isn &apos;t enough clean air and fresh water ?
the doha tribeca film festival was held at our new cultural hub , katara .
how did hippomenes beat her ?
i made the front page of my hometown paper that i delivered for six years , you know ?
and then from hour to hour we rot and rot .
ms : and just like that , one by one , all of these companies suddenly disappeared .
it was my version of my grandfather &apos;s hours of the day alone in his library .
she organized a tedx action out there and made all the unseen faces of the city on the walls in her town .
the one thing we need to do is we have to replace these inefficient incandescent light bulbs , florescent lights , with this new technology of led , led light bulbs .
as you can see , one of our parties , you know , a few years ago .
so this past spring , as i was gearing up to begin writing a biography of muhammad , i realized i needed to read the koran properly — as properly as i could , that is .
it &apos;s more than that ; it &apos;s deeper .
here &apos;s what we do .
they explored the keyboard . they played around with it .
no knock on the neuroscientists .
now , put them on both cups .
this shapes how we think about our health , our relationships , how we decide how to vote , what we consider fair or ethical .
in 2005 , the egyptian stock exchange returned over 145 percent .
these electrodes act like mini pacemakers to get the cells to contract in the lab .
the men knew that the nearest islands they could reach were the marquesas islands , 1,200 miles away .
you &apos;re not from kenya .
and you even find a church .
by the way , dsl is a kludge .
and it really works to start with them .
and then they strike out across the ocean , down to kenya .
their behavior in terms of the underlying changes that are going on in their brain .
i drew it during the few hours of electricity we get .
many people in mexico are afraid today .
so the data has since been used by groups like human rights watch on its recent report on these types of sting operations .
there is a decent contribution to happiness from the genes — about 50 percent — but there is still that 50 percent that is unaccounted for .
the third thing is again cities .
how about we do this whole hill now ?
( laughter ) well , bob russell was telling us about his work on nanotubes in his research at the microscopic level .
the mission is not yet complete .
why is it that somebody might literally see the glass as half full , and somebody literally sees it as half empty ?
that &apos;s what the surgeon is saying in the operating room when the patient &apos;s on the table .
my opinion is that the mossad is involved , but that the leading force is not israel .
our hospitals have an explicit policy called age-based allocation of healthcare resources .
they are inaccessible to our senses but can be seen through mathematical lenses .
&quot; no , no , what you talking about ? &quot;
as she recounts : &quot; &quot; on the third day of creation , god commands the earth to grow a fruit-bearing fruit tree . &quot; &quot; for this first fruit tree , there was to be no differentiation between trunk , branches , leaves and fruit .
so how does it happen ?
and i think that &apos;s how we got to become human .
so , this talk is going to be about how do we make things and what are the new ways that we &apos;re going to make things in the future .
and what you &apos;re looking at is a paper form in the hand of a ministry of health nurse in indonesia , who is tramping out across the countryside in indonesia on , i &apos;m sure , a very hot and humid day , and she is going to be knocking on thousands of doors over a period of weeks or months , knocking on the doors and saying , &quot; &quot; excuse me , we &apos;d like to ask you some questions .
it &apos;s not a purely visual technology .
an important key insight that we learned about meetings is that people pack them in one after another , disruptive to the day .
it was like it was yesterday .
( laughter ) so , we &apos;re looking at the same criteria as most people — you know , can i afford it ?
and when the kindergarten kids recently moved their gate , they found out the fence was made out of tapioca .
and it &apos;s kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse , except that you &apos;re now running a string of these things down .
it was invented by russell smith , a passionate inventor in new zealand who was trying to help blind people .
and here we find that we can use these systems to test the application of this technology in particular tissues , for example , figuring out how to deliver the crispr tool into cells .
it was kind of along these lines , and the allegation was that i have , quote , &quot; &quot; affection for terrorists . &quot; &quot; now , the good news is that the person who said it was ann coulter .
they exist only to foster fear and promote transphobia .
we experimented on ourselves .
nothing that you would call architecture , right ?
this is how we landed for the most important meeting of the world &apos;s leaders in china .
and we have taken pictures like this .
it &apos;s like a rodeo show . they all get a ride on the machine , and they get rewarded for how fast or how far they can make the machine move forward .
they decided that wasn &apos;t good enough , so they went to india and studied the indian state of kerala that also had a system like this , and they adapted it for ethiopia .
and that &apos;s retirement homes on the west coast of florida .
it would have taken the three of them a very long time , especially given that none of them are actually from honolulu .
so i decided to contact you myself , for you to assure me of safety and honesty , if i have to entrust any amount of money under your custody .
he was 20-some years older than anybody else in the sample .
a metaphor will serve here : where elite mathematicians and statisticians and theorists often serve as architects in the expanding realm of science , the remaining large majority of basic applied scientists , including a large portion of those who could be said to be of the first rank , are the ones who map the terrain , they scout the frontiers , they cut the pathways , they raise the buildings along the way .
so we have this field of science that &apos;s all about slime , and color changes . check this out .
it &apos;s making a little bit fun of getting older , and , you know , people might like it .
late pick-ups went up every week for the next four weeks until they topped out at triple the pre-fine average , and then they fluctuated at between double and triple the pre-fine average for the life of the fine .
but kund , which uses the gypsum belt , for that you have to go back to your calendar , three million years ago .
i want to close with just two points .
we have more and more time-saving devices , but sometimes , it seems , less and less time .

this man , joel salatin , they call him a lunatic farmer because he grows against the system .
♫ and the sum of invisible power ♫ ♫ had a name . ♫ ♫ it &apos;s the same name . ♫ ♫ tembererana , hey , tembererana ... ♫ ♫ da , da , da , da , da , da , da ♫ ♫ tembere , tembere , tembere , tembererana ♫ ♫ tembere , tembere , tembere , tembererana , hey ♫ ♫ tembererana , hey ♫ ♫ tembererana ... ♫ ( applause )
and right beyond the historic bridge that you can see here , right next to the plaza , you can see that the river looked like a river of trash .
here &apos;s another group .
a professional psychic who speaks to dead people , she can &apos;t reach me ?
even when you &apos;re standing in front of a megaphone , it &apos;s pretty much every direction .
and we &apos;ve been getting a lot of takers . one is the rock &apos; n &apos; rollers .
we also have a classroom hives project , where — this is a nonprofit venture — we &apos;re spreading the word around the world for how honeybee hives can be taken into the classroom or into the museum setting , behind glass , and used as an educational tool .
in the united states , efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population .
and if you look at these figures for the more developed markets like u.k. , germany , and so on , they &apos;re actually much lower .
they were both only children who chose not to have kids .
that &apos;s 38 stories tall .
thanks very much .
this probably is : the aral sea .
when i made it to the halfway mark , at eight minutes , i was 100 percent certain that i was not going to be able to make this .
so i &apos;m going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas .
and those who do , on average , wait 11 months to make the report .
two weeks later , the police stopped them .
and gould &apos;s specialty was playing bach .
and that &apos;s why , next month in morocco , a meeting is taking place between all the countries .
is agriculture adapted to that ?
it doesn &apos;t make them good people , but it &apos;s at the heart of engineering , at the heart of a creative community , an innovative community , and the open source community , the basic ethos of it is , take what other people do , make it better , give it back so we all rise further .
but just because a system is sick doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s dying .
yet , no amount of diplomacy or institutional design can make up for local failures and the consequences that they have .
you can say a person is lying .
and why this is so important is that we now have grown a generation , maybe two , of kids where one out of every four meals is eaten in fast food , one of every four meals is eaten in a car and one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a tv or computer .
now , if you think about democracy from this perspective , a new pluralistic notion of democracy would be one that recognizes that there are many different interests , many different agendas , many different individuals , many different points of view .
and at my feet was the great , still blue plate of the pacific ocean .
the phones were there . but the expectation was once you moved in there your commitment was fully to the task at hand , fully to the people around you .
you do it again and again .
we don &apos;t have to like each other — and sometimes we really don &apos;t like each other .
kids made hamburger cards that were made out of construction paper .
that &apos;s another contradiction — science and art don &apos;t often go together , but interweaving them can help these girls bring their whole selves to what they learn , and maybe one day join the ranks of astronomers who are full of contradictions , and use their backgrounds to discover , once and for all , that we are truly not alone in the universe .
a maybe that could take the form of a gas or a liquid .
it &apos;s actually pretty busy .
so instead of going to coffee meetings or fluorescent-lit conference room meetings , i ask people to go on a walking meeting , to the tune of 20 to 30 miles a week .
what &apos;s going to happen over time with that ?
( laughter ) that &apos;s why the mascot of internet engineering , if it had one , is said to be the bumblebee .
and following that basic idea of the village , we changed it as we got into it .
pucker up big and lean in just a little bit , okay ?
now , if the dna sequences match , they &apos;ll stick together , and so we can look at spots .
so we &apos;ve teamed up with the decoder of the human genome , craig venter , and the company he founded with peter diamandis , the founder of the x prize , to genetically modify the pig genome so that the pig &apos;s organs will not be rejected by the human body and thereby to create an unlimited supply of transplantable organs .
that &apos;s pretty clearly not a good thing .
w1 : they suck .
so there is a lot of emotional communication that happens there .
but a few made it anyway , despite our best efforts , and now it &apos;s time for us to thank them for the work they did and give them every chance they have to raise the coral reefs of the future , their coral babies .
and , even more importantly , since this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture , we can shoot emily in just part of an afternoon , in many different facial poses and facial expressions .
one is that you and i all have between 30 to 50,000 chemicals in our bodies that our grandparents didn &apos;t have .
there are many questions i could not understand , and there are some questions i did not want to understand .
sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise , once clockwise and peck the key twice .
we have the human systems of how we communicate and interrelate and have our whole constructed society , we have the industrial systems , which is essentially the entire economy , and then all of that has to operate within the biggest system , and , i would argue , the most important , the ecosystem .
i wrote him back and said ...
we had a president , moi , who was a dictator .
i &apos;ve pirated the term system d from the former french colonies .
you see , there &apos;s a lot of things we just don &apos;t have data on .
and so i realized it was o.k. to go .
these are the kind of , you know , scenes that you remember and expect from &quot; &quot; jaws . &quot; &quot; and she &apos;s being eaten ; there &apos;s a shark .
and i &apos;d been to russia several times under the communists , and they &apos;d given me marvelous freedom that i didn &apos;t expect .
and that &apos;s a terrifying factor — when you start something and it turns that way — because it means that all that &apos;s left for you is to go back and to find out what the next thing is that you can push , that you can invent , that you can be ignorant about , that you can be arrogant about , that you can fail with , and that you can be a fool with .
so far we &apos;re taking the one , or up to five kilograms of output .
it &apos;s about how our brain is tricked into seeing a persistence of vision that creates a motion picture , and one of the things i had to do is , we — sasha baron cohen is a very clever , very smart guy , comedian , wanted to basically do an homage to the kind of the buster keaton sort of slapstick things , and he wanted his leg brace to get caught on a moving train .
okay , so you can see here the spot .
look at the industry for self-image and the jobs it creates , the revenue it turns over .
when we put people under a lamp for the equivalent of about 30 minutes of sunshine in summer in edinburgh , what we produced was , we produced a rise in circulating nitric oxide .
and so they needed to be able to quickly transform between different theater organizations , and for operational budget reasons , this actually no longer happens in pretty much any multi-form theater in the united states , so we needed to figure out a way to overcome that .
let &apos;s take a closer look in the united states .
you know what i &apos;m saying , just stand up there and answer some random questions ?
they came to detroit for a better way of life .
we used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts .
and they also , of course , had to get people to accept these so-called assets and pay money for them even though they were highly vulnerable .
your intuition might tell you that too .
and you &apos;re seeing a lot of things passing through its minds , a lot of self-models that try to explain the relationship between actuation and sensing . it then tries to do a second action that creates the most disagreement among predictions of these alternative models , like a scientist in a lab . then it does that and tries to explain that , and prune out its self-models .
we know that on mars and the moon there are tons of these structures .
to the trained eye , you can look at the roofs of these malocas , these longhouses , and see that there &apos;s cultural diversity .
she goes away with stars in her eyes about india , as a result .
we do exactly nothing to them until they &apos;re already two years old .
thank you .
so , what people were saying to me about the cause of cancer , sources of cancer , or , for that matter , why you are who you are , didn &apos;t make sense .
the final thing is , again just to reiterate that there &apos;s this practical part , and so we &apos;ve made these anti-quorum sensing molecules that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics .
so just because paper was invented before computers , it doesn &apos;t necessarily mean you get more to the basics of the subject by using paper instead of a computer to teach mathematics .
and when the great big parachute opened , we knew that if it didn &apos;t open there &apos;s a second parachute , and it runs on a nice little clockwork mechanism .
and the truth be told , this is it , isn &apos;t it ?
imagine somewhere in the world : mumbai , beijing , new york , london .
when i moved to harare in 1985 , social justice was at the core of zimbabwe &apos;s national health policy .
when researchers ask heroin addicts what &apos;s the toughest drug to quit , most say cigarettes .
we can &apos;t . what &apos;s great about the agile system is you build in a system of change so that you can react to what &apos;s happening to you in real time .
na : on twitter also .
very few people want to talk about death , and even fewer about children &apos;s death .
so what happens when a person gets a retinal degenerative disease like macular degeneration ? what happens is is that , the front-end cells die , the photoreceptors die , and over time , all the cells and the circuits that are connected to them , they die too .
so this is going to be a crash where they &apos;re going to slam this thing forward into a wall at 30 miles an hour , and see what happens . ok ?
so , climate change is not a new thing .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
the blood veins in our hands echoed a course of water traces on the earth .
we tend to think of business strategy as being a rather abstract body of essentially economic thought , perhaps rather timeless .
i was able to do more things .
and these older people come up to me now and they say , &quot; &quot; mr. stevenson , you give talks , you make speeches , you tell people to stop saying we &apos;re dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation &apos;s history after 9 / 11 . &quot; &quot; they tell me to say , &quot; &quot; no , tell them that we grew up with that . &quot; &quot; and that era of terrorism , of course , was followed by segregation and decades of racial subordination and apartheid .
and the thing that the ordinary afghan is most concerned with is — clare lockhart is here , so i &apos;ll recite a discussion she had with an illiterate woman in northern afghanistan .
as a scientist , i &apos;ve been a crew commander for a nasa mars simulation last year , and as an artist , i create multicultural community art all over the planet .
former guests from around the world had seen that the riots were happening just down the street , and wanted to check if he needed anything .
and suddenly everything looked different .
and fence line was amazing in itself .
but the distances on the universe are so large and the time scales are so large that it takes a long time for this to form .
and for handicapped , they can use this as a normal system .
( laughter ) you were born in new haven , connecticut .
here &apos;s how i think about it : sexting is like leaving your wallet at your boyfriend &apos;s house .
the economies of the future depend on that .
i just joined the points .
when i talk to people who didn &apos;t know me before the shootings , i have three challenges to meet .
so there &apos;s a pretty big gap there .
but in order for you to not just understand how this system works , but to also get personally connected to it , i decided to break the story down into several different narratives .
and the first automation wave in the 1970s .
we can &apos;t do that anymore .
for the first time , you &apos;ll have actors that really feel very interactive , that have real bodies that really react .
if the wind blows them over , they &apos;re like beetles stuck there on the ground .
and every citizen should be able to download an app that shows the population of drones and autonomous vehicles moving through public spaces around them , both right now and historically .
it &apos;s cold , it &apos;s eerie , it &apos;s misty , it might be raining , and you might be standing on the shores of lake michigan brimming with paint thinner . ( laughter ) that is the view that we had of the surface of titan before we got there with cassini , and i can tell you that what we have found on titan , though it is not the same in detail , is every bit as fascinating as that story is .
watch the animal .
the next day , the market started to change regime , course .
they have taught me a lot , and i &apos;d like to be able to share some of these observations with you .
to play a game in those days you had to have an imagination to believe that you were really playing &quot; &quot; battlestar galactica . &quot; &quot; the graphics were just horrible .
unknown in the west , this was the collected wisdom of an entire continent , the voice of africa at a time when africa was thought not to have a voice at all .
but what are we going to do about the monkeys and loss aversion ?
ma : well the interesting part was i was asked what it was like to be the first woman secretary of state a few minutes after i &apos;d been named .
it &apos;s a fact .
♫ we will be long gone by then ♫ ♫ in lackluster ♫ ♫ in dust we lay around old magazines ♫ ♫ fluorescent lighting sets the scene ♫ ♫ for all we could and should be being ♫ ♫ in the one life that we &apos;ve got ♫ ♫ everybody says ♫ ♫ time heals everything ♫ ♫ and what of the wretched hollow ? ♫ ♫ the endless in between ? ♫ ♫ are we just going to wait it out ? ♫ ♫ just going to sweat it out ? ♫ ♫ just going to sweat it out ? ♫ ♫ wait it out ♫
this is their lobby .
in fact , this whole area is like a yellowstone national park with all of the trimmings .
( applause ) dinosaurs are kind of funny , you know .
( applause ) and it &apos;s counterintuitive , but the cost of energy expended for the flight is only two cents of a dollar today , and we &apos;re just at the beginning of this .
alexander rose came up with this idea of a spiraloid tower with continuous sloping ramps .
i &apos;ve always been attracted to those rare people who pull that off , who devote their lives to humanity with the grit of the warrior and the grace of the mystic — people like martin luther king , jr . , who wrote , &quot; &quot; i can never be what i ought to be until you are what you ought to be .
so even more important than buildings in a city are the public spaces in between them .
what you &apos;re watching is a design of a robotic red blood cell , and it does bring up the issue that our biology is actually very sub-optimal , even though it &apos;s remarkable in its intricacy .
we did sort of a simulation , because you had video discs , and again , this is &apos; 76 .
now there are many ways you can get infected .
kevin shangraw : the iraqi people are who we are there to help — and we just killed one .
so you have to be prepared .
now , i &apos;m from new york , so it &apos;s 100 percent satisfaction here .
it was three feet off the ground , and they said , &quot; &quot; what is this ? &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; yeah , it &apos;s , i don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) they said , &quot; &quot; why have you put it there ? &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; just like that . &quot; &quot; and they said , &quot; &quot; can we touch it ? &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; if you wish to . &quot; &quot; and i went away .
to do this though , we need to redesign education in a major way , to balance depth with interdisciplinary communication , and explicitly train people how to contribute to , and benefit from other disciplines .
and what you see , at the lower right-hand side there , is a sample in which a single sample of blood has been put on the top , and it has gone through and distributed itself into these 16 holes on the bottom , in a piece of paper — basically it looks like a chip , two pieces of paper thick .
so , i will . here &apos;s the vision for ted .
bipolar disorder is nicknamed the ceo disease .
now , for us environmentalists , maybe the greenest thing about the cities is they diffuse the population bomb .
and so even if we make those very important decisions for very silly reasons , it remains statistically true that there are more georges living in georgia and there are more dennises becoming dentists and there are more paulas who are married to paul than statistically viable .
i play the part of a magician , a wizard , if you will , a real wizard .
so obviously , we have a q &amp; a portion of our program , and people line up to mics to ask questions .
this ice formed as snow 15,800 years ago , when our ancestors were daubing themselves with paint and considering the radical new technology of the alphabet .
i have this job interview in galena in 15 minutes , and i need this job , i &apos;ve got to go . &quot; &quot; again he asked me , &quot; &quot; what do you think we should do ? &quot; &quot; i &apos;m in high school . i have no idea .

but if you &apos;re a geek like me , you say , &quot; &quot; well , what do the data say ? &quot; &quot; and you start to do things like graph things that we might be interested in — the total worldwide population , for example , or some measure of social development or the state of advancement of a society .
especially when chimpanzees , and other animals with large brains , are studied in captivity , modern technology is helping us to search for the upper levels of cognition in some of these non-human animals .
people used to say when they &apos;d come fund us , &quot; geoff , why do you provide these health services ? &quot;

apollo 11 . are you kidding me ?
the typical answer to the question — we had to design 1,040 apartments — would have looked like this : 24-story height limit given by the planning authorities , 12 towers with nothing but residual in between — a very tight system that , although the tower isolates you , it doesn &apos;t even give you privacy , because you &apos;re so close to the next one , that it is very questionable what the qualities of this would be .
so for every digital renegade that is revolting in the streets of tehran , there may as well be two digital captives who are actually rebelling only in the world of warcraft .

they &apos;re just not big enough .
and these guys are , like , serial offenders , and i &apos;m pretty sure everyone in this room has a refrigerator .
i &apos;m talking about , how do we secure the space , the demos , the platform of values , so that we can tap into all of your potential ?

sorry , when people say &quot; &quot; i can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; they &apos;re usually talking about their own lack of imagination , and not about the unlikelihood of the event that they &apos;re describing .

i &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
and the pipa trust board holds that license and pays the country for this .
on the vertical axis , you &apos;ll see the distribution of children &apos;s choices in each condition , and you &apos;ll see that the distribution of the choices children make depends on the evidence they observe .
but when you &apos;re down here , where the psycho milts of the world are adding one photo at a time , that &apos;s institution as obstacle .

in that same slum in nairobi , i met a young businesswoman , and she was making backpacks out of her home .
we &apos;re just trying to connect the two .

he &apos;s illiterate , and he communicates with voice messages .
and the school cow is trying to figure out how to replace the lawnmower on the playing field .
your blood tries to boil . it &apos;s called vaporization .

that means every bad loan goes bad 47 times over .
they both have rhinoviruses ; we &apos;ve never seen this pattern in lab .
and the result has been just the same as in william muir &apos;s experiment : aggression , dysfunction and waste .
now i trained in medicine in india , and after that i chose psychiatry as my specialty , much to the dismay of my mother and all my family members who kind of thought neurosurgery would be a more respectable option for their brilliant son .
and i &apos;ll just never forget when i started working on exoplanet atmospheres 20 years ago , how many people told me , &quot; &quot; this will never happen .
unfortunately , just across the road from it or quite close by is the column of marcus aurelius , and the diameter of the dirigible makes an impression , as you can see , as she starts trying to read the story that spirals around the column of marcus aurelius — gets a little too close , nudges it .

and in this tunnel , we use superconducting magnets colder than outer space to accelerate protons to almost the speed of light and slam them into each other millions of times per second , collecting the debris of these collisions to search for new , undiscovered fundamental particles .
so people continue to flee into neighboring countries , and we build refugee camps for them in the desert .
because for me , it feels like a fertile , creative medium .
that &apos;s two days ago .

i was quite impressed by this feat , at how what was essentially just a bag of cellular slime could somehow map its territory , know itself , and move with seeming intention .
i asked her why her side makes such outrageous allegations and lies about my side .

we came up with a fantasy scenario of a dj traveling around the states , that would collect records and go on tours .
but today , after 60 years , because of the rise of entrepreneurship , entrepreneurs have become role models , and they are contributing hugely to the society .
that holds the long strand like this .
what &apos;s the goal ?

i &apos;ve already told the people that we have tropical rain this time of year .

in sangin where i was sick in 2002 , the nearest health clinic was within three days walk .

i could try , but i can &apos;t .
it &apos;s a very violent process that is little known .
and detroit will make money on every unit .
so the stuff i &apos;m talking about is the peculiar problem of modern , affluent , western societies .
rendering authenticity — and the keyword is &quot; &quot; rendering . &quot; &quot; right ? rendering , because you have to get your consumers — as business people — to percieve your offerings as authentic .
and i was mentioning abed and myself , noting deliberately that i was here in peace , to the people in this town , when i met mohamed outside a post office at noon .
they introduced me to the new york city strategic alliance for health , again , free resources , don &apos;t waste them .
well , see , now i &apos;m thinking , i &apos;m in manhattan , this is a bad analogy , but most americans who don &apos;t live in manhattan get up in the morning and get in their cars and turn on that ignition , and their cars work , and they work incredibly well .
and my cousin , of course , the actor kevin bacon — ( laughter ) — who is my first cousin &apos;s twice removed &apos;s wife &apos;s niece &apos;s husband &apos;s first cousin once removed &apos;s niece &apos;s husband .
( applause ) but if you look at what we &apos;ve done , if you have the courage to really look at it , you &apos;ll see that not only do our kids think their worth comes from grades and scores , but that when we live right up inside their precious developing minds all the time , like our very own version of the movie &quot; &quot; being john malkovich , &quot; &quot; we send our children the message : &quot; hey kid , i don &apos;t think you can actually achieve any of this without me . &quot;
put them all together , and put all this under kind of natural selection , under mutation , and rewarded things for how well they can move forward .
as the novelty wore off , the months went by , there was some amount of tolerance , people got used to it .
so data is of course a massively useful tool to make better decisions , but i believe that things go wrong when data is starting to drive those decisions .
so when , as adults , we role-play , then we have a huge set of these scripts already internalized .
as a software developer and technologist , i &apos;ve worked on a number of civic technology projects over the years .
in a 2011 report from the institute for women &apos;s policy research , the gender wage gap between men and women was 23 percent .
for women without dense breasts , mammography is the best choice .

so it turned into a dual celebration , because natasha was the first person from this village ever to go to the united states .
his name is brian eno .
&quot; you get her . &quot; &quot; no , no , you take her . &quot;
i just want to represent them in a beautiful light .
but certainly , it &apos;s going to be going to the unknown america .
this is a pharmaceutical ad .
you &apos;ve probably all read about it or heard about in some incarnation . let me give you a two-sentence version of it .
it wasn &apos;t about the end result .
also there is a lot of data that still needs to be collected .
now this is doubly ironic when you consider that what gives comedy its edge at reaching around people &apos;s walls is the way that it uses deliberate misdirection .
i &apos;ve spent 59 days on the back of a camel from chad to timbuktu .
i &apos;ll never forget the sound of laughing with my friends . i &apos;ll never forget the sound
but i needed the support of the village , and here again , when the men heard , and the people heard that a woman had gotten an opportunity to go to school , they said , &quot; &quot; what a lost opportunity .
i &apos;ve learned about the poetry and the wisdom and the grace that can be found in the words of people all around us when we simply take the time to listen , like this interview between a betting clerk in brooklyn named danny perasa who brought his wife annie to storycorps to talk about his love for her .
it turns out , almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photoreceptors , and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication .
and so i said , &quot; &quot; did you just move into this office ? &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; no , we &apos;ve been here about a year . &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; are you telling me that i am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year ? &quot; &quot; and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; yeah . or maybe you &apos;re the only one who had to go to the bathroom . &quot;
but in order for me to explain what that is , i need to spend just a couple of minutes talking more about cancer itself .
but i have to tell you — everybody always asks , &quot; &quot; what happened to the baby baboon ? &quot; &quot; it did die , and we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights .
that &apos;s because the ideology , the governing ideology of apple is the ideology of the perfectionist product designer in cupertino .
she would not stop trying to feed me penguins .
and i didn &apos;t like that war , i thought it was stupid .

they were sent out on the most dangerous missions and they sustained the highest combat casualty rate of any unit proportionally .
we got past the janitor .
and after even 30 years of doing this , after 30 years of exploring the ocean , i never cease to be amazed at the extraordinary encounters that i have while i &apos;m at sea .
it &apos;s the &quot; &quot; what &quot; &quot; detector .
and this is the first device that we did , and i &apos;m going to talk about my second wish , which has something to do with this .
when powerful people misused their privilege , we were going to get them .
first is the simple power of good visualization tools to help untangle complexity and just encourage you to ask questions you didn &apos;t think of before .
i wanted to think about what else i could put shadows on , and i thought of my friend bernie .
this was how computing began .
what if the cure for cancer or the answer the global warming lies in the head of a young female scientist who fails to progress ?
we told a security guard that she was missing , though she wasn &apos;t missing .
so i look up and i &apos;m thinking , maybe he &apos;s still going to think i &apos;m kind of cute . &quot; &quot; &quot; ma , are you still doing that ? &quot;
i can &apos;t get my father in italy to work on the internet .
so this problem is absolutely soluble .
what i take away , and this in some ways is the most important , he espoused and exhibited a reverence for dignity that was really , really unusual .
scientists , sort of at the end of the 20th century , learned that they could track blood flow to map non-invasively where activity was going on in the human brain .
because it &apos;s so cold , the entire contents of that hut is still as they left it , with the remnants of the last meal they cooked still there .
one has asperger syndrome . one has adhd .
that night she asked me , &quot; how come you are not joining the beauty pageant ? &quot;
it doesn &apos;t matter how hard i train , i &apos;m never actually going to get there .
that is going to be the price .
and there is a sound chamber .
this shows you a patent landscape .
these are choices that your grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are going to have before them .
so , part of this story , i think — well , it &apos;s a terrifying story , it &apos;s a very dark story and it &apos;s a story that continues on in many of the developing cities of the world .
anyway , i went home that night . i thought about it .
and they ended up naming the company warby parker .
so to just end up , there are things of suffering in the one billion poorest , which we don &apos;t know .
it had recently gone public and the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars , a number i didn &apos;t really understand .
the interesting thing is that intuitive eaters are less likely to be overweight , and they spend less time thinking about food .
and what we learned was that we needed to think about redesigning courses .
that &apos;s also an insult to history .
to get from age zero to three was hard .
there &apos;s no question he &apos;s hitting above his weight .
tm : my mother &apos;s biggest concern when i transitioned was who was going to love me as i am .
and chris is a fisherman farmer . both are generalists .
this is one of the first results that came out of our study a little over a year ago that really surprised us .
now , this is dr. lene harbott applying electrodes to the head of john morton .
and i looked at word analysis .
all this would do is wreck a family .
( laughter ) ca : i guess , i don &apos;t think there is like a one-minute other piece you guys can do ?
for centuries , they &apos;ve been used to look at things like bacteria .
and they all treat learning , not as some sort of academic , analytical activity , but as that &apos;s something that &apos;s productive , something you make , something that you can do , perhaps earn a living from .
and the next six months of my life were the hardest time in my career , trying to design , build and deploy out in the field these 25 time-lapse cameras .
so these are all 3,214 pictures taken up there .
i &apos;m talking about dying .
a seemingly endless evolution of self and a community , but also this really deep desire not to leave anyone behind .
it &apos;s safe to say that we reimagined some traditions , but we also kept some old ones that we worked in , and we created something that worked for us .
and people magazine , i thought , got probably the best shot .
the data says it all the time .
i &apos;ll give you an example here .
but what are states and nations ?
( laughter ) rb : it &apos;s a tough job , isn &apos;t it ?
this caused major riots in my city .
two big storms and this notion of &quot; &quot; walk the walk &quot; &quot; prompted creation of elam back in 1998 .
( laughter ) and i had a choice in that moment , as all grenade throwers do .
who here has had surgery ?
if they &apos;re not working , put a shelf on it , which i did , and that shows all the customers my products .
and actually , private companies help governments with taxes .
it &apos;s not good .
nonetheless , when you hear real laughter and when you hear posed laughter , the brains are responding completely differently , significantly differently .
he had a lesser charge of forgery , got a year sentence and died a hero to the dutch people .
and this is actually a real photograph of earth taken by the voyager 1 spacecraft , four billion miles away .
ultimately , that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . &quot; &quot; why don &apos;t we all team up ? why don &apos;t we bring truce to life ?
why hasn &apos;t this happened sooner , and what can we do with it next ?
so was martin luther king , jr . so was dorothy day .
then it changes again .
everybody agrees with it .
and some of them were available . so , we hired one .
there is growing demand , growing population .
( laughter ) now , sylvia browne is an exception , an exception in one way , because the james randi educational foundation , my foundation , offers a one million dollar prize in negotiable bonds .
so here we are using 20 million barrels a day — producing eight , importing 12 , and from the 12 , five comes from opec .
if you ask people about what part of psychology do they think is hard , and you say , &quot; &quot; well , what about thinking and emotions ? &quot; &quot; most people will say , &quot; &quot; emotions are terribly hard .
it &apos;s all hidden in this code , and it &apos;s starting to be understood at breakneck pace .
this energy that is in your arm will not be in your legs .
in these seconds , your eyes are watching , left and right , left and right , and your brain wants those pictures to be identical .
and it &apos;s known for prostitution , violence , drugs : a hard place to grow up .
the head says there &apos;s a way forward .
we streamed data from the bedside instruments in their pediatric intensive care so that we could both look at the data in real time and , more importantly , to store the data so that we could start to learn from it .
and she created a dance piece which then prime minister nehru saw .
there &apos;s an effect on you and on your leaders .
this song is called &quot; &quot; the alphabet ...
integrative design can also increase energy savings in industry .
not infinite concentration of wealth , but the higher the gap between r and g , the higher the level of inequality of wealth towards which society tends to converge .
they would take the picture and then i would secret out from behind my robe a chocolate gold coin .
it &apos;s an actual thing .
this girl was raped repeatedly , forcefully penetrated with a blunt rod , beaten , bitten , and left to die .
that kind of makes sense to us .
don &apos;t do that .
so this is just one experiment that we published a few years ago , where a monkey , without moving its body , learned to control the movements of an avatar arm , a virtual arm that doesn &apos;t exist .
i just found this . what do you think we should do with it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t know , put it in the lost and found . &quot;
bone .
i &apos;m also interested in working with unusual materials and common materials in unusual ways .
creativity : it took creativity to solve the problem of getting all the thumbs into the node .
design thinkers believe that everyone is creative .
the same spot , it was a crime spot where people were being robbed .
it really goes beyond distinction .
if you want to know about africa , read our literature — and not just &quot; &quot; things fall apart , &quot; &quot; because that would be like saying , &quot; i &apos;ve read &apos; gone with the wind &apos; and so i know everything about america . &quot;
could you regenerate a limb ?
thank you .
and this blew his mind . literally . he checked into a sanitarium . ( laughter ) and when he came out of the sanitarium , he was convinced that he had been put on earth to found transfinite set theory because the largest set of infinity would be god himself .
and then , by using it in a targeted approach we &apos;re going to try to differentiate the machinery to recover function in old age .
so if you take the average commute time in america , which is about 50 minutes , you multiply that by the 120 million workers we have , that turns out to be about six billion minutes wasted in commuting every day .
have you heard of the idea of the mozart effect ?
was more than i could have hoped for .
but for the past eight years , i &apos;ve done something completely different .
and this is the kind of call that is used by , say , right whale mothers and calves as they separate to come back again .
so we took too many of them .
this is the nomadic dream , a different kind of american dream lived by young hobos , travelers , hitchhikers , vagrants and tramps .
i think black guys generally know where they &apos;re going .
i knew i would find her someday , or we would find each other .
she was born with very badly deformed back legs and pelvis .
it &apos;s the only threat , the only influence that the reef had to deal with .
first , no real sports fan would talk that way .
but you hit &quot; &quot; submit order . &quot; &quot; and two days later , this package shows up on your doorstep .
umar is seven years old , and he &apos;s from northern nigeria .
what &apos;s hard in our decision-making is when these two rules conflict .
maybe something like this .
that &apos;s what i thought — and i was shocked when i saw a picture of it .
no longer does aids need to kill two million a year .
there was a time when i considered wild soundscapes to be a worthless artifact .
if we think about drug treatment today , all the major breakthroughs — for hiv , for tuberculosis , for depression , for diabetes — it &apos;s always a cocktail of drugs .
so we have , in skin pigmentation , one of these wonderful products of evolution that still has consequences for us today .
what are some other metamorphoses that you &apos;ve had ?
( laughter ) okay , now that sounds a little flip , but make no mistake , the stakes are very high .
but , in fact , the print date was the early 1980s , when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me .
bg : thank you very much .
so i went to sleep , and that was it for me .
so we really can make changes .
and some states have differential policies , county by county .
so what about the poorest two billion ?
but then in the end , what i decided was every time you finish writing the word , i would stop and i would give the card to somebody on the side of the road .
so for now , let &apos;s turn to the evidence for dark matter .
this is perhaps the best picture i have .
i am sure , i am optimistic , that they will make cities better than our most ambitious dreams .
we think the world really looks like our buildings .
if you were not able to take the scoreboard out of the arena and be able to do the ice capades the next night , that would also be bad .
great , right ?
he grew up in a bohio of dirt floors , and the structure was the kind used by the tainos , our old arawak ancestors .
we are a bottom-heavy culture in more ways than one .
but hopefully , it was said with enough conviction that it was at least alluringly mysterious .
but maybe me , i give out something better because i give them hope . &quot; &quot; and in the middle of this economic crisis , where so many of us are inclined to pull in with fear , i think we &apos;re well suited to take a cue from jane and reach out , recognizing that being poor doesn &apos;t mean being ordinary .
that &apos;s not going to be happening , but you can see that the line comes down faster if they &apos;re not put under international pressure , if they &apos;re allowed to pursue their own devices .
that can &apos;t be energetically sensible .
philosophers have told us for thousands of years that the power to create is very closely linked to the power to destroy .
roman mars : according to the north american vexillological association .
the indians don &apos;t even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in india fill two or three gallons every time .
have you ever had a nagging feeling that one day you will be discovered as a fraud ?
i know the response to this .
we &apos;re not the first ones to build houses for our young .
but in this case it happened in real life .
mind your language .
the armillaria is actually a predatory fungus , killing certain species of trees in the forest .
and i tend to be a person who thinks too much and talks too little .
16 percent ! meaning that there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle , but only .16 percent of actual metastases — suggesting that maybe skeletal muscle is able to control the angiogenesis , is able to control the tumors recruiting these blood vessels .
but in fact , what they said was , &quot; &quot; leave doug and come down yourself .
it &apos;s the second world war .
the legends that you see in the movie don &apos;t appear for the monkey .
and this is an approach that &apos;s used all over the world , including in our lab .
( laughter ) okay . we are actually the first species on earth to be so prolific to actually threaten our own survival .
among the many memorable episodes of that retreat ... ( laughter )
so , we wondered : can we do anything useful with this capacity to control metabolic flexibility ?
on the path that american children travel to adulthood , two institutions oversee the journey .
so here &apos;s two sort of canonical neurons from a vertebrate and an invertebrate , a human pyramidal neuron from ramon y cajal , and another cell to the right , a non-spiking interneuron , and this is the work of alan watson and malcolm burrows many years ago , and malcolm burrows came up with a pretty interesting idea based on the fact that this neuron from a locust does not fire action potentials .
there &apos;s another one that throws plates and breaks them .
the u.s. attorney general recently released a report stating that they &apos;re going to ban solitary confinement in new york state for teens .
now , bluefin were revered by man for all of human history .
observe the upper-left one .
artificial intelligence used to be about putting commands in a box .
dh : right now ?
i had an awareness of being in my body , but also being out of my body , somewhere else , watching from above as if it was happening to someone else .
and i think this just shows how we were approaching the problem of incredibly large-scale construction .
and if you now try to cram 100,000 chimpanzees into oxford street , or into wembley stadium , or tienanmen square or the vatican , you will get chaos , complete chaos .
she is confined under the four walls of her home .
a committee of 12-year-old children would find out in 20 minutes that the most efficient way to use scarce road space is with exclusive lanes for buses .
it &apos;s not that hard a problem .
i think that &apos;s pretty exciting : tune-in literary fiction .
and the good thing about them is that they are deciding which houses go next .
we are graduating members from the class of we made it , not the faded echoes of voices crying out , &quot; names will never hurt me . &quot;
you and i can experience things without a story .
in that nine months , i went around the country and i talked to hundreds of people that were locked up , and i talked to many businesses that were also operating in afghanistan .
what we &apos;re done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wikipedia page and we reduced it down to a little summary .
the other things they &apos;ve worked on — i didn &apos;t have time to say this in my talk — is they &apos;ve restored functional hearing to thousands of deaf people .
the great success story of india , a country that so many learned scholars and journalists assumed would disintegrate , in the &apos; 50s and &apos; 60s , is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus .
we , after it &apos;s fermented and it &apos;s developed , started to develop flavor and character , we divide it into smaller units .
now i know there are people out there who will say that the election of barack obama meant that it was the end of racial discrimination for all eternity , right ?
this was one of the great things about my year , doing the sabbath , because i am a workaholic , so having this one day where you cannot work , it really , that changed my life .
we can &apos;t keep taking without expecting serious consequences as a result .
and this is maybe what explains why , for 30 years , he continued to make false papers at the expense of all kinds of sacrifices .
and here &apos;s the trick .
if australia disappears tomorrow , terror is probably the right response .
the biggest asset , in my opinion , one of the biggest assets in bertie county right now is this man : this is dr. chip zullinger , fondly known as dr. z.
or your memory sticks that you have now can carry one gigabyte of stuff on them — before , it was 256 .
it &apos;s all the things a phone should be .
i &apos;m going to be talking about designing humor , which is sort of an interesting thing , but it goes to some of the discussions about constraints , and how in certain contexts , humor is right , and in other contexts it &apos;s wrong .
especially when good things happen , and , in particular , when bad things happen .
this is where people make decisions , where they develop willpower .
in 1987 i heard of a story about a boy that fell through ice and was trapped under a river .
mohamed nanabhay who &apos;s sitting with us , the head of aljazeera.net , he told me that a 2,500 percent increase of accessing our website from various parts of the world .
no life without tectonic activity , without volcanic activity .
( audio : &quot; &quot; mary had a little lamb &quot; &quot; ) and so , again , that sounds distorted , but what &apos;s really amazing here is that we were able to do this with something that you could literally run out and pick up at a best buy .
you know , it &apos;s the empathy and the compassion that comes out of having relationships with people who are different from you .
we &apos;re already starting to see early retirement occur this year .
and , for example , this — if we go back here — this has become surprisingly popular among composers finding musical forms by searching the computational universe .
you probably think of fbi agents gunning down bad guys like john dillinger , or arresting corrupt politicians .
in one famous example from decades ago , the management of vanity fair magazine actually circulated a memo entitled : &quot; forbidding discussion among employees of salary received . &quot;
and this is where i think we can take a leaf out of systems theory , systems engineers , where they create feedback loops , put the right information at the right point of time .
here &apos;s another example of how comparing to the past can befuddle our decisions .
finally , self-organizing systems , about which , again , i won &apos;t say too much because you &apos;ve been hearing all about it .
a victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement &apos;s use of images .
i should add that it &apos;s very simple to add things like hair , clothes , etc . , but what we &apos;ve done here is use a very simple visualization , so you can concentrate on the movement .
so they &apos;re crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second , and as they do so , they not only curve space , but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space , an actual wave on space-time .
what does it look like ?
but one day , something happened .
anybody know what this is ? it ’ s the peyote cactus .
yet it &apos;s one that &apos;s rarely asked .
cheeto paint is a very simple way to paint with cheetos .
this is the craft that was going on , but there are a few collectors who also collect art which can depreciate .
( laughter ) so we have the watches and the language , and you &apos;re detecting a theme here , right ?
but it &apos;s important to note that all of this retrofitting is not occurring — just bulldozers are coming and just plowing down the whole city .
why don &apos;t you let your family stay home , because you do know that you get a 30-day leave .
so on that frame , the children who are typical are watching this , the emotion of expression of that little boy as he &apos;s fighting a little bit with the little girl .
so when do you play baseball ?
what evidence is there for this ?
it &apos;s that acrid , tar-like flavor .
and then , only a week and a half ago , we flew over the north pole of titan and found , again , we found a feature here the size of the caspian sea .
( applause ) so we &apos;re building these buildings .
it &apos;s so much more subtle , so much more visceral — you know , what &apos;s visible , what &apos;s not .
so i just switched on in the train , loudly .
i know this . i &apos;ve spent most of my career researching these programs .
and how could a digital identity of a company be embodied in a building ?
but we ’ re nowhere near the endgame when it comes to our perception .
you don &apos;t understand laughter fully by the time your brain has matured at the end of your teens .
a commitment device is a decision that you make with a cool head to bind yourself so that you don &apos;t do something regrettable when you have a hot head .
they &apos;re open because they ask the audience to be a player , a protagonist , a partner , rather than a passive spectator , and they &apos;re open because they know that imagination cannot be contained in buildings , and so much of the work they do is site-specific or outdoor work .
well , that doesn &apos;t really cut it anymore .
here in the united states , i think you see it in this election campaign : a longing for change .
and , long story short , again , they &apos;ve been so successful .
in particular , &quot; &quot; the supper at emmaus &quot; &quot; which was viewed as vermeer &apos;s finest masterpiece , his best work — people would come &#91; from &#93; all over the world to see it — was actually a forgery .
our ability to imagine makes us inventors and creators and unique .
and we have a little storage room where we converted a jail .
but saving is exactly the wrong thing to do from the system point of view .
second , in play , he &apos;s a national champion bridge player .
so the whole point of that is not , sort of , to make , like , a circus thing of showing exceptional beings who can jump , or whatever .
they most likely did the same as mr. domingos : &quot; &quot; ah ! what &apos;s this ? i &apos;m not understanding , it &apos;s going to the garbage &quot; &quot; .
and this is the pump .
he was back in luton , he was now 82 , and i hadn &apos;t seen him for 30-odd years , and when he opened the door , i saw this tiny little man with lambent , smiling eyes , and he was smiling , and i &apos;d never seen him smile .
warm-blooded animals take a huge hit at this time .
but when we think about the kind of possibilities i paint , we should feel a bit of fear .
i think it &apos;s excessive internet use in general , excessive video gaming , excessive new access to pornography .
the beauty of this is that once you plant a few dead bodies in that land , it can &apos;t be touched , it can &apos;t be developed on — hence the term , &quot; &quot; conservation burial . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s the equivalent of chaining yourself to a tree post-mortem — &quot; &quot; hell no , i won &apos;t go !
it &apos;s used for public health awareness campaigns such as the prevention of cholera .
ok , you can do that ? yeah ? ok .
it was also an expensive fight .
you don &apos;t need to believe me . you shouldn &apos;t believe me .
and because these are artists , they have very artistic temperaments .
and they did start to evolve .
now the americans in the audience will know all about cup stacking .
now let &apos;s take a look at hiv .
he will urinate and spin his tail to spread the urine around and make him more attractive .
and of course , it wasn &apos;t actually a working mine anymore , because , though ray was a miner there , the mine had closed and had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction , because , of course , it can &apos;t compete on the scale of operations which are happening in south america , australia , wherever .
the protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women like rose mapendo .
you see all of these nuances .
now , it &apos;s clear that our investment in breast cancer has produced results .
it took 23 hours . i did it with my neurosurgeon .
needless to list them here , and there are more competent people to talk about this .
the amount of a moderate-to-severe snow melting of an area equivalent to the size of california .
those who were still around in school , besides the people who had dropped out .
you can imagine , the musicians were disconsolate .
thank you all very much .
and all over india , at the end of about two years , children were beginning to google their homework .
could we reinvent fire ?
but we observed that there are no cells entering the brains of these animals .
they dance , they act — and the more they do , they are praised .
and that was one of the reasons why the web wasn &apos;t quite as emergent as it could be because you needed two-way linking , you needed that kind of feedback mechanism to be able to really do interesting things .
when those mujahideen defeated the soviet union , we disengaged .
this is just an example of one of these computable documents .
and the answer is , every single swedish business leader does that every single day .
yeah . i thought so . not surprised .
so , why would you want to replicate bit strings ?
we look at the savings rate and it has been declining since the 1950s .
they &apos;re actually identical , so it &apos;s quite cost-effective .
we turned the building into what we called now the archive house .
so , when we look back and step out at this and see the beginning of these trends that we &apos;re seeing in our data , we see a very hopeful picture for the future of america .
when something becomes ultra-low cost , it becomes massively scalable .
our kids &apos; teachers seem to be failing them .
or if we analyzed our data by sex .
so it &apos;s something we need to focus on .
they can produce loud clicks and listen for echoes from the sea floor in order to orient .
we actually saw seals out of our car window , and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them and then blocked them with our giant heads .
( laughter ) piles of dirty socks on the floor , more boring sports shows than i ever thought possible — ( laughter ) and fights that bring me to tears when it feels like we &apos;re not speaking the same language .
but what &apos;s really important here is , look at all those dots .
iw : but last year , we did exactly that .
when she spoke to the three friends and the stranger , they had not had a nice time — it &apos;s actually rather difficult , it &apos;s rather awkward ...
they were things like , what are the capitals of the 44 or 45 states that existed at that time ?
but we try to stand on our feet , to do something , little things , we can for our people .
this guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named ami tabar .
i &apos;m just showing the new york times website here .
but today , i &apos;m going to use a different approach , one that is inspired by these two initiatives here , a harmonic one and a philosophical one .
one of my favorites has always been : &quot; make love to your man in a chevy van , &quot; because that was my vehicle when i was in college .
this is worthy of sachin tendulkar .
and as an activist , that was not good enough .
so these action neighborhoods , as i call them , really become the inspiration to imagine other interpretations of citizenship that have less to do , in fact , with belonging to the nation-state , and more with upholding the notion of citizenship as a creative act that reorganizes institutional protocols in the spaces of the city .
the other third didn &apos;t lie , or perhaps forgot , or you &apos;re lying to me about your lying , which is very , very devious . ( laughter ) this fits with a lot of the research , which suggests that lying is very pervasive .
so then we said , how many people were executed on march 29 , 1984 ?
( laughter ) and i heard that , and that was all i needed .
and now let &apos;s compare that with fish farming .
the fact : population growth in countries with high laptop — ( laughter ) i need hans rosling to give me a graph .
ca : that scale delivers efficiency .
i think if marianne and the members of her women &apos;s group can talk about this openly and have this discussion out amongst themselves and in public , we can , too .
as you can see on this map , russia is still the largest country in the world .
management reports are full of complaints about the lack of clarity .
in too many 401 ( k ) plans , if people do nothing , it means they &apos;re not saving for retirement , if they don &apos;t check the box .
you will feel loved and appreciated like never before and reconnect with friends and acquaintances you haven &apos;t heard from in years .
and we did . we got better material .
be sure to enjoy windows for radio at home and at work .
and that gets me to one of the biggest deals about 3d printing .
but there &apos;s also the fact that law is another place where there are many opinions in circulation , but they need to be resolved to one canonical copy , and when you go onto github , and you look around , there are millions and millions of projects , almost all of which are source code , but if you look around the edges , you can see people experimenting with the political ramifications of a system like that .
they say you never forget the names of those who die .
but once they find it , that dna is still tiny , and surrounded by so much other dna , that what these machines then do is copy the target gene , and one copy piles on top of another , millions and millions and millions of copies , until that gene stands out against the rest ; until we can visualize it , interpret it , read it , understand it , until we can answer : does my pig have the flu ?
this high level group agreed to honestly discuss the merits and flaws of drug policies .
well , fascinatingly , it turns out that if you give children antibiotics in the first six months of life , they &apos;re more likely to become obese later on than if they don &apos;t get antibiotics then or only get them later , and so what we do early on may have profound impacts on the gut microbial community and on later health that we &apos;re only beginning to understand .

in many african countries the modern sector is lost .
but it could spread everywhere .

so this is attempting to make potato starch plastic .
what &apos;s the difference ?
so , this theory is that the brain creates , builds , a version of the universe , and projects this version of the universe , like a bubble , all around us .
it &apos;s just a lesion formed inside .
because i had someone dear to me snatched away .

cell phones are thrown away by the hundreds of millions every year , hundreds of millions in the u.s. alone , not counting the rest of the world , which of course we should do , but in fact , cell phones are great .
this may be surprising .
it has shrunk because our instruments enable us in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time , and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding of the material world , and this granular understanding has generated reams of data that our brains can no longer comprehend and for which we need more and more complicated computers .
so they all have his number .
so this is great . this is the digital meeting the physical .
( laughter ) it &apos;s a great way to start sentences .
and as she was talking , a thought came to my mind .
we have skin enhancements , clothing .

the solution , i think , is that we use language at two levels : the literal form signals the safest relationship with the listener , whereas the implicated content — the reading between the lines that we count on the listener to perform — allows the listener to derive the interpretation which is most relevant in context , which possibly initiates a changed relationship .
the second initiative was also home-grown , but is today a global movement to reform the international drug control regime .
