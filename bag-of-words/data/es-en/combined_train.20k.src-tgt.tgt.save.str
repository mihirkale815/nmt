my eyes went onto type ii .
we asked them , &quot; &quot; can you send guerrillas a message ? &quot; &quot; we collected over 6,000 messages .
bear in mind there are two things about this .
and again , it forms the same straight line . you have a little bit of thickening in the line because people do have disagreements , what the key points are , there &apos;s differences of opinion when agriculture started , or how long the cambrian explosion took .
in our daily life we are continuously disturbed by aggressive sounds .
low-income people spend a lot more than a thousand on lotteries .
we &apos;d catch cat-naps at 40 below on our sled , incidentally .
of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular .
so she did things to us , which now she &apos;d be arrested for , such as pushing us out of the car , and telling us to find our own way to granny &apos;s , about five miles before we actually got there .
but i &apos;ve talked about education and employment .
but perhaps the most exciting thing about it is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere .
they could be quite mild .
it &apos;s capitalism as it was ultimately meant to be , meeting important needs , not incrementally competing for trivial differences in product attributes and market share .
but i claim that b is incomparably worse .
so if i were emperor of the internet , i guess i &apos;d still be mortal , huh ?
and it completely changed how i do movies .
and he &apos;s seriously one of the funniest — i call him yoda , because you talk to the guy , you get an email from him , and you &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m not worthy . this guy &apos;s so amazing . &quot; &quot; the other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world — literally every corner of the world — into our house .
don &apos;t start telling me why you didn &apos;t do something .
as i looked down at her in the bed , i thought to myself , if you just tried caring even a little bit , you wouldn &apos;t be in this situation at this moment with some doctor you &apos;ve never met about to amputate your foot .
he said , &quot; &quot; how did target figure out that this high school girl was pregnant before she told her parents ? &quot; &quot; it turns out that they have the purchase history for hundreds of thousands of customers and they compute what they call a pregnancy score , which is not just whether or not a woman &apos;s pregnant , but what her due date is .
and let &apos;s say it &apos;s a foundation . they will provide the funds .
jp : oh , hi darling , how are you ?
they &apos;re also able to reason at high levels .
derek paravicini : i taught myself to play .
and what can you do to challenge ?
and when people tell me , &quot; &quot; who &apos;s going to teach the teachers to teach the kids ? &quot; &quot; i say to myself , &quot; &quot; what planet do you come from ? &quot; &quot; okay , there &apos;s not a person in this room — i don &apos;t care how techie you are — there &apos;s not a person in this room that doesn &apos;t give their laptop or cell phone to a kid to help them debug it . ok ?
so this building actually celebrates the water as it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed so that it can be filtered for the final time .
i took this video last week . here &apos;s a paraplegic patient actually walking by strapping on these exoskeletons .
so he was using social media in private .
not to say , &quot; &quot; oh my god , what is it ? &quot; &quot; but to be challenged by it — to say , &quot; &quot; wow , this is beautiful , &quot; &quot; on one level , but on the other level , &quot; &quot; this is scary . i shouldn &apos;t be enjoying it . &quot; &quot; like a forbidden pleasure . and it &apos;s that forbidden pleasure that i think is what resonates out there , and it gets people to look at these things , and it gets people to enter it . and it also , in a way , defines kind of what i feel , too — that i &apos;m drawn to have a good life .
we have a moral obligation to invent technology so that every person on the globe has the potential to realize their true difference .
is there a way to produce algae inexpensively ?
and thank you very much .
if a company was going to donate a block of a decision scientist &apos;s time , it would actually make more sense to spread out that block of time over a long period , say for example five years .
you can see the different seasons there .
of course , this was the holy grail of our industry , and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn &apos;t help either , because i &apos;m sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store , you know — we see his face constantly .
and scientists that have studied this have said they &apos;ve never seen an accident .
( laughter ) but you get the picture . and then it goes to the inauguration .
there are , of course , the therapeutic results of this , but then there are the un-therapeutic ones and they seem to be the ones gaining traction , particularly in the media .
in a 12-month period when i was at the orphanage , only one child had been adopted .
and so now all the birds come in . and i have hawks .
do you know how hard that is to avoid when you actually work at facebook ?
so ...
you know , i like to call it &quot; &quot; the national automobile slum . &quot; &quot; you can call it suburban sprawl .
so the cambrian explosion , when all the body plans of the animals were evolved , took only 10 million years . it was 200 times faster .
and as for outsiders , white , black or brown , tar and feather them , and whip them out of town .
we kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics and that selects for resistant mutants .
we &apos;re really good at small numbers .
and then i thought i would share with you what that method is , or one of them .
now what we &apos;re seeing lots of examples of , obviously , is the opening up of government data , not enough examples of this yet , but we &apos;re starting to see this practice of people creating and generating innovative applications on top of government data .
but when you shake it , you get pakistan &apos;s perspective .
and he had to close his eyes , it &apos;s so disgusting , and the smell and everything .
&quot; use a condom , don &apos;t get aids . &quot;
but first i want to say that the intensity and persistence with which we experience these emotional components of regret is obviously going to vary depending on the specific thing that we &apos;re feeling regretful about .
in particular , i &apos;m interested in the relationship to the future financial self .
an image is worth more than a thousand words , so i &apos;m going to start my talk by stop talking and show you a few images that i recently captured .
i am passionate about the american landscape and how the physical form of the land , from the great central valley of california to the bedrock of manhattan , has really shaped our history and our character .
my mother in accra , my twin sister in boston , my best friends in new york : these relationships are home for me .
okay ? so i want you to think about that problem as we go on , and count how many symmetries there are .
so dystonia is a disorder affecting children .
were invented by dr. yoram palti , professor emeritus at the technion in israel .
we knew conservation would fail if it doesn &apos;t work to improve the lives of the local communities .
it has taken many years , but it has been very rewarding .
you needn &apos;t bring the gun into the uk anymore .
i &apos;m showing you two works , one on the right by leon golub , one on the left by robert colescott .
and i &apos;ve been studying it for a couple years .
he died 25 years ago this year , and was born 75 years ago this year .
in countless accidents , the driver says , &quot; i didn &apos;t see it coming . &quot;
it &apos;s too much energy on a planet .
( laughter ) paper .
so let me tell you about the u-report , which i &apos;m really excited about . it &apos;s 150,000 millennials all across uganda , young people armed with 2g phones , an sms social network exposing government corruption and demanding to know what &apos;s in the budget and how their money is being spent .
it &apos;s become the de facto battle for gay equality , and it seems like daily , laws prohibiting it are being challenged in the courts , even in places like texas and utah , which no one saw coming .
most of our countries don &apos;t even have any opinion research .
i &apos;ve discovered these people , who , in v-day world , we call vagina warriors .
trend-following would have been great in the &apos; 60s , and it was sort of ok in the &apos; 70s .
and you could tell very easily when your experiment was working and wasn &apos;t , and where it was in the phase .
i don &apos;t think it will transport 200 people in the next years .
mb : so i love the effervescence , bubbling up .
they don &apos;t own those facilities .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever felt so happy in my entire life .
i was privileged to have that kind of good start .
so , this is a six-shot sequence .
and what they &apos;re finding is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants can be highly toxic to phytoplankton , which is very bad news , because so much life depends on it .
i &apos;ll leave it at that , thank you very much .
fast forward to 2002 .
and the rules and the belief systems were wildly disparate .
three years later , we have the perimeter institute for theoretical physics in waterloo , ontario . it ’ s the most exciting job i ’ ve ever had .
and that &apos;s the kind of polishing that these mirrors have endured .
i really believe that you have to have a passion for it .
now we do daydreaming in 11 : 30 with 55 seconds left .
and that was the end of the shrinking of vacuum tubes , but it was not the end of the exponential growth of computing .
and this is the first theater project i worked on .
what you see there on the screen is a human hair superimposed on the needle that &apos;s made of silk — just to give you a sense of size .
now looking at a few cases , here &apos;s one of the first cases that we had .
so does a site like this have rules ?
this happens because typically tumors are areas where the immune system has no access , and so bacteria find these tumors and use them as a safe haven to grow and thrive .
and she said to them , &quot; &quot; vusi &apos;s here , and you &apos;re not going to take him tonight .
now , the himba live in northern namibia on the border of angola , and i &apos;d been there a few times before , and i &apos;d gone back to present this book i &apos;d made , to show them the pictures , to get into a discussion with them , to say , &quot; &quot; this is how i saw you . this is how i love you .
if they stick with the process , if they stick with it , they end up doing amazing things and they surprise themselves just how innovative they and their teams really are .
now , given both the common sense and scientific data calling the doctrine of the blank slate into question , why should it have been such an appealing notion ?
i looked it up , and he was right .
♫ not to discuss this at length , ♫ ♫ but my body image was never my strength . ♫ ♫ so frankly , i wish that you all would get dressed , ♫ ♫ i mean , you &apos;re not even really naked . ♫ ♫ and i &apos;m the one with the problem . ♫ ♫ and you tell me , don &apos;t worry so much , you &apos;ll be great . ♫ ♫ but i &apos;m the one living with me ♫ ♫ and i know how i get . ♫ ♫ your advice is gentle but late . ♫ ♫ if not just a bit patronizing . ♫ ♫ and that sarcastic tone doesn &apos;t help me when i sing . ♫
several western companies are now adopting frugal innovation to create affordable products for western consumers .
this region responds when you think about what another person is thinking .
the result : most of the deaths have been in people under 30 years of age , robustly healthy young adults .
and it &apos;s part of what tedwomen does .
and that is the same reef ; that &apos;s the same reef 15 years ago ; that &apos;s the same reef today .
he took women with metastatic breast cancer , randomly divided them into two groups .
as a matter of fact , 1964 was the year with the highest birth rate ever in germany : more than 1.3 million .
my desire to create a sensor-based technology perhaps stemmed from my lifelong love for sensors and technology .
and it &apos;s this convergence that gives us this incredible pace .
but the only way we &apos;re going to be able to write it is if we do it together .
and here , you can see one such example , where we label the fibers coming from the brain in red .
just to give you a few examples : &quot; ending a pregnancy &quot; versus &quot; killing a fetus ; &quot; &quot; a ball of cells &quot; versus &quot; an unborn child ; &quot; &quot; invading iraq &quot; versus &quot; liberating iraq ; &quot; &quot; redistributing wealth &quot; versus &quot; confiscating earnings . &quot;
and those beautiful wispy clouds are , in fact , fires , human-made fires .
it &apos;s a gambler &apos;s game even today .
you see the heart coming out there . it takes about 40 minutes to print , and about four to six hours later you see the muscle cells contract .
i photographed him at the scene of arrest in chicago .
you &apos;d stay until , at some point , the jail would be booked to capacity , and they &apos;d want to book someone new in .
but how can i tell an eight-year-old boy that his father is a politician ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) now , as a politician myself , standing in front of you , or indeed , meeting any stranger anywhere in the world , when i eventually reveal the nature of my profession , they look at me as though i &apos;m somewhere between a snake , a monkey and an iguana , and through all of this , i feel , strongly , that something is going wrong .
even the pencil .
now just don &apos;t untie me no matter what . &quot; &quot; he throws the first mate to the ground .
but we have to use its power wisely .
thank you .
and there , we sat down , and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on mt . everest .
that gets your adrenaline going .
right ? it &apos;s beans ; right ? it &apos;s coffee beans .
well , if we &apos;re going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of millennium development goals that we &apos;re set as a world , we need to learn from the innovators , and those innovators come from every single sector .
( laughter ) it &apos;s pretty scary . ( laughter )
truth be told , i have never found a role model i could truly identify with .
but of course , that was in austria at the height of romantic lyricism , not here in the suburbs of cleveland . ( laughter )
and this excites me , because this means that the energy it takes to accommodate someone with a disability can be leveraged , molded and played with as a force for creativity and innovation .
it &apos;s got two people inside it on stilts , which give them the height , and somebody in the front who &apos;s using a kind of steering wheel to move that head .
and when you label something as objective and rational , automatically , the other side , the subjective and emotional , become labeled as non-science or anti-science or threatening to science , and we just don &apos;t talk about it .
no bill ever disappeared .
there &apos;s sustaining innovation , which will sustain an existing institution or an organization , and disruptive innovation that will break it apart , create some different way of doing it .
we know we &apos;ll use electricity in 20 or 30 years &apos; time .
they give 20 minutes — that &apos;s a time warning .
but in order to find out the real secrets of these creatures &#91; it was necessary &#93; for us to actually insert a small radio transmitter inside &#91; each &#93; snake .
in this strange moment where , like , these things kind of appeared .
so this is a — i used to kind of be an actor .
so again , the really important question is what happens when we change the statistical data ever so slightly .
doctors have a saying that , in fact , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re not dead until you &apos;re warm and dead . &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s true . it &apos;s true .
it &apos;s an insult to the basic laws of nature and of biology .
so there are many reasons , and for all of these reasons , this is time and this is why we must talk .
ss : well , on your way to the olympics , a couple of memorable events happened at georgetown .
i &apos;d like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward .
this object should be ice over a silicate core .
that story perfectly captures for me the final lesson that i learned : happiness is not something we find , it &apos;s something we make .
now we &apos;ve had 50 years of warnings .
and then magd came .
for a minute , i felt like my existence as a person had been noticed , and i was worth saving .
that &apos;s why when , in california , we try to deal with all the solar we &apos;ve brought online — we now get about 10 percent of electricity from solar — when the sun goes down , and people come home from work and turn on their air conditioners and their tv sets , and every other appliance in the house , we need a lot of natural gas backup .
one of those most remarkable parts about all of this is it gives us an entirely new way to understand new information , stuff that we haven &apos;t seen before .
we branch off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
i had a scholarship .
well , one of the problems , of course , turns out to be testing .
well , you feel some chest pain or indigestion .
if you don &apos;t tell us how you did it , we won &apos;t trust you .
the moorish artists were denied the possibility to draw things with souls .
i end with — the koreans did this .
and that was because every hydrostatic skeleton that we had found in nature up to that point had the same basic elements .
actually , you could say i grew up in the capital of dominican republic , otherwise known as washington heights in new york city .
either a conscious agent is carrying out the computation , or he &apos;s got a piece of machinery that admits of a computational interpretation .
if the group doesn &apos;t take action , the other 33 groups have to decide what is going to happen to the group that doesn &apos;t comply with those great deals that we are offering them .
so what you &apos;re seeing here are a couple of machines — a pattern of locomotion .
chris anderson : so i guess what we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re going to talk about your life , and using some pictures that you shared with me .
this is one of the things they ought to be thinking more about .
and users , for all of us — we can demand technology that works this way .
buy african products .
as we think about intersecting technologies — everybody has a cell phone with a camera — we could use this everywhere , whether it be health care , patient care , engineering , law , conferencing , translating videos .
( audience : jack of spades . ) lg : jack of spades . jack of spades .
in this case , they were using a real stunt man . it was a very dangerous stunt .
( music ) another solo now . see what you can pick up from this . ( music )
and we &apos;re starting to be much more careful about how we save and how we invest .
the good-news stories in medicine are early detection , early intervention .
it basically directed the sounds onto a diaphragm that vibrated a needle that essentially engraved the sound on tinfoil that was wrapped around the cylinder .
it &apos;s one way of describing what happened with deregulation of the financial services in the u.s. and the u.k.
and this is interesting from an artistic point of view .
an ideograph is like a brush painting , a japanese brush painting .
they seem fantastic to me . they cost very little to develop .
the best way to spiral into a cycle of poverty is to kill the parents .
and it has been named okapi faunal reserve because of this beautiful creature .
i said , &quot; &quot; yes , your holiness .
so , without this technology you can &apos;t see the stars .
hopefully everybody ? more than 10 ?
this approach is called integrated water management , or holistic or closed-loop .
but here is what &apos;s really great .
we have the power to do that .
beyond these sorts of things , a medical doctor didn &apos;t have a lot that they could do .
go to the open house and express your options .
i mean , it seems like you &apos;re still a little bit in the growth phases , you &apos;re still doing these incredible new plans .
they even applaud it .
and as i pause for a few seconds , have a look at the screen .
and i &apos;m just going to read one of them to you .
would you like kim jong-il , who &apos;s killed about two million people , would you like him gone ?
essentially , here you have all the bling-bling of the world &apos;s museums organized for you .
and no tv , no radio , no newspaper , no one to talk to .
you get health insurance ? dental ?
imagine you are in a maternity ward in mali , and have a newborn in need of urgent medication .
they needed fewer hospitalizations .
and nature builds large skeletons out of it .
so we can actually use biomaterials now .
( music ) and just like that , the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality .
spect imaging is a brain-scanning technology that uses a radioactive tracer to track blood flow in the brain .
however , still , as you can see , it has a cord , umbilical cord . so , we &apos;re still using an external power source and external computation .
there &apos;s not one that we know of . &quot; &quot; so they &apos;re doing that , and we &apos;re going to launch it later this year , and it &apos;s all an experiment , and it &apos;s all voluntary .
so this is very conscious knowledge .
what force is driving all galaxies to rush away from every other at an ever-quickening speed ?
and the truth is i don &apos;t really understand a lot of what they &apos;re talking about .
where &apos;s art ? i got productivity . i got sports .
when i reach the summit of a steep mountain in the middle of nowhere , i feel young , invincible , eternal .
all of these thousands of loosely connected little pieces are coming together , and it &apos;s about time we ask the question , how do we want to evolve human beings over the next century or two ?
mt : which means magic is theater and every trick is a story .
i tried to think , &quot; &quot; how do i respond to that hopelessness ?
four years ago , i showed you this picture .
we need to be able to measure progression objectively , and ultimately , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure .
you can &apos;t do that with head-tail-tail .
why has it accelerated lately ?
we need lots more .
until quite recently , we simply didn &apos;t know how many brazilians were killed by guns .
my wife started to fine me one dollar for every irrelevant fact i inserted into conversation .
this is a challenge that we share with thousands of other researchers around the world .
it was , like , this is my time for shine .
if you ask men why they did a good job , they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m awesome .
it takes what we know , and it twists it .
my foot goes down its throat . it spits me out .
we live on a planet .
the lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles — a car approaching from the front , the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads , any obstacles around the vehicle .
also the visual separation .
a remarkable idea , and yet evidence is growing almost weekly , with new papers coming out , confirming that this does indeed take place .
and even though the color was pretty hideous , i did love the car , and it really cemented my love affair with cars that &apos;s continued on to this day .
parents pool their money to hire some local teachers to a private , tiny , unofficial school .
and shipping is the greenest method of transport .
one billion dollars of our taxpayers &apos; money has been located in offshore bank accounts .
it &apos;s the single largest emitter of greenhouse gases of any human activity in the world .
look , there is like 50-plus years of good cancer research that discovered major , major things that taught us about cancer .
and this is a song that &apos;s about — it &apos;s the kind of song that everyone has their version of .
ca : can we see that ? em : yeah .
muzetta &apos;s family give the lie to this .
we &apos;ve driven well over 100,000 miles now totally automated .
now this is not a problem of resources ; this is a problem of incentives .
so when i virtually touch data , it will generate forces in the pen , so i get a feedback .
( applause )
let &apos;s start with the hobbies . when you get dementia , it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself .
and into that ferment came the microprocessor .
i mean i &apos;ve rarely seen lines so flat .
this is a chicken with teeth .
&quot; that misses the point . &quot;
we evolved essentially from an african stock .
right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year that i &apos;ll talk a little bit about .
and i think that can be some really good news .
it &apos;s my response , my attitude , to oppression that i &apos;ve got control over , and that i can do something about .
well , the kids loved the food .
staying is the new shame .
what we see is a unique , personal , virtual reality that is masterfully constructed by our brain .
if the rules for the universe are simple , it &apos;s kind of inevitable that they have to be very abstract and very low level ; operating , for example , far below the level of space or time , which makes it hard to represent things .
ok , so the question is : do we see this in the sky ?
somebody told me today there was this thing called folders , but i don &apos;t know what they are .
but unless we start testing those intuitions , we &apos;re not going to do better .
that &apos;s getting closer .
i couldn &apos;t make it , &quot; &quot; everyone held her breath , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; everyone held his breath , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; everyone held his or her breath . &quot; &quot; whatever i suggested had to blend in .
in fact , i went to nashville .
as a result , déclassé consumption is in .
how can such a thing exist as part of the real world ? &quot; &quot; and this , if you &apos;ve ever had a philosophy course , this is known as the famous mind-body problem .
i haven &apos;t been shot at in six years , and i was woken up very abruptly this morning by a nightmare that i was being strafed by aircraft , six years later .
and in fact , even in that very first event , ligo found things that we didn &apos;t expect .
i mean , most of us know that pitch is a fundamental building block of music .
and you just saw motts the research engineer , there , going into the mri system , and he was wearing goggles .
several years ago , we started thinking about it .
it becomes kite-shaped .
people began to buy their own postcards and make their own postcards .
their treatment is a reflection of the values held beyond prison walls .
she &apos;s being filmed with a hidden camera .
that &apos;s why we all live in developer houses .
this is a very small grain of sand , this whole thing .
it &apos;s great stuff .
he asked the pga , the professional golfers &apos; association , for permission to use a golf cart in the pga tournaments .
so when nicolaus copernicus said , actually the earth is not the center of the universe , the sun is the center of the solar system , the earth moves around the sun .
he quoted the words of all kinds of people who &apos;d had a variety of these experiences .
but really , it wasn ’ t the drugs that were important ; it was this idea that what the drugs did would help shock people out of their normal way of thinking , and getting them to forget the adult behaviors that were getting in the way of their ideas .
what you &apos;re seeing here is , we &apos;ve selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient .
and this is great because , you know , for a quarter , you can play this for a long time . ( laughter )
you can hold it like a liver , but it has no cells ; it &apos;s just a skeleton of the liver .
for every one single neuron , you can actually have from 10,000 to 100,000 different connections or dendrites or whatever you want to call it , and every time you learn something , or you have an experience , that bush grows , you know , that bush of information .
so by the time i &apos;m finished talking here , there &apos;ll be 864 more hours of video on youtube than there were when i started , and two and a half million more photos on facebook and instagram than when i started .
using acoustic emission , you know , this little noise that you hear a structure emit , sing to you when they are stressed , and reveal the damage going on , there &apos;s a collective phenomenon of positive feedback , the more damage gives the more damage , so you can actually predict , within , of course , a probability band , when the rupture will occur .
so let &apos;s move to chapter two : the oil era .
now , you need a laptop .
so we did .
in our fears , the characters are us .
the 20th century , the last hundred years , is riddled with disastrous examples of times that one school or the other tried to explain the past or predict the future and just did an awful , awful job , so the economics profession has acquired some degree of modesty .
if i &apos;m going to use the word &quot; &quot; wednesday &quot; &quot; in a sentence , and i &apos;m coming up to the word , and i can feel that i &apos;m going to stutter or something , i can change the word to &quot; &quot; tomorrow , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; the day after tuesday , &quot; &quot; or something else .
the first is electric autonomous flying vehicles .
when will it catch up ? i have to go back to very conventional graph .
so this is what russian looks like in a visual abstraction .
so thank goodness , they can &apos;t be used to engineer viruses or bacteria .
we can &apos;t afford the fanciest places to stay at night , so we tend to sleep a lot outdoors .
the schizophrenic mind is not split , but shattered .
sexual reproduction enters the picture .
15 years later , 14 or 15 years later , follow-up study .
and what we found was very , very interesting .
i had to practice it as a kid , and i &apos;m really sick of it . so — ( laughter ) i would , so what i might like to try to do is to change it , to transform it in some ways , to personalize it , so i might take the opening , like this idea — ( music ) and then i might substitute — ( music ) and then i might improvise on that melody that goes forward from there — ( music ) ( music ) so that might be the kind of thing — why thank you .
so now what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to vary the order in which these decisions appear .
poignant .
and also , again , it can — also , it &apos;s something that you — it is not something that is radiating outside .
together , we looked at a variety of biological systems , ranging from natural tropical rainforests through to managed forests and fisheries .
simply documenting these soon-to-be-demolished structures wasn &apos;t enough for me .
while browsing facebook , i saw a photo , a terrifying photo , of a tortured , dead body of a young egyptian guy .
and some people get rich enough , and if they have their ideals — in a sort of domestic sense , they get to acquire their perfect world .
if you look at some of these other items — concussions .
we need to build a log cabin , if you will , at the bottom of the sea .
you might enjoy the awkwardly tight , cut-off pajama bottoms with balloons .
we actually have a very interesting payload on there .
thank you .
and , in a way , i wanted the human figure in the picture to become a part of that nature .
thank you .
no , i &apos;m not even from jamaica . that &apos;s how they market me .
and he managed to track down , whitehead did , many of the cases of people who had drunk water from the pump , or who hadn &apos;t drunk water from the pump .
down the coast here in california , the redwood forest grows to 40 stories tall .
this is a figure from a textbook on underwater sound .
because if you happen to find this one inside your body , you &apos;re in big trouble , because that &apos;s the source code for ebola .
and this isn &apos;t just found in packaging .
now looking at these images , it &apos;s difficult to grasp the scale of this operation , which can already be seen from space and could grow to an area the size of england .
some of you might already know him .
so we really had to think about new , creative ways to flavor , new ways to cook and to change texture — and that was the main issue with this challenge .
even though this wasn &apos;t the direction we went because the crank — it really is stupid to have it on board , by the way .
and that &apos;s to take all the co2 , after you &apos;ve burned it , going out the flue , pressurize it , create a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it stays there .
people want to customize their lives .
so , what technology brought , through the very simple tools like these stone tools here — even something as small as this — the early bands of humans were actually able to eliminate to extinction about 250 megafauna animals in north america when they first arrived 10,000 years ago .
here &apos;s one possibility : basically , countries represent power .
i was a young man who believed that jihad is to be understood in the language of force and violence .
she bought a bright red karmann ghia with the money she made working at burger king .
hope you &apos;re doing well . i &apos;m fine here . everything &apos;s good .
so that is to show that the solar cell acts as a receiver .
( video ) abe davis : three , two , one , go .
i &apos;m supposed to scare you , because it &apos;s about fear , right ?
we &apos;ve taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit so that we &apos;ve made antagonists of the interspecies communication system .
it was 25 minutes of absolute terror that thousands of people across the u.s. felt .
but you know , there is progress being made in places like cambodia and thailand .
and we try to do this for as long as possible .
and it was the same — learning by rote — from primary school through graduate school .
i was so determined to survive that i used my scarf to tie tourniquets around the tops of my legs , and i just shut everything and everyone out , to focus , to listen to myself , to be guided by instinct alone .
but what i &apos;ve learned through speaking with people and writing about these ideas on my website , is that there are some tremendous strengths to being this way .
suddenly , the two common threats that had pushed them closer together throughout decades , more or less evaporated .
is it like gravity , which is the same everywhere in the universe , or there would be all kinds of different biochemistries wherever we find them ?
that &apos;s nice .
and let me give you two examples .
his idea of jihad was a global war of terror , primarily targeted at the far enemy , at the crusaders from the west , against america .
and so what happened — and i think there will probably be some people in the audience that will identify with this — i went to my first meeting , first at the u.n. , and that &apos;s when this all started , because that is a very male organization .
( applause ) bg : thank you . mg : thank you very much .
such hidden biases and black-box algorithms that researchers uncover sometimes but sometimes we don &apos;t know , can have life-altering consequences .
&quot; &quot; let her go , let her go , god bless her wherever she may be she can search this whole wide world all over but she &apos;ll never find another man like me she can search this whole wide world all over and she &apos;ll never find another man like me when i die , please god , bury me in my ten-dollar stetson hat put a twenty-dollar gold piece on my watch chain so my friends know i died standing pat get six gamblers to carry my coffin and six choir girls to sing me a song stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon to raise hell as i go along
it &apos;s small and large . this is an ashtray , a water glass .
there &apos;s two spheres and they &apos;re separated in distance .
this is in the mandara mountains , near the nigerian border in cameroon , mokoulek .
imagine that you &apos;ve been raped and you &apos;re bringing up a boy child .
a third interview was conducted with someone about the north pole .
that &apos;s not going to be changed at all .
thank you very much .
i couldn &apos;t go out and play basketball at recess without feeling like i was going to pass out when i got back inside .
so even though when the powder was poison , the friend drank the coffee and died , people say grace deserves less blame in that case , when she innocently thought it was sugar , than in the other case , where she thought it was poison and no harm occurred .
so netra and i really wanted to use our 200-year plan to curate this digital legacy , and not only digital legacy but we believe in curating the legacy of my past and future .
but i think there &apos;s something really poetic about using nuclear power to propel us to the stars , because the stars are giant fusion reactors .
this is what is killing productivity , what makes people suffer at work .
i challenge each and every one of you to mentor someone different .
now , we &apos;ve gotten to a point where today , the machine understands complex events like down screens and wide pins .
it looks like a car wash . you come into your car wash .
if they &apos;re real boxes , there &apos;s not much we can do , but in a game we can just say , &quot; &quot; right , well .
in infrastructure , let &apos;s just take one example .
it doesn &apos;t need light .
that is all aid can be .
i made a hole in the boundary wall of the slum next to my office , and stuck a computer inside it just to see what would happen if i gave a computer to children who never would have one , didn &apos;t know any english , didn &apos;t know what the internet was .
you need also state ownership , especially of land assets , in order to build and roll out infrastructures very quickly .
that change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift , not only in the fortunes of monterey bay , but other places around the world .
and every single part of this mechanism is actually plausible in biology .
and so you too can type in any word or phrase that you &apos;re interested in and see its n-gram immediately — also browse examples of all the various books in which your n-gram appears .
and seeing what happens , it was ok to generalize , and say , i &apos;m sure that this will happen anytime we make one of these things .
as well as triggering severe loss of memory and mental abilities , the damage to the brain caused by alzheimer &apos;s significantly reduces life expectancy and is always fatal .
there is an invisible beauty all around us , each grain with a story to tell ...
thank you very much .
the rain and the wind will take them off anyway .
( applause )
and it hasn &apos;t been published , so it &apos;s totally privy information just for ted .
a neuron under the microscope is very elegant with little things sticking out and little things over here , but when you start to put them together in a complex system , and you start to see that it becomes a brain , and that brain can create intelligence , what we &apos;re talking about in the body , and cancer is starting to model it like a complex system .
he &apos;s thinking about what he &apos;s got to do to save himself .
( applause ) trans people and trans issues , they &apos;ve been getting a lot of mainstream media attention lately .
here &apos;s sort of the end of that 10 years of work .
thank you . ( applause ) thanks very much . ( applause )
it &apos;s not a matter of teaching it ; in fact , most of the schools tend to discount intuition as an ingredient of your working process because they can &apos;t quantify it : it &apos;s very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design , but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card or a newsletter .
post-white house , he opened an investment firm called generation , where he baked environmental sustainability and other things right into the core investment process .
but anyway , off to the world of ice .
i knew that i might get hacked for giving this talk , so let me save you the effort .
well , somebody had a great idea .
and all the eastern religions except japan had the same level .
guess how much it costs to call rwanda , ghana , nigeria ?
these are going at a relative speed of two meters per second , and this illustrates the basic principle .
the car begins to slide out , dramatic maneuver to correct it , and no change whatsoever in the mental workload .
is our government that generous ? and maybe they are .
now science may dismiss this methodology , but polynesian navigators use it today because it provides them an accurate determination of the angle and direction of their vessel .
but before we get there , we &apos;re engaged in a struggle between good and evil , the good of socialism against the evil of capitalism , and the good shall triumph .
what you &apos;re looking at over here is actually the first unit that i know of of non-human currency .
the best available answer is that they were literally the earliest known works of art , practical tools transformed into captivating aesthetic objects , contemplated both for their elegant shape and their virtuoso craftsmanship .
china also believes that it is being contained by u.s. allies and by those with strategic partnerships with the u.s.
&quot; &quot; because you don &apos;t love us , norman , clearly you &apos;ve chosen your path . &quot; &quot; twenty-four hours later , my social worker , this strange man who used to visit me every couple of months , he &apos;s waiting for me in the car as i say goodbye to my parents .
and just like that , you &apos;ve been seduced into a different way of looking at something because the endorphins have brought down your defenses .
the poor puppy jumps up , you open the dog book , what does it say ?
and actually , they &apos;re very quickly becoming a reality .
anyone who saves a life , saves the life of all humanity .
but they probably don &apos;t think of these opinions as expertise .
no , the fact is , america really is crazy when it comes to drugs .
this may not seem to impress , but technological evolution is progressive , so another 10 , 20,000 years , and armaments technology takes you here .
and we have a school . this is our bright — we opened &#91; in the &#93; last two years &#91; an &#93; elementary school where we have 850 children , and the majority are women and girls .
( laughter ) thank you very much .
and i was always secretly hoping in some part of me that what was being said to me and about me wasn &apos;t ...
every individual starts pushing in one direction and this is what happens .
the connection i have with engineering is the same as any other engineer , in that i love to solve problems .
for example , how a nightlight works , or why an elevator door stays open , or how an ipod responds to touch .
and a good example of this is the rio tinto , which is in portugal .
and the reason this picture &apos;s in here is i did this slide show a couple years ago at a big economics summit , and there was a fellow in the audience who came up to me .
since the age of five , i started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence .
punishment and examinations are seen as threats .
we are so used to doing monologues .
they took pictures of me spread on the police car , and they laughed .
i said , &quot; &quot; and second of all , bad things happen to children every day , and if you didn &apos;t want these retinas , they would probably be buried in the ground right now .
and it &apos;ll be another six billion before that happens , and any remaining life on earth is vaporized .
though , i do know what this means — i think you do too .
so here &apos;s the question : can we grow axons and neurons down these channels ?
basically what it told me was — ( laughter ) ( applause ) — the kinds of countries we prefer are good countries .
the comparisons we make when we are appraising value , where we &apos;re trying to estimate how much we &apos;ll like things , are not the same comparisons we &apos;ll be making when we consume them .
did you know that 68 percent of americans now carry a library card ?
he was making , on average a week , $ 150,000 — tax free of course .
so we got some shows off the ground . we started touring them internationally .
( applause )
thank you .
we can weave them , knit them , or we can make them like you see here .
the first thing that i learned is when you &apos;re holding your breath , you should never move at all ; that wastes energy .
they know , as someone once said , &quot; character &apos;s who you are in the dark . &quot;
and when the land-based ice of the arctic melts , it raises sea level .
because when you go higher , the atmosphere is getting thinner , it &apos;s getting more unstable , the temperature is getting cooler , and you have a lot more u.v. radiation .
and he is one amazing example of what i have experienced all over africa .
so what is a story ?
and in experimental feedings to rodents and ferrets , we found that the animals exhibit symptoms never seen with flu : seizures , central nervous system disorders , partial paralysis .
and , you know , if you think about this with the tsunami , what you have is essentially a kind of an army of local journalists , who are producing enormous amounts of material for no reason other than to tell their stories .
this was really the bastion of the french enlightenment , and this gorgeous illustration was featured as a table of contents for the encyclopedia .
i &apos;m optimistic , because the new machine age is digital , exponential and combinatorial .
but it &apos;s a famous picture , not because of the beauty and majesty of saturn &apos;s rings , but actually because of a tiny , faint blob just hanging underneath one of the rings .
i was ready to tell him , &quot; &quot; listen , if someone such-and-such comes tomorrow , please tell him that it was a mistake .
something i truly believe .
( applause ) and why only computers ? we can just play with papers .
but 60 years of research has demonstrated that separating children from their families and placing them in large institutions seriously harms their health and development , and this is particularly true for young babies .
and i &apos;ve been very supportive until this picture shows up on my facebook page . ( laughter ) and i actually untagged myself first , then i picked up the phone . i said , &quot; &quot; mom , you will never put a picture of me in a bikini ever again . &quot; &quot; and she said , &quot; &quot; why ? you look so cute , darling . &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; you just don &apos;t understand . &quot;
are there any monkeys here ?
he believed that the crystal was the model for all kinds of representation .
he proclaimed his innocence , his family screamed at the jury , his fiancée collapsed on the floor sobbing , and titus is taken away to jail .
but something interesting happened .
most of that money is parked in bank deposits that give you zero percent interest rate .
so , one of these examples would of course be the historic city of venice .
they &apos;re connecting partly , and perhaps even mainly , because they all belong to one body and one brain .
they give rise to the trees , they create the debris fields that feed the mycelium .
you want people to use clean needles — and junkies want to use clean needles .
the teacher &apos;s role is entirely obsolete .
now we have sprawling residential suburbias that are well distinct from production areas and commercial areas .
dad talked a lot about bad design when we were growing up , you know , &quot; &quot; bad design is just people not thinking , john , &quot; &quot; he would say whenever a kid would be injured by a rotary lawn mower or , say , a typewriter ribbon would get tangled or an eggbeater would get jammed in the kitchen .
and if you just go back to the previous image , and you look at this area of volatility and hostility , that a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture could have the affect of bringing all those warring factions together in a united cause , in terms of something that would be genuinely green and productive in the widest sense .
the brain will do more of whatever got that reward .
because ed , like vineet , understands that our role as leaders is to set the stage , not perform on it .
what do we have to get to to achieve the global goals ?
so , these gloves are a little bit small on me , but here it is .
the first is that social connections are really good for us , and that loneliness kills .
astrolabes have an incredible history .
it &apos;s a special kind of material that , when you add water , it will swell up enormously , maybe a thousand times in volume .
learning to play piano for the first time and playing four hands with a friend , or performing a ridiculous skit with friends looking like idiots — things like that .
and so in that sense , i &apos;m much more optimistic about what humans can do .
how is that going to make you feel and what decision might you make next time ?
look at the nuclei . the nuclei in the cell on the left is in the animal , the one on the right is in a dish .
and so the researchers asked themselves , &quot; &quot; i wonder how many times very secure , important , sensitive conversations are happening on these two-way radios where they forget to encrypt and they don &apos;t notice that they didn &apos;t encrypt ? &quot; &quot; so they bought a scanner . these are perfectly legal and they run at the frequency of the p25 , and what they did is they hopped around frequencies and they wrote software to listen in .
so as a result , i decided to open up a private practice , and i became the first foreigner to litigate in afghan courts .
if you want to give some of your own money to punish people who aren &apos;t contributing , you can do that . &quot; &quot; and as soon as people heard about the punishment issue going on , cooperation shoots up .
it also changed our lives in many unexpected ways , and those unexpected ways we later reflected on , that eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us , and a year later , we launched babble , a website for parents .
it &apos;s basically a nuclear-heated torpedo .
one of my mentors in life was norman borlaug , my hero .
this person has never been born .
and the way in which you could think about us as a species and us as a planet had just changed so much , and it was incredibly exciting .
&quot; &quot; what does it matter ? &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; a bullet doesn &apos;t distinguish between a muslim and a christian . &quot; &quot; this small group of women , determined to bring an end to the war , and they chose to use their traditions to make a point : liberian women usually wear lots of jewelry and colorful clothing .
because although she lived across the street they came from different worlds .
you were appointed a social worker .
so we tried to come up with a program — how we could remake this structure to better accommodate ted .
this was a group of eminent economists apologizing to the queen of england when she asked the question , &quot; &quot; why did no one tell us that the crisis was coming ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) i &apos;ll never get my knighthood . i &apos;ll never get my knighthood . ( laughter ) that &apos;s not the important point . the thing you have to remember is , these are eminent economists , some of the smartest people on the planet . do you see the challenge ? ( laughter ) it &apos;s scary . my friend and mentor , tim brown of ideo , he explains that design must get big , and he &apos;s right .
so if you really care about strengthening families , you might want to talk to some liberal groups who are working on promoting educational equality , who are working on raising the minimum wage , who are working on finding ways to stop so many men from being sucked into the criminal justice system and taken out of the marriage market for their whole lives .
it &apos;s really taken off the ground .
( laughter ) sm : i actually did not want to answer this on the ted stage .
so that was the second project .
( applause ) thanks .
really the sahara forest project is a model for how we could create zero-carbon food , abundant renewable energy in some of the most water-stressed parts of the planet as well as reversing desertification in certain areas .
and the second thing , i think , is that the world needs to have people in charge of that .
we have created more wealth in the past decade than ever , but for a majority of americans , their income has fallen .
i grew up diagnosed as phobically shy , and , like at least 20 other people in a room of this size , i was a stutterer .
so basically , metabolism , which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next , has side effects .
i have some news for us creatives .
ss : a year . and why don &apos;t you tell them what happened right before you go run your race ?
it &apos;s easy to not see the forest through the trees .
with this simple tweak , the dance moves from being a dictation to a negotiation .
mrs. lois doery , whom i later came to call my surrogate mum , read me many thousands of hours onto tape .
what &apos;s unexpected about this is that it &apos;s soft , but it &apos;s also a strong magnet .
at no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler . no point .
it turns out the stratosphere has winds that are going in quite different speeds and directions in thin strata .
i can feel your noise .
you start to realize that &quot; &quot; hey , i could go to this live music event and have an utterly transforming experience that will cover my entire body with goosebumps , but it &apos;s more likely that i &apos;ll feel claustrophobic and i won &apos;t be able to get a beer .
here &apos;s their jam aisle .
christopher soghoian : so , it would be funny if it wasn &apos;t true , but , in fact , hacking team &apos;s software is being sold to governments around the world .
the chef had overcooked it .
thank you .
i &apos;ve been doing that for about 10 years .
we kind of see ourselves separate , but we &apos;re very much a part of it .
i really don &apos;t want to just say &quot; &quot; i &apos;m great , &quot; &quot; because that kind of sounds narcissistic , and then i won &apos;t have any friends .
he was about age five .
it &apos;s this crazy idea , that what seems like proof of the camel &apos;s quintessential desert nature could actually be proof of its high arctic past .
or if you take an american reference , to the u.s. capitol building and you pack 3,000 capitol buildings into that block , it would be equivalent to how large that block was .
the vast majority of interactions i see — and i see a lot , believe me — are positive , people reaching out to help or to connect or share information with each other .
but innovation isn &apos;t always incremental .
so he uses a lead that focuses on his shoulder girdle and his arm .
paralysis was an opening for him .
and as i mentioned a moment ago , the core of the capitalist system has been defined by private actors .
it was quite popularly attended .
non-mammalian animals couldn &apos;t do any of those things .
and this is the situation you see .
and we all know that &apos;s from eating too much and not exercising enough , right ?
this star is called kepler-186f .
and besides that , there &apos;s the whole problem of getting the system into the cell in the first place .
why is is this important ?
what do i get there ? &quot; &quot; we get a visual pattern of what these nine-year-olds called acceleration .
so people , for instance , just to gross you out for a second , had cesspools of human waste in their basement . like , a foot to two feet deep .
( applause ) thank you . thank you . ( applause ) thank you .
and peggy phelan reminded me that maybe my brains could be more important than my boobs .
so , here &apos;s the shot .
they have often been rejected by their families , have had bad experiences with medical care and they come to you fully prepared for you to join the long list of people who &apos;s about to disappoint them .
what does that translate to in terms of numbers of films , really ?
and what &apos;s taking place is that the beetle has got a home spot , it goes out on a convoluted path looking for food , and then when it finds food , it heads straight home . it knows exactly where its home is .
we push the pendulum back into the other direction .
what i &apos;m saying is that this is simply the best way to mitigate risk in a foraging context .
and you can not react to injustice , only to forget about it the next day , just because the rest of twitter has moved on .
and i had the usual kind that i think a lot of people had , and that is that , you know , i had expectations placed on me .
but even now , 2011 , there &apos;s still certain cells that we just can &apos;t grow from the patient .
now the brain may not look like much from the outside — a couple pounds of pinkish-gray flesh , amorphous — but the last hundred years of neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain , and to see the intricacy of what lies within .
and i could never really understand exactly what it was , or how it was informing me .
the same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves , but induce immunity against other viruses .
we have no uniform policies regarding quarantine across the united states .
i think that this will result in my surgeries with a better outcome and fewer complications . &quot; &quot; what needs to happen now is further development of our technology along with development of the instrumentation that allows us to see this sort of fluorescence in the operating room .
brad pitt : what if i told you that i wasn &apos;t getting older ...
so imagine if cloe had access to this real-time emotion stream , and she could share it with anybody she wanted to .
and here we are .
so , within six months europe became the epicenter of the money-laundering activities of the world .
namely , the extent to which you have one of these biased time perspectives .
we thought that was a good time to announce it .
there is a basic view that real value involves making things , involves labor . it involves engineering .
the reality is that covering britney is cheaper .
so had the graduate heard the right one word , maybe he would have ended up onstage — oh , i don &apos;t know — maybe with these two .
so , the history of east asia in fact , people don &apos;t think about nations and borders .
as we sail into an uncertain future , we need every form of human intelligence on the planet working together to tackle the challenges that we face as a society .
you already saw the work by tony atala on ted , but this ability to start filling things like inkjet cartridges with cells are allowing us to print skin , organs and a whole series of other body parts .
opens it up and there &apos;s a pearl necklace inside .
now , if i had to draw together all these different experiments in task shifting , and there have of course been many other examples , and try and identify what are the key lessons we can learn that makes for a successful task shifting operation , i have coined this particular acronym , sundar .
that &apos;s the inter-monsoon , the time when the monsoon changes .
and astronomers said , if the earth is moving and we look at a prominent star , let &apos;s say , sirius — well i know i &apos;m in manhattan so you guys can &apos;t see the stars , but imagine you &apos;re out in the country , imagine you chose that rural life — and we look at a star in december , we see that star against the backdrop of distant stars .
that &apos;s why i call for the &quot; &quot; chief detail officer . &quot; &quot; every corporation should have one , and every government should have a ministry of detail .
and he tells us to pay , but we don &apos;t speak english .
and that &apos;s the whole piece .
we &apos;ve started the first malaria treatment programs they &apos;ve ever had there .
dl : she saw fish , dolphins , whales , sharks , and even some sea turtles .
we say it becomes more strongly stratified .
the exciting news is that &apos;s starting to happen .
i became one of the working homeless .
and to build a human , you need three billion of them .
and we saw this guy , haibao .
you can keep sitting here with us .
and here &apos;s this incredibly simple molecule , a nitrogen and an oxygen that are stuck together , and yet these are hugely important for &#91; unclear &#93; our low blood pressure , for neurotransmission , for many , many things , but particularly cardiovascular health .
it &apos;s a story about lemonade .
it &apos;s called bot or not , and you can go and play it for yourselves .
so thanks to these amazing devices , we have been able to gather precious information about tapir reproduction and social organization which are very important pieces of the puzzle when you &apos;re trying to develop those conservation strategies .
and i got three voicemails .
sadly , a temporary weight gain can become permanent .
now , these people making these proclamations to me were not bad people .
( laughter ) and ghosn came up and said , &quot; i have the car , mr. peres ; i will build you the cars . &quot;
we &apos;ve worked on small schools , we &apos;ve funded scholarships , we &apos;ve done things in libraries .
kanzi and panbanisha are stimulated by this fun-filled environment , which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities .
e : ooooowww .
but when he died at the age of 94 , the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him .
our ways of approaching agency and authority turn inside out to reflect the reality that no one has the answers to the challenges facing citizens in this century , and everyone has the responsibility for trying and participating in finding them .
though , for a lot of people , the people who step into slavery today don &apos;t usually get kidnapped or knocked over the head .
because there &apos;s a sport , there &apos;s an activity going on that we &apos;re all aware of , that we condone .
you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s no baby in this photo , because that &apos;s not how this works , not for most working mothers .
i was 27 , and i was home from barcelona , and i was visiting my parents for christmas , and i was cooking dinner with my mother , and we were alone in the kitchen .
we are realizing that this is true .
in fact , the secret police of russia was the creator and instructor of the stasi .
that is the original slide from that year , and it has worked in lockstep obedience .
jn : it &apos;s more tangible than world peace , and it &apos;s certainly more immediate .
more broadly , it &apos;s a cryptocurrency .
let &apos;s talk dirty .
they &apos;re very polite and they don &apos;t get so forward so quickly .
and nike knows how to get your pace and distance from just that sensor .
keep to the track , to the beaten track ; memory holds all you need of the truth .
people in the center , like me , started feeling helpless .
the car is so big , the camera is so small , yet the manual for the camera is so much bigger than the car manual .
or you could actually meet my need .
just smart people moving bits . different rules .
so i had absolutely no idea how that could actually work .
so what we did , we went to alaska , which is where the grizzlies rely on really high , almost inaccessible , mountain slopes for their denning .
number two . number two . two .
i see a lot of very blank faces .
we &apos;ve got plenty of these things .
but i &apos;m teaching them to force that savings habit .
so envision what it looks like all wrapped up .
and also , that was true of the reality of trying to educate me .
the piscivorous fish , the cobia , grouper , amberjacks , those big fish , also the tuna and sharks , are going to hit by this .
so clearly there is some effect .
new technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature ; the nature of what &apos;s happening , showing us our impact on the earth .
number three , please all of the people some of the time .
what this picture suggests to us is that we &apos;ve got a radical change in the way information production and exchange is capitalized . not that it &apos;s become less capital intensive — that there &apos;s less money that &apos;s required — but that the ownership of this capital , the way the capitalization happens , is radically distributed . each of us , in these advanced economies , has one of these , or something rather like it — a computer .
the interesting thing about this climb is it &apos;s not that hard .
so we are creating dylan , which is a computational system with an ambitious goal of taking in visual inputs of the same kind that a human child would receive , and autonomously discovering : what are the objects in this visual input ?
i use it every day to measure the weight of an ox , for example .
and they text back .
they said that only 68 percent of the kids come to school on a regular basis , 100 percent of them live in poverty , only one percent of the parents participate , many of the children come from incarceration and single-parent homes , 39 percent of the students have special needs , and the state data revealed that six percent of the students were proficient in algebra , and 10 were proficient in literature .
and nick , he needs to hold vigil for the relationship .

i would do these things where i &apos;d have students become pens : there &apos;s blue pen , red pen , green pen , black pen .
i know an american researcher who travels frequently in central asia and africa , alone .
and we &apos;re pretty lucky because here in the south , we &apos;re still blessed with a relatively blank canvas that we can fill with the most fanciful adventures and incredible experiences .
well , studies show that even when we &apos;re really trying to pay attention to something — like maybe this talk — at some point , about half of us will drift off into a daydream , or have this urge to check our twitter feed .
and i carry this around as a symbol , really , of the challenge and also the hope .

so here what we did with jean-marie cabelguen is model the spinal cord circuits .
the same incredible imaginations that produced &quot; &quot; the origin of species , &quot; &quot; &quot; jane eyre &quot; and &quot; the remembrance of things past , &quot; also generated intense worries that haunted the adult lives of charles darwin , charlotte brontăť and marcel proust .

being the kind of suspicious person i am , i am outraged at that , and i &apos;m going to pause here , i &apos;m going to pause now and again and bring in different things .
bears fed on it too , and their population began to rise as well , partly also because there were more berries growing on the regenerating shrubs , and the bears reinforced the impact of the wolves by killing some of the calves of the deer .

it was designed by niemeyer in the &apos; 50s .
and with a $ 20 billion price tag , we should simply start and get to work with what we have now and what &apos;s in front of us .
am i safe ?
harmony is the suggestion of something that is embracing and universal and of eternity and of the moment .
my personal belief is that , rather than having a small , elite force of highly trained government agents here to protect us all , we &apos;re much better off having average and ordinary citizens approaching this problem as a group and seeing what we can do .
so we don &apos;t even necessarily have to have direct contact with these organisms to have a very real impact on them .
and i think some dispassionate , quantitative reasoning could really bring a great deal to the debate .
bill gates is in china working with engineers , there &apos;s 40 different companies that are working together to try to race to build the first reactor that runs on waste , that can &apos;t melt down and is cheaper than coal .
do we have any ?
i want a life that &apos;s out of the ordinary .
we started in bermuda for our test project , then moved up to halifax , working down the u.s. east coast , the caribbean sea , the panama canal , through to the galapagos , then across the pacific , and we &apos;re in the process now of working our way across the indian ocean .

keep to the track , to the beaten track ; no-one is waiting and nothing is there .
and then remember , not just one , but two .
it &apos;s what the sociologist sherry turkle calls &quot; &quot; being alone together . &quot; &quot; what we need today is an electoral culture that is about being together together , in person , in loud and passionate ways , so that instead of being &quot; &quot; eat your vegetables &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; do you duty , &quot; &quot; voting can feel more like &quot; &quot; join the club &quot; &quot; or , better yet , &quot; &quot; join the party . &quot; &quot; imagine if we had , across the country right now , in local places but nationwide , a concerted effort to revive a face-to-face set of ways to engage and electioneer : outdoor shows in which candidates and their causes are mocked and praised in broad satirical style ;

what happens when the economy recovers ?
and instead of having one school bell that goes off once , have several smaller school bells that go off in different places and different times , distribute the traffic through the corridors . &quot; &quot; it solves the same problem , but instead of spending several million pounds , you spend several hundred pounds .
what if , rather than airbnb being a $ 25 billion corporation , there was a distributed application on a blockchain , we &apos;ll call it b-airbnb , and it was essentially owned by all of the people who have a room to rent .

now there are two features of mosquito biology that really help us in this project , and that is , firstly , males don &apos;t bite .
but what if we tried to be objective about it ?
now in order to do this — and this brings this group — we have to rethink the notion of capital .
and that &apos;s that all the sensations , feelings , decisions and actions are mediated by the computer in your head called the brain .
what are some recent examples of innovations that combine creative design and technological advances in a way so profound that they will be remembered a thousand years from now ?
and it was a physiological response .
that &apos;s right .
jh : so what all of these cases have in common is that the self seems to thin out , or melt away , and it feels good , it feels really good , in a way totally unlike anything we feel in our normal lives .
it tracks your movement through space .
after telling ourselves for so long that our tools and technology can control nature , suddenly we were face-to-face with our weakness , with our lack of control , as the oil burst out of every attempt to contain it — &quot; top hats , &quot; &quot; top kills &quot; and , most memorably , the &quot; &quot; junk shot &quot; &quot; — the bright idea of firing old tires and golf balls down that hole in the world .

winston churchill came to my home of mit in 1949 , and he said , &quot; &quot; if we are to bring the broad masses of the people in every land to the table of abundance , it can only be by the tireless improvement of all of our means of technical production . &quot; &quot; abraham lincoln realized there was one other ingredient .

the problem is , if you buy a $ 40,000 incubator , and you send it off to a mid-sized village in africa , it will work great for a year or two years , and then something will go wrong and it will break , and it will remain broken forever , because you don &apos;t have a whole system of spare parts , and you don &apos;t have the on-the-ground expertise to fix this $ 40,000 piece of equipment .

the rest of the collection remains here , stored in plain brown paper bags until funds can be raised to build a permanent museum and study center .
and the question is : will it make a difference ?
and it explains the vast right-wing conspiracy that &apos;s obviously developed around these licenses , as now more than 350 million digital objects are out there , licensed freely in this way .
i &apos;m alive .
here are two of them .
have sweet dream . &quot; &quot; i didn &apos;t know what to say !
but your health decisions are the same .
so why should you care about that ?
if the higgs field were only a few times more intense , we would see atoms shrinking , neutrons decaying inside atomic nuclei , nuclei disintegrating , and hydrogen would be the only possible chemical element in the universe .
it doesn &apos;t do it with a chemical .
i visited the site many times , and everybody , kind of — you can see this from two kilometers away ; it &apos;s an exact center of the street , and the whole notion is to engage the public , to engage buildings as part of the public tissue of the city .
it was the beginning of a change .
but in my world , it &apos;s called reduced obesity and diabetes .
it can improve health and it can play a part in reducing , if not eliminating , poverty .
each sand grain is about a tenth of a millimeter in size .
so i drove . i posted a video on youtube .
they cannot feed their offspring , their children , their breast milk because of the accumulation of these toxins in their food chain , in their part of the world &apos;s ocean pyramid .
i &apos;m very happy to be here in india .
interestingly enough , other neurologic diseases which affect very different parts of the brain also show tangles of misfolded protein , which suggests that the approach might be a general one , and might be used to cure many neurologic diseases , not just alzheimer ’ s disease .
i &apos;m doing weight-bearing exercise , so that i have the muscle strength so that when i start to wither , i have more time that i can still move around .
there &apos;s a company called apex , a no-name chinese firm , who has , several times in the past year , been the number-one dvd seller in america . their average price , for last year , was 48 dollars .
thank you .

and i think it &apos;s wrong , actually .
later in burma , i came across rohingya fighters , who were barely teenagers , born and brought up in the jungle , carrying machine guns and grenade launchers .
at best , he thought , it had to have been a hallucination — a trick of the eye or the ear , perhaps , or his own mind working against him .
this is my tattoo .
notice that there are only some objects that he can see , whereas there are many more objects that you can see .
most of the globe experiences the state as repressive , as an organization that is concerned about denial of rights , about denial of justice , rather than provision of it .
in the 1960s , before marion was home to the cmu , it was home to the notorious control unit .
and i understood that could also represent the rift between one generation and the next , between people like me and my father &apos;s generation , but there &apos;s no tradition in caribbean life of memoirs or biographies .
thanks to modern technology , the government knows far too much about what happens behind closed doors .
and they also found four species of bats in there .
and look now , the first african countries here are coming in .
( laughter ) but if we rearrange this formula quickly , we can get to acceleration equals force over mass , which means that for a larger particle — a larger mass — it requires more force to change its direction .
for example , pumps , the biggest use of motors , move liquid through pipes .
( laughter ) so , a little tether coming off , it &apos;s just a control for the fur &apos;s mouth and his eyes .
the gut is actually the largest immune system , defending your body .
well the answer is , if i drew it on a normal curve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that i &apos;m trying to graph , the graphs look sort of silly .
and then the clouds came over us , and then , boom ! this massive thunderclap , and sheets of rain .
mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow , and everywhere that mary went , the lamb was sure to go .
when i finished , i went to the ituri forest for my internship .
even in newfoundland where we used to catch cod , we now have a jellyfish fishery .
this is the best you can get in hyderabad in indian education .
this stuff is produced biologically .
they have one of the highest literacy rates in latin america and in the world .
and so if we do nothing to address the digital security divide , if we do nothing to ensure that everyone in our society gets the same benefits of encryption and is equally able to protect themselves from surveillance by the state , not only will the poor and vulnerable be exposed to surveillance , but future civil rights movements may be crushed before they ever reach their full potential .
actually , this isn &apos;t as crazy an idea as it seems , and i &apos;m currently exploring it .
this is how most work today .
it reduces earth &apos;s heat radiation to space , so there &apos;s a temporary energy imbalance .
but what if i could make an instrument that could be adapted to the way i personally behave , to the way my hands work , to what i do very skillfully , perhaps , to what i don &apos;t do so skillfully ?
and together we got through the eye of the financial storm in iceland without taking any direct losses to our equity or to the funds of our clients .
for answers to these questions , it starts with individuals , and i think peer-to-peer security is the answer .
and maybe these healing zones can start growing , and possibly even overlap , and good things can happen .
i guess you won &apos;t be surprised if i tell you that pinocchio is one of my great influences .
and we go to live concerts , and we get that as much as we can .
so you really needed something on your wrist to tell you : what time is it on the earth ? what time is it on mars ?
in that moment , our scholarship can tell you that this is a bacchanal , but if we &apos;re doing our job right , and you &apos;ve checked the jargon at the front door , trust your instinct .
i had really misunderstood the technology .
thank you .
the latest effort to tame malaria started in the late 1990s .
&quot; &quot; i don &apos;t understand . soybeans ?
and if you did , you are forgiven for wondering how a nutt managed to end up in a war zone .
it &apos;s about landscape , it &apos;s about street photography , it &apos;s about color , it &apos;s about architecture , perspective , scale — and , especially , history .
please join us by working together .
now we could compute something related to this , let &apos;s say ... the gdp of spain divided by , i don &apos;t know , the — hmmm ...
you can &apos;t find oiled penguins in argentina .
( laughter ) wonderful news .
it &apos;s a shame we carry .
it &apos;s about design thinking where you have that interesting combination of the scientific method and the artistic process .
it &apos;s just one year of data , but you can see how dynamic the southern ocean is .
and this had to do with the ambitions of the leadership .
she says she first got started with 10 packets of bindis , and then wondered what she could do with 10 thousand .
but each of these three objects has value above and beyond what it can do for you based on its history .
so again , this is 2005 .
not only that , because you have this convection , you have this rising of the air where it &apos;s hot , air is drawn in .
do we want our car to perhaps be a partner , a coach , someone that can use their understanding of the situation to help us reach our potential ?
but we &apos;re going through the haystack no longer with a teaspoon but with a skip loader , because of this increase in speed .
and such skeptics can find comfort in the fourth kind of immortality story , and that is legacy , the idea that you can live on through the echo you leave in the world , like the great greek warrior achilles , who sacrificed his life fighting at troy so that he might win immortal fame .
and this , in essence , is what &apos;s known as the friendship paradox .
and it gets bored , so it will then look away at something else .
a second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream .
so i posed as a teacher and a missionary at an all-male university in pyongyang .
and it was a device that , in fact , is a model of the sky .
okay , good .
it can be music , it can be opera , it can be a theater piece , it can be film , it can be video dance .
( laughter ) so the second story that i &apos;d like to tell is , actually starts in my own house .
unfortunately the other drivers next to us were not paying as much attention .
when someone hands an object to you , you can read intention in their eyes , their face , their body language .
so this is a series i &apos;m hoping to have ready in about two or three years , under the heading of &quot; &quot; the oil party . &quot; &quot; because i think everything that we &apos;re involved in — our clothing , our cars , our roads , and everything — are directly a result .
should we worry . no , we shouldn &apos;t worry .
now , that is sufficiently zany that we would , obviously , jump to the bait , and we did .
( laughter ) but it &apos;s when you put all of these elements together — when you get the viral appeal of a great joke with a powerful punchline that &apos;s crafted from honesty and integrity , it can have a real world impact at changing a conversation .
in the developing countries of the world , this gap is even larger .
faizan peerzada and the rafi peer theatre workshop named for his father have for years promoted the performing arts in pakistan .
and none of this pin stuff would have happened if it hadn &apos;t been for saddam hussein .
( audience : once on purpose ! ) dh : how about if i try first and then decide ?
there was no road map . no one had ever done anything like this before .
and that directly connects to ideas of city-making .
of course , you couldn &apos;t have done that all alone .
( laughter ) now , that might sound pretty good , but ask yourself what would happen under our current economic and political order ?
and even though mount chimborazo isn &apos;t the tallest mountain in the andes , it &apos;s one degree away from the equator , it &apos;s riding that bulge , and so the summit of chimborazo is the farthest point on earth from the center of the earth .
there are other barriers brought about by our laws .
so we think that there is something interesting we can do here .
we can &apos;t travel everywhere .
the big point for me was not being alone and having 10 , maybe 100 people being involved — that was a big point .
and he knows when he comes home , even if it &apos;s to talk about the speech he did or the data or what he &apos;s learned , i &apos;m really interested , and i think we have a really collaborative relationship .
what the nigerian writer chinua achebe calls &quot; &quot; a balance of stories . &quot; &quot; what if my roommate knew about my nigerian publisher , muhtar bakare , a remarkable man who left his job in a bank to follow his dream and start a publishing house ?
and so , to try to persuade you of how totally amazing , excellent and relevant mathematics is , i want to give you my top three mathematically verifiable tips for love .
and then this is a film , on the lower left , that charles and ray made .
&quot; &quot; i wish i &apos;d led a life true to my dreams , and not what others expected of me . &quot; &quot; are games doing this yet ?
best of all , i &apos;m healthier , i know that i &apos;m going to live longer , and i &apos;ve even lost a little weight .
and we &apos;re surrounded by natural light and organic elements .
that &apos;s the stigma , because unfortunately , we live in a world where if you break your arm , everyone runs over to sign your cast , but if you tell people you &apos;re depressed , everyone runs the other way .
community meeting houses are places where there &apos;s very specific relationships between people , like this one in mali , where the elders gather .
it is a statement made by the current front-runner for the republican nomination for us president , donald trump .
so about 10 years of internal evaluation , testing , to get this to a state where we think it &apos;s actually ready .
of course they have to look through a bloody camera in a museum . right ? that &apos;s how museums are working today .
instead of having vaclav smil &apos;s &quot; &quot; massively fatal discontinuity &quot; &quot; of life , we can ensure the continuity of life .
and in the next couple of weeks , she &apos;s going to be among the first 200 families to move into this development .
and what &apos;s interesting is that the salamander has kept a very primitive circuit , which is very similar to the one we find in the lamprey , this primitive eel-like fish , and it looks like during evolution , new neural oscillators have been added to control the limbs , to do the leg locomotion .
and we looked in the literature , and nothing was known about this shark &apos;s vision .
ca : because everyone could see that .
so they get tired , has come dark and rain ; they get weary and tired .
but the other motivating factor is the insular nature of our country .
the wild thing about that trial also , was that it reduced new primaries , so new cancers , by 30 percent also .
i really am worried . wow , there &apos;s so much anxiety . &quot; &quot; and before we know it , right , we &apos;re anxious about feeling anxious .
you have more data .
and that &apos;s something that each and every citizen and voter needs to ask themselves .
they are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters .
make of that what you will .
this assessment , unfortunately , is far too optimistic .
i &apos;m not talking about science that takes baby steps .
and they &apos;re investing in energy .
and is that life still there ?
we &apos;ve got to engage , we &apos;ve got to educate , and we &apos;ve got to have dialogue .
it &apos;s difficult . 2011 , 2013 . freedom tower , the memorial .
if you lose a lot of weight , your brain reacts as if you were starving , and whether you started out fat or thin , your brain &apos;s response is exactly the same .
and then , in the same year , we almost lost everything .
but with this experiment , we &apos;ve confined that same mass to a much smaller volume that &apos;s 10,000 times smaller .
deworming .
i was angry , i was bitter , and all i wanted was revenge .
he &apos;s working the leg .
the rice in the cereal that many of us fed our babies was developed using this approach .
we call it omega , which is an acronym for offshore membrane enclosures for growing algae .
and that costs on average under 18 dollars a barrel .
as i had no reference point for my body , i began to ask other women about their bodies — in particular , their vaginas , because i thought vaginas were kind of important .
so we were pretty reassured by this .
it used to be very time-consuming , but now it &apos;s nothing .
cities are doing this , but not just one by one .
you guys , according to the rules , are legendary grandmasters , so congratulations .
so that means that we can have some form of self-replication .
here &apos;s one more secret for you : shaking someone &apos;s hand for six seconds dramatically raises the level of oxytocin in your bloodstream , now that &apos;s the trust hormone .
what we decided to do is first look for those ingredients for life .
every year , 60,000 people are newly diagnosed with parkinson &apos;s , and this number is only rising .
and there &apos;s a generation out there that &apos;s grown up on the internet , and they know that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to architect the systems the right way .
the typical post-conflict government is so short of money that it needs our money just to be on a life-support system .
you &apos;re going to have a busy lunchtime rush .
and very quickly , some letters started coming back .
however , although it &apos;s very , very sad this news , it &apos;s also thanks to their personal stories that we have raised awareness of how lethal this disease can be .
but what housman understood , and you hear it in the symphonies of nielsen too , was that the long , hot , silvan summers of stability of the 19th century were coming to a close , and that we were about to move into one of those terrifying periods of history when power changes .
what we &apos;re talking here is not about a sexual revolution , but a sexual evolution , learning from other parts of the world , adapting to local conditions , forging our own path , not following one blazed by another .
infection in india .
just over 30 years ago , the nations of the world assembled at alma-ata and made this iconic declaration .
now let &apos;s imagine that you were an economist in 1929 , trying to forecast future growth for the united states , not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff , not knowing that we were about to enter the greatest economic disaster certainly in the 20th century .
one of my senior colleagues told me , when i was a youngster in this profession , rather proudly , that statisticians were people who liked figures but didn &apos;t have the personality skills to become accountants . ( laughter )
and a fifth symmetry , i can rotate it by five sixths of a turn .
after all , it seems to be dull and abstract , just numbers and computations and rules to apply .
and i expected them to put a ruler next to the wall , size it up with a finger , and make an estimate of the height .
i am a hazara , and the homeland of my people is afghanistan .
what i want you all to do right now is to think of this mammal that i &apos;m going to describe to you .
after that , it had to be kneaded . it had to then go in , kind of , a mangle .
now , i found the answer very quickly .
bg : i am sure that many people here are wondering about your experience as the finance minister of greece earlier this year .
it is about our own commitment to human rights .
let &apos;s look at the next year , and you can see that that trend is continuing .
we will celebrate 218 representatives in the house and 60 senators in the united states senate who have committed to this idea of fundamental reform .
and hold it there , both of you .
what might possibly happen ?
and they &apos;d been working on furniture before .
and as that happens , the heating that we find from the sun is going to become very intense .
so if we think about an extreme weather event that might happen in some part of the world , and if that happens in a part of the world where there is good infrastructure , where there are people that are well-insured and so on , then that impact can be disruptive .
this dynamic data allows farmers to optimize use of water energy while improving quality of the products and the yields , which is a great solution for california , which faces major water shortage .
indeed , this is kind of like the sesame street game of &quot; &quot; which thing doesn &apos;t belong ? &quot; &quot; and you &apos;re right to say it &apos;s the swimming pool that doesn &apos;t belong , because the swimming pool is the only thing on this slide that &apos;s actually very dangerous .
the temperature at the surface is some 350 degrees below zero fahrenheit .
so it kind of was sending a message that only girls are supposed to cook ; boys aren &apos;t .
you were separated from your family by the state .
&quot; &quot; what is life ? &quot; &quot; is something that i think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels .
it &apos;s a natural anti-inflammatory .
we have , actually , a pretty good working definition of complexity .
that &apos;s one of the most profound insights to come out of the historical study of complex institutions like civilizations .
hey , we live in a very noxious world .
so the first question is , why do we need to even worry about a pandemic threat ?
a wise person knows when to improvise .
all those years , all those books , he never got tired of it .
if you put an anti-malarial gene drive in just 1 percent of anopheles mosquitoes , the species that transmits malaria , researchers estimate that it would spread to the entire population in a year .
now , visual thinking was a tremendous asset in my work designing cattle-handling facilities .
they would put 50 pounds of weight on their backs , and board the helicopter for an operation , and they would come back and watch a movie called &quot; &quot; bridesmaids . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) they even wore a thing called spanx , because , as they found very quickly , the uniforms made for men were big where they should be small , and small where they should be big .
this is one piece of good news .
and what we find when we do that is always the same .
now there &apos;s a project that i &apos;m initiating at the moment that i &apos;m very excited about and wanted to share with you , because it is all about changing perceptions , and , indeed , building a new level of trust .
i had frostbite in my left big toe .
my right knee was swollen up , and you could hear that ominous crunch of bone against bone .
to me the real , real solution to quality growth is figuring out the balance between two activities : exploration and exploitation .
there could be all sorts of medical interventions .
let me tell you , it has been a fantastic month for deception .
he was in the hospital for a week , shaking with chills , dehydrated and delirious , sinking into a coma as his organs failed .
but the small animals that eat insects are being eaten by larger animals , still larger animals .
human time , industrial time , tested against the time of the tides , in which these memories of a particular body , that could be any body , multiplied as in the time of mechanical reproduction , many times , placed over three square miles , a mile out to sea , disappearing , in different conditions of day and night .
just remember that single acne spot that crippled you for several days .
this is marie saylee , nine months old .
and every now and then , we do something like a , you know , an automated hair wrap machine , you know , that tangles your hair and pulls your scalp out , and — and we &apos;d make some money on that , you know . and we &apos;d give it out .
this year , i got , what i really have to say is a rather brilliant idea , to laser cut my valentines out of used christmas cards .
paul debevec : so , if we break that down into layers , here &apos;s that diffuse component we saw in the first slide .
and how many previous times do you think they &apos;ve been in prison ?
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s truly possible to express in words what it &apos;s like not to be able to communicate .
that &apos;s 3.2 billion people .
this is something i did for sony in 1996 .
it &apos;s much easier and more lucrative to market a technological fix for these gaps in health than to deal with the structural inequities that produce them .
and we try to test whether actually assisting your imagination by looking at the face of your future self can change you investment behavior .
and the good side of that is that we can be a part of the solution .
so we need to find smarter , more systems-based , innovative solutions to these problems , if we &apos;re going to start to live sustainably within this world .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether or not it means not doing all the work i assign and not getting a good grade in my courses .
people on the east coast in 1849 , when they first started to get the news , they thought , &quot; &quot; ah , this isn &apos;t real . &quot; &quot; but they keep hearing about people getting rich , and then in 1850 they still hear that . and they think it &apos;s not real .
why ? because as your attention shifts to your cell phone , you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly to the car braking in front of you , and so you &apos;re much more likely to get engaged into a car accident .
but the materiality matters too , because in every society that anthropologists have looked at , material stuff operates as a kind of language — a language of goods , a symbolic language that we use to tell each other stories — stories , for example , about how important we are .
( applause ) they also stay in their jobs 15 percent longer , by the way .
if you open any cell of the matrix , you find another 20-dimensional matrix .
there are nine billion humans coming our way .
for example , this &quot; &quot; citizens united &quot; &quot; ruling is a disaster , because it means there &apos;s like a money gun aimed at your head , and if you step out of line , if you try to reach across the aisle , there &apos;s a ton of money waiting to be given to your opponent to make everybody think that you are a terrible person through negative advertising .
but anyway , for some reason , i promised myself that i wasn &apos;t going to move , that i was going to do this thing that mummy wanted me to do .
it looks like a beautiful photograph .
( laughter ) and just as he &apos;s writing , you know , bacteria that will be smaller , he &apos;s writing genomes that will work , we could write smaller programs that would do what microsoft word does .
or , you know , vib-ribbon was not distributed here in the united states .
so then i said , &quot; &quot; nets , what do i do ? &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; why don &apos;t you send me your paintings ?
the best collaboration , of course , is with children .
my colleagues at johns hopkins were among the best .
this temporarily effectively banned autonomous weapons in the u.s. military , but that directive needs to be made permanent .
you get damaged wiring .
perhaps you &apos;ve been at home for a week on your own .
odysseus would have said , &quot; &quot; okay , let &apos;s do a dry run .
we turn on the faucet , the water comes out , we assume it &apos;s safe , and we assume that we are masters of our environment , rather than being part of it .
now , usually , when international audiences hear about that part of the world , they often just want that conflict to go away .
you can get another angle on danny &apos;s porch by going around to the south and looking north at the whole formation there .
the last component is the operating system that manages the whole network .
who i am really doesn &apos;t matter at all .
and it &apos;s been an incredible experience .
and after six months , the nerves grew in well , and you could see strong contractions .
we were the best that they could do .
decades later and dozens of countries from all around the world have launched thousands of more satellites into orbit , and the frequency of launches is only going to increase in the future , especially if you consider things like the possibility of 900-plus satellite constellations being launched .
he tried the marketing solution , which is he declared the potato as a royal vegetable , and none but the royal family could consume it .
if you google regret and tattoo , you will get 11.5 million hits .
the second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers-on .
yes , for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today , but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage , prostitution , forced labor — they have children that they don &apos;t want or they cannot feed .
it flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins , gets lift , powers its movements with a lunate tail .
and then the third part is , what are the potential problems , or the dark side of blogs as we know them ?
in a world with no systems , with chaos , everything becomes a guerilla struggle , and this predictability is not there .
it &apos;s this hair that &apos;s above the eyes , and below it , it &apos;s longer .
tr : right , so this is less than a $ 1,000 solution .
there are great things being done there , treating now autism , dementia and other conditions .
and we contrast that to the other way , an invention that happened after the second world war , suburban sprawl , clearly not compact , clearly not diverse , and it &apos;s not walkable , because so few of the streets connect , that those streets that do connect become overburdened , and you wouldn &apos;t let your kid out on them .
and for the first time , i started to think about how we made decisions .
time for some thermodynamics .
the answer is what i call &quot; &quot; ancient food miles . &quot; &quot; basically , rome had access to the sea , which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away .
so i want to talk to you about two things tonight .
and what we gain with a new technology , of course , is precision and accuracy .
the hit delivered by — david camarillo : sorry , three times is probably a little excessive there .
if you raise questions about that formulation , you really are considered a bit of an antique .
we &apos;re not even slowing down .
perhaps we are not at a stage in africa where many actors and small enterprises leads to growth through competition .
delivering the power and the bandwidth into the ocean will dramatically accelerate adaptation .
it &apos;s not something you want to put on your facebook page , right ?
so for example , we would put models under an artificial sky .
and then he had to clarify that he wasn &apos;t talking about them .
they &apos;re watching their own brain activation , and they &apos;re controlling the pathway that produces their pain .
that ended the discussion .
you know what ? six of those seven voted yes in favor of the bill , so it passed , and it passed by a vote of 47 to 32 .
especially if you breathe air , it &apos;s very hard to get from planet a to planet b , because there &apos;s no air in between . but if you breathe air — ( laughter ) — you &apos;re dead — ( laughter ) — as soon as you &apos;re off the planet , unless you have a spaceship .
and our translation of that , using a lot of the thinking built up over the 40 years , is to say , what if that , instead of being just a pipe , what if it is a lifeline ?
and when we met him he was very resistant .
it was like leaving our mark on society , to say , &quot; &quot; i was here , &quot; &quot; on the top of a building .
we believe in thinking differently .
we wanted to go tackle this problem in a very different direction .
but barbecue &apos;s interesting , because it &apos;s one of these cult foods like chili , or bouillabaisse .
because i can &apos;t explain otherwise , when i look at the figures , what &apos;s going on .
fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us .
and so we had our first meeting , after three months , in tiburon , which is just up the road from here — you know tiburon ?
so , that &apos;s how it walks . but when you look at us human being , bipedal walking , what you &apos;re doing is you &apos;re not really using a muscle to lift your leg and walk like a robot . right ?
well , the argument in &quot; &quot; the blank slate &quot; &quot; was that elite art and criticism in the 20th century , although not the arts in general , have disdained beauty , pleasure , clarity , insight and style .
designing .
and he tried to get their opinions on his patients .
europe had to be dragged into economic development .
and i figured , this has to stop .
so one of them was fairly straightforward .
not that there &apos;s a lot of competition , right ?
and we split these bridges .
in other words , the beer-maker knows also how to evoke flavor from the grains by using sprouting and malting and roasting .
let me give you an example of what i mean by harmless but taboo sexual practice . we gave them scenarios .
and the most immediate thought when i came out of that water was the following : i &apos;m never , ever going to do another cold water swim in my life again .
but no .
i was actually crying during his presentation .
&#91; &quot; &quot; yellow &quot; &quot; &#93; db : red . audience : yellow .
and here &apos;s the resulting data that comes from that , the model that comes from that .
the episode of &quot; &quot; star trek &quot; &quot; for me was james daly played methuselah — remember this one ?
and we started to realize that it could never be and never should have been us versus them .
you can take them out of the vertebrate skeleton , you can culture them in petri dishes in the laboratory , and they are dying to form cartilage .
and he admitted to me that he was perplexed by their success .
( applause )
and also , make it socially acceptable that we change our minds , or probably even reward that ?

we can inject these dyes into the bloodstream , so that when we do a new vessel and we bypass a blockage on the heart , we can see if we actually made the connection , before we close that patient back up again — something that we haven &apos;t been able to do without radiation before .
this one &apos;s mine , and i think you would really like her .
perhaps it &apos;s never been more important at any time in our lifetimes .
135 million-plus people . think about that .
ca : a lot of people look at the hedge fund industry now and are sort of ... shocked by it , by how much wealth is created there , and how much talent is going into it .
the disease was so terrifying that the president of the united states launched an extraordinary national effort to find a way to stop it .
it was the government that made law function finally .

and after a couple very liberating weekends , my wife and i , utilizing some cutting-edge erectile technology that is certainly worthy of a tedtalk someday but i won &apos;t get into it now , we noticed some familiar , if unexpected , symptoms .
what &apos;s really at stake perhaps here is not the medicine itself but a metaphor .
and then , we don &apos;t have a stuffed spinoza , but we do have a stuffed pavlov &apos;s dog , and i visited him in the museum of hygiene in st. petersburg , in russia .

almost two years ago , i was driving in my car in germany , and i turned on the radio .
it wasn &apos;t really what people needed .

it &apos;s the power of focus .
because of the earth tilting on its axis and those catastrophic climate shifts , we had to figure out how to find better food , and we had to learn — there &apos;s lucy ; that &apos;s how we all began — we had to learn how to crack open animal bones , use tools to do that , to feed on the marrow , to grow our brains more .
but watch its front legs . can you see what they are doing ?
that &apos;s what people thought .

some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin , and it went around sort of creating its little dna information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because bacteria communicate .

the climate news , i &apos;m sorry to say , is going to keep getting worse than we think , faster than we think .

but it doesn &apos;t sound so much , it &apos;s not relatively enough , it won &apos;t make a difference if you &apos;ve already committed 100,000 soldiers previously .
so what we need is something that doesn &apos;t necessarily have to have the performance of the internet , but the police department has to be able to call up the fire department even without the internet , or the hospitals have to order fuel oil .
we &apos;ve learned over time that stars have individual histories ; that is , they have birth , they have middle ages and some of them even have dramatic deaths .
it &apos;s a story about this woman , natalia rybczynski .
that never changes .
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are triumphs of the scientific method .
here is steve jobs introducing multi-touch and making a rather foreboding joke .
and so even though mars has an atmosphere , we can see it &apos;s much thinner than the earth &apos;s .
i was thinking that i shouldn &apos;t go because somebody said , if i did , it would show that i approved of the military regime there .
so one example of this that has big resonance in the policy realm is how this plays out on our very real war of ideas that we &apos;re fighting against radical groups .
( laughter ) so ...
so a lot of what we see in the mesh , and a lot of what we have in the platform that we built allows us to define , refine and scale .
we &apos;re trying to design new scenarios for space that have fully reconfigurable and self-assembly structures that can go from highly functional systems from one to another .

well , if you remember before world war ii , japan had a vision for a greater japanese co-prosperity sphere .
and every kid , you know , as a teenager , has got his bedroom he retreats to — but i wanted my door , i thought it would be cool if my door went up rather than opened , like on star trek .
it is a user-appropriate technology that has been used for humanitarian good to great effect .
and this shows that engineers , medical people , scientific people , have an obsession with solving the problems of reality , when actually most problems , once you reach a basic level of wealth in society , most problems are actually problems of perception .
orient your loop this way .
i guess people don &apos;t talk to their uber drivers .
he touches his food , it turns into gold .
people aren &apos;t close or distant .
i &apos;m connected to 80,000 people around the world , and that &apos;s four madison square gardens full of cousins .

and we can create those positive peer-to-peer relationships on and offline , we can support and educate the next generation of hackers , like myself , instead of saying , &quot; &quot; you can either be a criminal or join the nsa . &quot; &quot; that matters today .
however , we were sneaky , and we proposed more : to convert riverbanks into pedestrian pathways , and then to connect these pathways back to the city fabric , and finally to convert the urban voids along the riverbanks into public spaces that are lacking in the medina of fez .
so we have to do something that &apos;s a little bit more intelligent than doing this .
so here we can see the white represents low altitudes , and the blue are higher altitudes .
it became the media .
and what you can see here is the beginning of an industry in a test tube , a mining industry that is in harmony with nature .
we &apos;ve lots of blood vessels in there .

so returning to the droplet , again , thinking about the universe in a new way .
have a go : poem 1 : little fly / thy summer &apos;s play , / my thoughtless hand / has brush &apos;d away .
so she said to us , &quot; &quot; look , i &apos;ve been heading this department for the last two years .
so , that &apos;s just one use . incredible , there is probably 350 , 400 uses .

the plaque reads , &quot; &quot; albert einstein lived here . &quot; &quot; and i &apos;d like to end with a vignette , as it were , inspired by this image .
they find me up on the top terrace .
sp : if you let fear get to you , then you &apos;re not going to be doing your job .
( laughter ) now , if you think about that story for a moment , i think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in .
and , of course , they &apos;re basically extinct now .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about today is a device that we &apos;ve been working on that i think has the potential to make a difference , to be much more effective , and what i wanted to do is show you how it works . okay , so let me back up a little bit and show you how a normal retina works first so you can see the problem that we were trying to solve .
our goal for robotics is to unlock everyone &apos;s mental power by making the world more physically accessible to people such as myself and others like me around the globe .
now , a specific thing for this particular version of the project is that i &apos;m very interested to see how we can connect with the local population , the native population .
now , you don &apos;t find any kund ; they are all submerged .
and i think what this leads to is a very simple recognition , that there &apos;s one question in politics at the moment above all other , and it &apos;s this one : how do we make things better without spending more money ?
would the good microbes do battle with the bad microbes and help to restore their health ?
and most of all , he would teach it .
i &apos;m going to focus on scientists and engineers because i have some data on that , and i &apos;m a data person .
how can the bible be so barbaric in some places , and yet so incredibly wise in others ?
( laughter ) hello ! ( laughter )
my lady , it is my husband &apos;s child .
what they do now is : they can grow crops in the rainy season but they can &apos;t grow them in the off-season .
we cherish the opportunity to have our say , to help decide the future of the country .
but consider a same-sex couple like my friends sarah and emily .
as a result , we &apos;re tuned in to the subtlest things that could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering , in order to believe whether these things are realistic .
it &apos;s commonly reported in ukraine that children , when leaving the orphanage are targeted for human trafficking , child pornography and prostitution .
i will take enough of these . mm .
i was the kind of religious where i heard parents tell children when they &apos;re leaving on a two-year proselytizing mission that they would rather have them die than return home without honor , having sinned .
and i want you to see , this is fuku , a young female , and she is quietly playing with water .
but you get these resources together .
we are running late .
because it &apos;s only when you do that , that you can talk about — ( laughter ) — it &apos;s only when you do that , &#91; that &#93; you can talk about how we looked like and how we behaved at different times , and how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time .
before they went through the social stress test , they were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful .
as : what this scene is doing , and it did in the book , is it &apos;s fundamentally making a promise .
( laughter ) we &apos;re hardwired to become leaders of the pack .
we need , especially in technology , we need revolutionary change , not incremental change .
ss : so , then aimee makes it to the 1996 paralympics , and she &apos;s all excited . her family &apos;s coming down — it &apos;s a big deal .
and it &apos;s sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to california in the hope of getting happier .
he types &quot; &quot; opossum &quot; &quot; into this official knowledge base .
my passions are music , technology and making things .
lp : how on earth did we do that ?
we spend so much time talking past each other and not enough time talking through our disagreements , and if we can start to find compassion for one another , then we have a shot at building common ground .
people were expecting me to talk about my beloved sydney swans football team .
if estimates are correct that about one to two percent of all suicides involves the murder of another person , when suicide rates rise , as they are rising for some populations , the murder-suicide rates will rise as well .

hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery .
so we &apos;re able to do the simulation , but this is two days on a desktop .
in our fuel cells , we do it with platinum ; life does it with a very , very common iron .
another thing you can try , is switching from active communication and collaboration , which is like face-to-face stuff — tapping people on the shoulder , saying hi to them , having meetings , and replace that with more passive models of communication , using things like email and instant messaging , or collaboration products , things like that .
and that happened because this one person had a documentary instinct , which was to post a status update , which is what we all do now , so if something happens , we put our status update , or we post a photo , we post a video , and it all goes up into the cloud in a constant stream .
so we talked for a few minutes , and he said , &quot; why don &apos;t you tell them what you believe ? &quot;
fission .
eighty percent of the people in the world have no food safety net .
it extracts regions with dark contrast , which will show up on the video as red .
so that got our attention , and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with stuxnet and checked this thing out .
the moral of this story is all these narratives about rise and fall and decline tell us a lot more about psychology than they do about reality .
we cannot afford to be color blind .
( music ) on memorial day , we released &quot; &quot; the national mall , &quot; &quot; a location-aware album released exclusively as a mobile app that uses the device &apos;s built-in gps functionality to sonically map the entire park in our hometown of washington , d.c.
they bring it back and feed it to the larvae .
and we &apos;re getting this mass-manufactured .
the u.n. broadband commission has recently set targets to help broadband access in 50 percent of the developing world , compared to 20 percent today .

a nice visual composition of symmetry .
everybody likes the aquatic theory .
there &apos;s an experiment i think daniel pink refers to where you put two dogs in a box and the box has an electric floor .
but why is it so low ?
man &apos;s best friend in the fight against malaria .
since the dawn of human history , we &apos;ve tried to rectify this imbalance by making art , writing poems , singing songs , scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper , gossiping with friends . this is nothing new .
and she was like , &quot; &quot; oh , that &apos;s interesting . &quot; &quot; the guy across the street , he was a black guy .

we don &apos;t live beneath the sky . we live within it .
so the procession is moving at a stately pace down my street , and as it approaches my house , i start to wave my flag vigorously , and there is the queen mother .
and it &apos;s easy for me as well to train someone who has already passed through the experience of disability .
how do we tap into this ?
so everybody here has a lot of experience with chairs and apples and dogs , and based on this , you could see unfamiliar examples and you could guess , you could sit on the chair , you could eat the apple , the dog will bark .
it just so happens that stewart &apos;s brand of funny doesn &apos;t work unless the facts are true .
( applause )
js : again .
and you hear a rustle in the grass .
otherwise , we &apos;re going to keep pouring oil all over our mental engines and suffering the consequences .
you can feel the dynamism of this living , breathing community .
you know , a lot of medicine is very high risk .
furthermore , if we &apos;re going to really take seriously the need to ensure people share in the economic benefits , our businesses and corporations need a model of globalization that recognizes that they , too , have to take people with them .
and i wanted to let you know , a lot of the things you &apos;ve heard about australians are true .
now , to close the gap , germany has to significantly increase migration , get many more women in the workforce , increase retirement age — by the way , we just lowered it this year — and all these measures at once .
and we put them into one of these experiments , as you &apos;ve seen earlier , and then we watch lively movement that comes out .
let &apos;s have a look at this nice code that is coming from a renaissance book .
( video ) &#91; in spanish &#93; loudspeaker : what kind of city do you want ?
and so through this piano keyboard , we have the means to take a musical process and study it .
if you want to put a colored disk , well all these seven colors coalesce .
and i &apos;d like to take you there , to that morning , for just a quick video .
let me show it to you .
well , obviously not . it would be absurd if we were to engage again in the kind of operations we were engaged in , in iraq and afghanistan if we were to suddenly find ourselves in a situation in which we were imposing anything other than a democratic system .
i &apos;m going to ask that we play it at the speed i read it .
and here you see a brain scan of two children — one who had adequate nutrition , another , neglected and who was deeply malnourished .
the soil is very soft — so soft , that roots can penetrate into it easily , rapidly .
ka : i just want to thank you on behalf of new yorkers for making this happen and getting this done .
and for this one , i want to tell you a quick story .
but in fact he was the person who was most susceptible to the oxygen .
♫ marries me ♫ ♫ well , if no one marries me ♫ ♫ marries me ♫ ♫ well , if no one marries me ♫ thank you .
well , not the one we tagged !
so when wren was on the way , i realized i needed to find a space of my own .
and in that space station we have the genetic material , the chromosomes , within a nucleus .
and i didn &apos;t look like a soldier , that &apos;s for sure .
so , the new festival , it asks the audience to play an essential role in shaping the performance .
we have cells there , typically from the patient .
they &apos;re similar to things that i &apos;ve seen on volcanoes all over the world and even super-volcanoes like yellowstone .
you probably think that the force that i led was all steely-eyed commandos with big knuckle fists carrying exotic weapons .
so don &apos;t fear , this is not going to be a cooking demonstration .
so maybe , you know , there &apos;s no such thing as crazy , and being diagnosed with a mental illness doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re crazy .
we drank a lot of rice wine . we were both so drunk , i couldn &apos;t believe it .
just like a human standing upright without falling over , here we see entropica automatically balancing a pole using a cart .
should you eat organic meats or should you be eating tofu ?
ok . i think if somebody really was drowning , she &apos;d save them .
i thought in getting up to my ted wish i would try to begin by putting in perspective what i try to do and how it fits with what they try to do .
but — and this , of course , is where it becomes complicated — the facts were true , hurrah for archeology , but the interpretation was rather more complicated .
it &apos;s a complicated project .
bp : i was born old .
the key is that civil gps signals are completely open .
it makes no sense for you to fear what is outside of those covers , whether before your birth or after your death .
thank you .
they carried bayonets on their rifles .
( laughter ) and one of the thoughts that i had dealing with these two separate emergences of a book and a baby , and having this event happen so close — that my first thought , when i was still kind of in the apartment looking out at it all or walking out on the street and looking out on it just in front of our building , was that i &apos;d made a terrible miscalculation in the book that i &apos;d just written .
tourism in bilbao increased 2,500 percent after this building was completed .
we are effectively grading someone &apos;s worth to our community .
the most popular news sites don &apos;t do much better .
you &apos;re looking for something that comes and hits you .
campthree is at the base of lhotse , which is the fourth highest mountain in the world , but it &apos;s dwarfed by everest .
in the extreme ice survey , we &apos;re dedicated to bringing those two parts of human understanding together , to merging the art and science to the end of helping us understand nature and humanity &apos;s relationship with nature better .
and it &apos;s kind of the zeitgeist view at this level of the world &apos;s current mythology over the last couple of months .
he said , &quot; &quot; he was not a very careful person as a mathematician .
alice walker has said , &quot; &quot; look closely at the present you are constructing .
my wife and i adore our children .
i &apos;m saying , just do an inventory , expand your social and professional circles .
and have done experiments with about 50,000 students thus far — built , i &apos;d say , about a half dozen schools , my readers , at this point .
... i &apos;ve just ...
( laughter ) thank you .
as you see , everything starts to fade to black , and you see people going to sleep .
be a part of something .
and it felt like technology should enable magic , not kill it .
let &apos;s do something really simple .
but before i do that , let me tell you a couple of things that made this possible .
i discovered that , if i worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials , my hand really wouldn &apos;t hurt , and after having gone from a single approach to art , i ended up having an approach to creativity that completely changed my artistic horizons .
but basically , we have programs now from preschool right through university , with more and more adults starting their own roots and shoots groups .
in kenya , in august , i went to visit one of the v-day safe houses for girls , a house we opened seven years ago with an amazing woman named agnes pareyio .
in this kind of reactor , you can &apos;t do that .
you move on .
our access to digital money and our ability to freely transact is being held captive by these gatekeepers .
but the story is not about these chapters .
i mean , after all , we &apos;re not trees , and most of us are not lobsters .
and i wanted to let my imagination run wild .
what about africa &apos;s capacity to do something about these problems ?
they absolutely encouraged me to take risks , to go , to try , to try . i had an opportunity , an access to a local dance studio , and i had an enlightened teacher who allowed me to make up my own and invent my own dances , so what she did was let me make up my own ballroom and latin american dances to teach to my peers .
i &apos;m not asking people to share nicely in the sandpit .
well , that &apos;s a whole other lecture .
so , i want to see how these things have moved .
and if your employees can &apos;t tell them apart , neither can your consumers . &quot; &quot; now before we started our session this afternoon , i had a chat with gary .
( laughter ) to reiterate the point , let &apos;s go closer into iluvatar .
a foxo is a protein that we found in these little , round worms to affect lifespan , and here it affects lifespan in people .
but i &apos;m actually not here to talk about fiction .
dr : well , it &apos;s a funny thing .
i said , &quot; &quot; excuse me , if i can &apos;t do the stunts , neither can the character . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) ( applause ) this was a part that i was literally born to play they gave it to a non-palsy actress .
either it doesn &apos;t exist at all , or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or some damn fool thing , but in any case it &apos;s not part of science .
and we even went as far as asking ex-commanders of the guerrilla to fly on helicopters with microphones telling the people that used to fight with them , &quot; there is a better life out there , &quot; &quot; &quot; i &apos;m doing good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not worth it , &quot; &quot; etc .
i wanted a better education .
i &apos;ve never seen a representation of a kind of radio interference patterns , which are so ubiquitous and such an important part of our lives .
and this is the only bicyclist that i met in pasadena , so ...
i had no idea how it was possible .
my mom applied for refugee status .
these organisms , how are they insulating against their own electric charge ?
they become rarer because we fish them .
so we have an opportunity to really open up education .
cheryl was the nutrition director at high school in the community in connecticut .
what defines a story are changes , significant moments and endings .
( laughter ) is this how stupid people die ?
and over the course of the next half-year , he slowly learned to approximate the proper adult form , &quot; &quot; water . &quot; &quot; so we &apos;re going to cruise through half a year in about 40 seconds .
though it &apos;s actually true , you know , the reason i &apos;m talking to you right now is because i was born in brazil .
there &apos;s also a mission proposed for space , which hopefully will launch in the next ten years , called lisa .
what have i lost in the last decades ?
we came from two different worlds .
so we &apos;re going to have to go all-out thermonuclear response , stimulate the total cytokine cascade .
but we had to make it fairly robust , much more robust than the robots we build in our labs .
well , what then happened over the last 50 or 60 years , is that goods have become commoditized .
bia started a campaign , and we even watched her school 24 / 7 through webcam monitoring , and many months afterwards , the government changed their minds .
but the day after the apology , what happened ?
and medication didn &apos;t help him anymore .
thank you .
that was a real experience for one of my patients , and when he created his mask , he was able to let go of that haunting image .
don &apos;t put it all in the brain , but put some of the control in tuned feet , legs and even body .
shouldn &apos;t the reputation that he &apos;s personally invested on building on airbnb mean that it should travel with him from one community to another ?
by the time he was 20 , he was an options trader .
i had a sick body ; that was all .
he would know where things would fit in the sky .
that is the notion of investment .
at that time , i noticed that corruption , that grand corruption , that systematic corruption , was undermining everything we were trying to do .
a conductive pen from the lewis lab at uiuc .
you can see this work . it &apos;s on the mouth of the mersey , just outside liverpool .
we &apos;ve allowed judaism to be claimed by violently messianic west bank settlers , christianity by homophobic hypocrites and misogynistic bigots , islam by suicide bombers .
they are culturally invisible . we do not make movies about these .
so , where do we look for inspiration ? we &apos;ve still got bill clinton .
other people are going to say , &quot; &quot; this is great .
we need to get the math ; we need to get the statistics out to the american people .
my seeing her , it wasn &apos;t her , at the mailbox .
you know the words i mean ?
so , it should have happened about 480,000 years ago .
thank you very much .
and gratefully , it didn &apos;t .
and we &apos;re going to look at their saving behavior .
after i came back home , i was wandering through the grocery store , and i froze in the produce department .
ok , now let &apos;s look at these three portraits .
i might , after all , know that she wasn &apos;t a good driver .
and in some ways we had hooked ourselves back onto this idea : cells , organisms , environments , because we were now thinking about bone stem cells , we were thinking about arthritis in terms of a cellular disease .
from alternatives to battle disease so we don &apos;t need antibiotics and chemicals anymore , to automated feeders that feel when the fish are hungry , so we can save on feed and create less pollution .
that day i ended up spending nearly 60 .
he was building a machine to do mathematics , and lovelace said , &quot; &quot; you could do more than mathematics on this machine . &quot; &quot; and just as you do , everyone in this room already &apos;s got a computer on them right now , because they &apos;ve got a phone .
when we produce materials , we need to extract them from the environment , and we need a whole bunch of environmental impacts .
if i &apos;m the worst person in the world , you can hate me and move on .
first night in the nursing home unit where she had been in the same assisted living facility , moved her from one bed to another , kind of threw her , rebroke her pelvis , sent her back to the hospital that she had just come from , no one read the chart , put her on tylenol , which she is allergic to , broke out , got bedsores , basically , had heart problems , and died from the fall and the complications and the errors that were there .
that &apos;s because of the language of guns .
is matter evolvable ?
i go down into the subway — i take the subway a lot — and this piece of paper is taped to a girder .
( music ) ( video ) ( children &apos;s voices ) child &apos;s voice : there are more kids in zaatari than adults right now .
of course they must be more energy-efficient .
but the key one really is the encoder alone , because we can team up the encoder with the different transducer .
so they go down one side of the mountain , they go down another .
she took my clothes off , and then she pinned me down on the floor .
everybody says that .
a great deal of them .
the idea there behind these two pictures is that the chinese government can act above rule of law .
and perhaps more interesting , and more importantly , the question is , can you apply this model more globally outside medicine ?
because our home is the universe , and we are the universe , essentially .
if you look at the statistics , the odds are not very favorable to us .
how much worse is b than a ?
she listens , because that &apos;s what people who tell stories do first .
we could look across time at the same people — people , for example , who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia — and ask what the contribution of mothering , of genetics are , and we could isolate third variables by doing experiments on the mental illnesses .
he studied law and philosophy with guidance from mentors , but he also realized that being a lawyer involved persuading other people , so he also studied great speeches and acting .
but anyway , take a look at its pollen .
it &apos;s a plot of intensity of light over time .
ca : and that &apos;s the same with universal flu vaccine , the same kind of thing ?
and they will start to use as much as the old west are doing already .
and with that shift in thinking , we can now start to imagine new questions , new possibilities for robots that we might not have thought about otherwise .
you could apply that to the human brain in explaining some of the behaviors and the functions of the human brain as emergent phenomena : how we walk , how we talk , how we play chess , all these questions about behavior .
doctor healy then subsequently became the first female director of our national institutes of health .
thank you very much .
she &apos;s the one he &apos;s looking at , and &#91; she &apos;s &#93; the one he &apos;s coming for . can you see that ?
man 8 : okay , a12 , right there !
and so i consider myself one of these people , along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists , who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas .
and finally , we &apos;re going to put the marriott hotel and the portola plaza on the top .
what about what we want ?
and i said , &quot; &quot; you know , this is a little deep .
double click on an icon , that &apos;s a cause .
so i &apos;d help her up and take both her hands and help her walk to the kitchen .
and there are people who think that the existence of my family somehow undermines or weakens or damages their family .
famine mostly is a rural event now .
if i do it kind of right , it might move kind of like the real thing .
the scientists must insure that the ice is not contaminated .
it doesn &apos;t recognize an ironic smile , or a happy smile , or a frustrated smile .
if you see the red line , you are seeing the trail of the pigeon ; if you don &apos;t see the red line , you are the pigeon .
so whenever they &apos;d launch a big ship , they would invite some dignitary up from london on the train to make a speech , break a bottle of champagne over the bows , launch it down the slipway into the river and out to sea .
and they see what &apos;s going on .
don &apos;t medicate kids for attention deficit disorder unless it is really , really freaking bad .
but i decided no , it &apos;s a power to prevent , because that &apos;s what i learned when i was growing up .
when you take a picture with your smartphone or digital camera , there &apos;s a lot of additional information saved along in that image .
is change possible in our emotions , in our traits , in our moods ?
it &apos;s trying to get a grasp on you , on the firmware inside the human skull , so that it can recommend what movie you might want to watch next — which is a very , very difficult problem .
so it &apos;s a selfless act intended to benefit only the other .
the lancet , one of the two greatest medical journals in the world , last summer labeled this a medical emergency now .
reviews , ratings , checkmarks : these are the attestations about our identities that we cobble together today and use to lower uncertainty about who we &apos;re dealing with .
so , von neumann was already off in a theoretical cloud , doing abstract sorts of studies of how you could build reliable machines out of unreliable components .
the computer in your cellphone today is a million times cheaper , a million times smaller , a thousand times more powerful .
and now , under the spell of a technological illusion , we could ignore our fears and truly interact .
in my tradition , there is a gift that we have made to other traditions — to everybody around the world who knows the story of the &quot; &quot; good samaritan . &quot; &quot; many people think of it primarily in terms of charity , random acts of kindness .
i &apos;ve described to you the opposite of a success story .
well , what i can do now with my colleagues in computer science is we can create computer algorithms that can analyze the linguistic traces of deception .
and hofstadter wrote a book called &quot; &quot; i am a strange loop . &quot; &quot; in the course of that book , he describes a moment — just months after carol has died — he comes across her picture on the mantel , or on a bureau in his bedroom .
in these rooms , the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well , and when charlie saw this , he got really excited .
so my dream is something like this .
the dog doesn &apos;t speak english , or american , or spanish , or french .
it was essentially india being itself .
and in a place like kruger , the soaring elephant densities are a real problem .
my point is that you don &apos;t have to be neutral to talk .
and i still kept — so , in the last year i &apos;ve been spending time with heads of state and generals and tribal chiefs who all want this , and i keep saying , but this isn &apos;t the real thing .
there are applications you can get on smartphones for just a few dollars that do the same thing .
( applause ) ted is all about patterns in the clouds .
every single time , he &apos;s going to take one of these away and give the monkeys just two .
so just like personalized medicine , while you might imagine wanting to treat every patient individually , what we &apos;d like to do is build models of individual plants and then tell the farmer what kind of inputs every plant needs — the inputs in this case being water , fertilizer and pesticide .
that &apos;s one of the reasons so much of what we &apos;ve come to think of as western science and mathematics and engineering was really worked out in the first few centuries of the common era by the persians and the arabs and the turks .
oftentimes , we think that we have to relate new knowledge to prior knowledge .
no , the boy said to me — the boy said to me , &quot; it would destroy me . &quot;
if you agree with the factual analysis , but you don &apos;t feel the sense of urgency , where does that leave you ?
i don &apos;t want the poetry of the calligraphy to be broken , as it &apos;s art and you can appreciate it without knowing the meaning , as you can enjoy any music from other countries .
so how could the secret of everlasting youth actually lie within the bat genome ? does anybody want to hazard a guess over how long this bat could live for ?
that &apos;s a boeing 707 .
otherwise , go bother somebody else today .
now let me tell you , if you want to experience the visceral feeling of trusting strangers — ( laughter ) i recommend this , especially if those strangers are drunk german people . ( laughter )
they left my chest open for two weeks .
and the second is that it could be responsible for the problem of the cold chain that i &apos;ll tell you about as well .
it shows without ambiguity that there is structural change and functional change in the brain when you train the altruistic love .
so it was pretty interesting stuff .
then they had strangers , many strangers , judge the person &apos;s personality just from facebook , and what they found was those judgments of the personality were pretty much identical , highly correlated , meaning that facebook profiles really do reflect our actual personality .
these robots we &apos;re shipping every day .
and i throw this slide in — this is me , actually , two months ago — and i throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal , chambered nautilus .
they said , we &apos;ve been looking at the oceans for a long time now , and we want to tell you they &apos;re not in trouble , they &apos;re near collapse .
and the results of that are kids getting sick .
i mean , that would be a bit like asking chris columbus in 1491 , &quot; &quot; hey chris , you know , what happens if it turns out that there &apos;s a continent between here and japan , where you &apos;re sailing to , what will be the consequences for humanity if that turns out to be the case ? &quot; &quot; and i think chris would probably offer you some answer that you might not have understood , but it probably wouldn &apos;t have been right , and i think that to predict what finding e.t. &apos; s going to mean , we can &apos;t predict that either .
and after he would leave , women and girls would stay behind .
well , because we can &apos;t transport books across borders , there had to be separate versions read in all the different english-speaking countries : britain , united states , canada , australia , and new zealand all had to have separate readings of harry potter .
so what i &apos;m asking today , the question i want to explore with you today is , what kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality ?
and the pain is not the problem : it ’ s the symptom .
in between , we want to talk to people about it .
and when the book came out , i was heralded as africa &apos;s answer to frederick forsyth , which is a dubious honor at best .
why can &apos;t we wait for them to die ?
so i want to leave that as a thought with you .
i wondered how we might interface with these animals .
i know it &apos;s not an easy thing , so i admire that you can do this .
thank you .
in the second world war , too , the existence of solar radiation was demonstrated by studies of interference that was detected by the radar stations of great britain .
now if you think about it , in the age before gps and radar , that was obviously a really difficult problem .
( laughter ) and in those days , i developed an ear to identify birds just by the sound of the bangs they made against the glass .
maybe we can collect some good password data and actually advance the state of the art here .
he can &apos;t focus , but he loves walking around and getting people energized . &quot; &quot; no one said , &quot; &quot; get him a coach in speaking . &quot; &quot; they said , get me a tutor in what i suck at .
for about the five years after graduating from an upstanding liberal arts university , this was my day job .
that makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research .
by doing that , we &apos;ve been able to make a superfiber which is about 380 percent tougher , and 300 percent more elastic .
ab : no , we need to be polite about differences .
one trend that we notice in all those things is that the amount of energy per gram per second that flows through this , is actually increasing .
anybody who sees this project plan needs to immediately say , &quot; i want to do this — and there &apos;s my spot ! &quot;
and off we go .
most of them are pretty basic .
as i moved through , i achieved a very reasonable facsimile of the maltese falcon .
and this is one of the ways you can study play — is to get a 256-lead electroencephalogram .
remember , our evolutionary-conserved sequences we &apos;re using on this array allow us to detect even novel or uncharacterized viruses , because we pick what is conserved throughout evolution .
years go by , of course , and the writing , it doesn &apos;t happen instantly , as i &apos;m trying to convey it to you here at ted .
nobel prize nominee hernando de soto recognized that the key to economic liftoff for most developing countries is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land .
i &apos;m trying to say we have to combine all the systems , and with one condition : never — if you have a subway , if you have surface systems , if you have any kind of system — never compete in the same space .
recently , i flew over a crowd of thousands of people in brazil playing music by george frideric handel .
every time i sort of pushed one down , another one would pop back up again .
and then you see a date .
the sciences , to me , are manifestations of our attempt to express or share our understanding , our experience , to influence the universe external to ourselves .
so there &apos;s a certain performance level that the computer would need to get to .
they are bird-blending machines .
( applause )
gloria stuart : that was the last time titanic ever saw daylight .
but chances are the postcard image you have in your brain is one of these , the dromedary , quintessential desert creature — hangs out in sandy , hot places like the middle east and the sahara , has a big old hump on its back for storing water for those long desert treks , has big , broad feet to help it tromp over sand dunes .
we &apos;ll look at ocean warming .
now this is what you do , is you bend both these legs into a triangle , and you just wrap some tape around .
but why ?
but how would that machine then interact with reality ?
i was doing a pathetically slow speed of about 1.3 knots , and they were doing only marginally less pathetic speed of about 1.4 : it was like two snails in a mating dance .
so , let me show them to you . that &apos;s one , two three , four , five .
yeah .
it &apos;s brilliant , right ?
my solution : forget micro-entrepreneurs .
i actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier for creative experimentation , if you will , that we &apos;ve explored and begun to settle this wild land of the internet and are now just getting ready to start to build structures on it , and those structures are the new formats of storytelling that the internet will allow us to create .
bats are also threatened in the u.s.
by which this might happen .
there are other parasites that do this — which render the host sterile .
that &apos;s the smashing part of the heel on both these images , and it gets worn away . in fact , i &apos;ve seen them wear away their heel all the way to the flesh .
but at the same time , you see this video coming up here .
global citizens , innovators , business leaders , individuals , we need you .
and i held out my hand , reaching for something to believe in .
i think i was afraid that we would become inadvertent icons for the process of falling in love , a position i did not at all feel qualified for .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re changing the perception of insects .
it &apos;s a place where people have the longest disability-free life expectancy in the world .
wk : yeah . the windmill .
( applause ) number four : giant solar flares .
it &apos;s the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all .
and here &apos;s one example that &apos;s really exciting .
but i managed to do it .
well , it &apos;s not so surprising that they &apos;ve gone extinct . ( laughter ) but in fact that &apos;s not why they went extinct .
but grind it , roast it , package it , put it on a grocery store shelf , and now it &apos;ll cost five , 10 , 15 cents , when you treat it as a good .
anna deavere smith famously said that there &apos;s a literature inside of each of us , and three generations later , i was part of a project called storycorps , which set out to capture the stories of ordinary americans by setting up a soundproof booth in public spaces .
something between 20 and 25 percent of all life forms on the planet , including plants , are beetles .
why is this ? i used medical college girls .
metallic objects — albeit very small ones , a few tons at most — escaped into orbit around the earth .
( music ) in the year of my birth the nintendo entertainment system also went into development .
but i have now a message to the ladies .
here , all this food comes off this farm , and at the end of the season there is actually more soil , more fertility and more biodiversity .
but torvalds said , &quot; &quot; no , i &apos;m not going to do that . &quot; &quot; his point of view on this was very clear .
and basically , we started this because we were tired of complaining about our politicians .
as you can see , sometimes a subspecies branches off .
the same countries , the same measure of inequality , one problem after another .
one two years earlier had killed more than a million people .
an anti-sandinista guerrilla was mortally wounded as commander zero attacked a town in southern nicaragua .
so i &apos;m going to talk a little about each of them .
visitors are transient . we want people who live here , people who have ownership . &quot; &quot; and so what we &apos;re doing is making a broad array of different ways for people to actually engage with the material inside of these galleries , so you can still have a traditional gallery experience , but if you &apos;re interested , you can actually engage with any individual artwork and see the original context from where it &apos;s from , or manipulate the work itself .
they &apos;re going to work on the genomes of the passenger pigeon and the band-tailed pigeon .
i did comic book arbitrage .
and that source is design for generosity .
or is this just right for this place ?
see , some have decided a priori what kinds of changes they want to see , and only such changes can be called political reform .
einstein said this : &quot; &quot; if you can &apos;t write about a subject , in a simple way , it &apos;s because , in fact , you don &apos;t understand it . &quot; &quot; so , if you ... ( applause ) to einstein ... ( applause ) to einstein ... ( applause ) so — ah , ah , i don &apos;t have time ! — so , if you do know what you want to say — don &apos;t you ? — you are aware of what you want to say , you just have to do one thing : believe that it is possible to write in a simple way .
we know from ice core research that the transition from these cold conditions to warm conditions wasn &apos;t smooth , as you might predict from the slow increase in solar radiation .
so i think women in our society are becoming leaders , because they realize that for their future generations , it &apos;s very important to maintain our cultural identities .
and there &apos;s two things i do : when i go into a gallery , first of all , i go quite fast , and i look at everything , and i pinpoint the ones that make me slow down for some reason or other .
it &apos;s just love .
( applause ) thank you .
and i think these words really nail it : &quot; &quot; it means a society based upon the opinion of civilians .
the green ocean has the same clean air , but forms a lot of rain .
but in fact , what we &apos;ve seen is none of those were true .
( laughter ) and then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these — look like jellyfish legs , also polyurethane .
it &apos;s the number one killer of women in the united states today .
a year ago in kenya we had post-election violence .
but this phenomenal project &apos;s been happening .
thank you .
and what that means is , you are going to walk around with your own personal genome on a smart card . it will be here .
so when google was about to introduce gmail and youtube , they knew that their data storage system wasn &apos;t adequate .
and that &apos;s it , so you can just control it , wherever you want , and it &apos;s just hours of fun . and these are no longer in production , so you have real collector &apos;s items .
the age of the ocean , the tectonic plates , gives rise to a totally new phenomenon that we have heard about in this conference .
meetup is the platform , but the value here is in social infrastructure .
one is tempted to say that today &apos;s pantheon is the internet , but i actually think that &apos;s quite wrong , or at least it &apos;s only part of the story .
so , steven spielberg , eat your heart out .
so when people have started to speculate about what might have been wrong with goliath , they &apos;ve said , &quot; &quot; wait a minute , he looks and sounds an awful lot like someone who has acromegaly . &quot; &quot; and that would also explain so much of what was strange about his behavior that day .
i think it &apos;s important to promote in a more positive way on how we see ourselves .
because we need an international legal framework for robotic weapons .
design is not just for designers anymore . it &apos;s a process . it &apos;s not style .
and by sharing resources , we were able to dig deep — much deeper and longer than most media organizations allow these days , because of financial concerns .
it was developed within a two-year period and used on actual exploratory projects .
from the ease with which you swept away obstacles that no one knew could even be budged .
and i want to mention that these seals were used for stamping clay tags that were attached to bundles of goods , so it &apos;s quite likely that these tags , at least some of them , contain names of merchants .
so , natural selection will favor organisms that are more likely to cause damage .
it became the winning architecture to generate exciting new results in object recognition .
plugged me into the wires , put me to sleep , gave me the muscle relaxant .
so , by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history , selam unites us all and gives us a unique account on what makes us human .
among them there was my right-hand man , najmuddin .
the main unit will then go inside the brain .
there are four things that are critical to stopping ebola .
over the next two decades , we &apos;ll see the demand for energy rise by 40 percent , and the growth in the economy and in the population is putting increasing pressure on our land , on our water and on our forests .
and then he happened to stumble across a post about taskrabbit .
i won &apos;t go into the details of why we think the universe is like this , but it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know .
and you &apos;re not going to get comfortable before you get uncomfortable .
and you can have a hundred million of these homes , and it &apos;s great because they suck carbon .
give it a try .
we need a beautiful diversity of flowers that blooms over the entire growing season , from spring to fall .
we , all of us , are what happens when a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium evolves for so long that it begins to ask where it came from .
is it ?
so whenever you talk about africa , you have to put up this picture of the world from space , and people go , &quot; &quot; look , it &apos;s the dark continent . &quot; &quot; actually , it isn &apos;t .
they &apos;re more likely to feel intrigued when they encounter something that contradicts their expectations .
she said , &quot; &quot; who is this charles bonnet ? &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; did he have them himself ? &quot; &quot; and she said , &quot; &quot; tell all the nurses that i have charles bonnet syndrome . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) &quot; i &apos;m not crazy . i &apos;m not demented . i have charles bonnet syndrome . &quot;
it &apos;s crazy .
by last count , there were 48 different online markets that i know of .
i started thinking about this and the caviar vending machine and the art-o-mat all together , and some reason , i was one night drawing a vending machine , thinking about doing paintings of a vending machine , and the little vial of my dna was sitting there , and i saw this kind of beautiful collaboration between the strands of dna and the coils of a vending machine .
i mean , they complain about it all the time .
this is kareem &apos;s dark eyes and that &apos;s the white background that you see here .
and maybe these healing zones can sprinkle a map , little dots on a map .
in fact , this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important that i began to think about what happens with old technology .
the idea was to have — the same principal , a divided country — take cartoonists from all sides and let them do something together .
but before i go too much further into that , let me tell you a little bit about how we got started with this idea .
the waste water that leaks out is water that already now goes into that coastal environment , and the algae that leak out are biodegradable , and because they &apos;re living in waste water , they &apos;re fresh water algae , which means they can &apos;t live in salt water , so they die .
and there , in the town , he &apos;s approached by a dog who comes like this — one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries , even in america , i think , in some areas — and he &apos;s looking just terrible .
more specifically , i want you to feel like you &apos;re capable of becoming an excellent long-distance swimmer , a world-class language learner , and a tango champion .
there is a glut of film , the quality has to be raised , they need to go to the next level , but i ’ m optimistic .
people are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy .
and of course , the third motivator , one near and dear to my heart as an entrepreneur , is wealth .
( laughter ) in any case , i didn &apos;t readily claim the feminist label , even though it was all around me , because i associated it with my mom &apos;s women &apos;s groups , her swishy skirts and her shoulder pads — none of which had much cachet in the hallways of palmer high school where i was trying to be cool at the time .
don &apos;t we deserve to be saved ? don &apos;t i ?
i stopped doing surgery about six years ago and became a full-time writer , as many people know .
but it &apos;s the rideshare board , and it &apos;s basically the same thing .
and my position is that men need the very things that women have identified that they need to live the lives they say they want to live in order to live the lives that we say we want to live .
and here &apos;s another image of diarrhea .
one of my colleagues in bulgaria , nevena markova , spent about 20 years studying these profiles .
and it really is reconstructing , quite accurately , teleconferencing .
right there !
what do you have to get in order to be happy ?
in doing this , what we &apos;ve discovered is that humans are literal canaries in social exchanges .
i want you to know that there are farms out there — like bill keener in sequatchie cove farm in tennessee — whose cows do eat grass and whose pigs do roll in the mud , just like i thought .
we now know that there are many planets at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars .
in fact there is little evidence that there is any cognitive ability in a very young infant .
through haiti rewired , through build change , architecture for humanity , aidg , there is the possibility to reach out to 30,000 — 40,000 masons across the country and create a movement of proper building .
this is one of the reasons why mohammed doesn &apos;t really regret dropping out of school right after his injury .
research by catalyst and others has shown conclusively that the more gender-equal companies are , the better it is for workers , the happier their labor force is .
i just want you to name the color of the object .
they want to go in and out of all the places they are because the thing that matters most to them is control over where they put their attention .
it &apos;s the application of massive-scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture .
we will soon be using grid computing to do pretty much everything , like adjust the data and everything that goes with the data .
it &apos;s a little hard to understand that , because you can go to a costco in the united states and buy cheap fish .
so it &apos;s a really nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues , where we &apos;re asking people to make a sacrifice and they themselves don &apos;t really benefit from their own sacrifice .
we &apos;ve all trained ourselves to perform these utterly miraculous feats of memory using a set of ancient techniques , techniques invented 2,500 years ago in greece , the same techniques that cicero had used to memorize his speeches , that medieval scholars had used to memorize entire books . &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; whoa . how come i never heard of this before ? &quot; &quot; and we were standing outside the competition hall , and ed , who is a wonderful , brilliant , but somewhat eccentric english guy , says to me , &quot; &quot; josh , you &apos;re an american journalist .
21 : 00 hours , and it &apos;s just our squad going through today &apos;s events in our heads , whether we want to or not .
that &apos;s the natural cadence of a trip .
a bigger one for you to look at .
so in the last 10 years and the hope for the future , we &apos;ve seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology , a science of what makes life worth living .
if you &apos;ve had any design courses , they would teach you you can &apos;t read this .
once he stepped onto the floor and out of the bed , the pressure sensor would detect an increase in pressure caused by body weight and then wirelessly send an audible alert to the caregiver &apos;s smartphone .
on that view , consciousness doesn &apos;t dangle outside the physical world as some kind of extra .
but the good news is that we don &apos;t have to figure it out as we go along ; we have models , we have examples , like benki and sanghamitra and jianchuan .
you &apos;ve got a coil .
conscious but dazed by the blasts , you lay on your side and attempt to process what has just happened .
i totally want to go to that wedding .
it did not correlate with the poverty levels . it did not correlate .
and they are what give the word &quot; &quot; moonshot &quot; &quot; its meaning .
this idea of fireflies in a jar , for some reason , was always really exciting to me .
if i made the leap into these new technologies , then how did we — what happened before that ?
and an inorganic material would normally be really brittle , and you wouldn &apos;t be able to have that sort of strength and toughness in it .
ss : ok , ok , ok , two things .
no powerpoint is used in two days .
he didn &apos;t recommend me , by the way .
how about the people who can &apos;t do that because they have no access — the people in the midwest for example ?
and here is what we wanted to do : we wanted to make it so that sound from the world gets converted in some way so that a deaf person can understand what is being said .
in mll , it &apos;s the middle set of genes , and in aml , it &apos;s the bottom set of genes .
we just — we go like that , and we imagine that that &apos;s what deafness is about .
this is happening by itself .
( applause )
three of the original eight entities were suing each other .
and here are the results of this wonderful project that is the system in venezuela .
today , i &apos;m here to share the experience of what it &apos;s like to be the mother of someone who kills and hurts .
we consider first that life has a body .
we obtained an influenza vaccine , we applied it to our nanopatches and we applied the nanopatches to the skin , and we waited — and this is in the live animal .
but she does remember one moment .
we forgot about the entire chain around us .
people were generally aware of this , but most of them felt powerless to do anything about it — until one group of citizens , just 12 regular people , put out a call on facebook to their friends to meet in the central plaza , holding signs with a message : &quot; &quot; renuncia ya &quot; &quot; — resign already .
it &apos;s current pleasure in exchange for future pain .
and he &apos;d tell me how he &apos;s leaving his wife , and i believed him , until i got pregnant .
so i think reason is not just some neutral tool to help you get whatever you want .
now , when you &apos;re faced with a problem , you fall back on what you know , and all we really knew was design .
and so if you &apos;re looking for growth industries to get into , that &apos;s not a good one — protecting natural creatures . human population is going up ; it &apos;s going to continue for quite a while .
these are actually cells that we obtained .
we &apos;re adding life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
and then i started rubbing , very very gently , till some of the edges were quite square . and then i constructed it .
how can we know what &apos;s causing the observed warming ?
a race of advanced extraterrestrials watching our solar system from afar could confidently predict earth &apos;s final doom in another six billion years .
it &apos;s too slow .
and i succeeded .
many of them are too young to run for president , but by putting the issues out there , they are influencing the presidential race .
now , we can speculate and philosophize this , but we don &apos;t actually have to for the next hundred years .
ha : yes , i was working in a tough situation , very dangerous .
we flew into a town that had a static , outdated website and a frenetic facebook feed , trying to structure the response , and we launched our platform .
that would be very sad .
( laughter ) so you can &apos;t actually see them , but it was breathtaking , believe me . ( laughter )
we mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy .
so in my opinion , the research evidence is compelling and the logic of this is compelling .
so , all in all , in an age when the visual image of any kind was rare , tapestries were an incredibly potent form of propaganda .
sadly , it &apos;s come true . malaria , as we all know , kills approximately one million people a year .
there are 168 hours in a week .
and the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty .
this image is totally incorrect , totally incorrect .
i did that . me !
that &apos;s where all these problems come from .
everyone wants an aims center in their country .
i said , &quot; &quot; probation ? i &apos;m already on probation , that don &apos;t matter ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) it was academic probation , not criminal probation .
children dress with very colorful , colorful clothes , and it is incredible to see the power that this has in the hands of kids , in a computer . and i have to tell you that it &apos;s so easy to appreciate the impact that access to technology and connectivity can have in the lives and education of these kids .
more participation , more peer coordination , sometimes distorts outcomes and there are some things , like things , for example , in the medical profession that we want new power to get nowhere near .
we just need a time machine .
the harvard men never ask that question .
she thought my side beat up on her side way more often , that we called them brainless , gun-toting racists , and we both marveled at the labels that fit none of the people we actually know .
and i got really good at predicting how many body bags you would need for the people who were going to die in these camps .
it &apos;s a feature .
they have to try and attract pollinators to do their bidding .
it &apos;s happening .
and the reason is simple : because wind builds up the sand , gravity makes it fall .
and so it was then that i realized there was an opportunity for me to collaborate with these scientists , and so i jumped at that opportunity .
people seem to do a limited amount of strategic thinking using theory of mind .
and we &apos;ve got , as is the case around the world , about 95 percent of all loans returned .
if we ended recruitment fees for migrant workers ?
the girls are brought up to be mothers .
when i was nine years old , my mom asked me what i would want my house to look like , and i drew this fairy mushroom .
and we spent that time designing interactive prototypes for computer software and testing them with little girls .
but i knew that epidemics emerge along the fissures of our society , reflecting not only biology , but more importantly patterns of marginalization , exclusion , discrimination related to race , gender , sexuality , class and more .
in the hospital , they have to speak english .
i remember , for some reason , that they were exactly the same height .
the whole surface of it is covered with 60 million diodes , red , blue , and green , that allow you to have a high-resolution picture , visible in daylight .
the second challenge i have is that i must ask for understanding and even compassion when i talk about my son &apos;s death as a suicide .
now , we were lucky with our hand-cleaning .
like all stories , fears have characters .
through history , people have gone back into their own pasts , sometimes to a precious time in their life , to their childhood , and often , the mind gravitates in the past to a moment of shame , some sin committed , some act of selfishness , an act of omission , of shallowness , the sin of anger , the sin of self-pity , trying to be a people-pleaser , a lack of courage .
this is done entirely using , kind of , the tools that are built into second life , so the innate concept of becoming pregnant and having a baby , of course — second life is , at the platform level , at the level of the company — at linden lab — second life has no game properties to it whatsoever .
what we need to think about perhaps for mission blue is increasing the biologging capacity .
the old-fashioned lightbulbs , the incandescent bulbs — i &apos;m not going to ask for a show of hands of how many of you still have them in your homes , wasting energy every time you switch them on — change them after this — or whether we have them on the stage here at ted or not — but those old incandescent light bulbs really should have been sold as heaters .
that &apos;s what we want to see . that &apos;s why it &apos;s hard .
we can study the way that one person interacts with another person , turn the numbers up , and start to gain new insights into the boundaries of normal cognition , but more importantly , we can put people with classically defined mental illnesses , or brain damage , into these social interactions , and use these as probes of that .
i mean , really , same example : if you don &apos;t like politicians calling each other names , stop clicking on the stories about what one guy in one party called the other guy in the other party .
the next was to add mobility — so , have the screen on a mobile base .
when we think about human capital we think about the things we can measure easily — things like grades , sat &apos;s , degrees , the number of years in schooling .
that if you live in the best climate , in san diego in the united states , or in the shittiest climate , in buffalo , new york , you are going to be just as happy in either place .
and against the odds , we found a match for her , who turned out to be me .
we &apos;re kind of stuck in a loop , perhaps , and this sense of possibility from computing is something i &apos;ve been questioning for the last 10 or so years , and have looked to design , as we understand most things , and to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine .
well , you know , we should expect to see that .
but there was a pretty big problem with this .
i know , i think we should keep them as a surprise .
but what we don &apos;t have is a really good model of human psychology .
people say , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s wrong with having a conversation .
as you might know , proteins are large biological molecules that perform different functions within our body , like catalyzing metabolic reactions or responding to stimuli or replicating dna , but before a protein is expressed or produced , relevant parts of its genetic code present in the dna are copied into the messenger rna , so this messenger rna has instructions on how to build a specific protein , and potentially it can build hundreds of proteins , but the one that tells them when to build them and how many to build are micrornas .
here that same line of text wraps around a fountain in an illustration that can be turned upside down and read both ways .
so finally , i would like to say , so let &apos;s help africa walk upright and forward , then we all can be proud of our future legacy as a species .
then there &apos;s the point of embarkation , that is , the point of transition from ordinary life to being a pilgrim on a quest .
so , when the visitors come , mars walks up to the computer , starts typing &quot; &quot; hello , my name is mars . &quot; &quot; welcome to romela , the robotics mechanisms laboratory at virginia tech .
and we &apos;ve just over the last few years found out that the microbes in different parts of the body are amazingly different from one another .
i have a bunch of other inventions .
but today , the international drug control regime is starting to crumble .
is &quot; &quot; better off &quot; &quot; finding a secure job that you can count on for the rest of your life ?
and there are others who are extremely high .
because that &apos;s when implanted devices inside of people started to have networking capabilities .
you won &apos;t do that by accident ; you will do that because you are guided to do that .
you might recognize him from the previous demos .
we know that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the united states .
and it &apos;s really important you understand that for civilization to make progress , each generation has to do better than the last one .
so instead of starting little websites like the kids in palo alto do , the kids in shenzhen make new cell phones .
leading with beauty means rising above what is merely necessary .
i worked in tourism for one year in mexico , one year in egypt .
what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and creepy — obviously in an effort to drive maintenance engineers crazy , that they would not be able to figure this out quickly .
so you get to experience that in real time , right ?
i found a problem , a specific problem that actually found an error with that .
i swear to god . i mean , when you look at the box , and you sort of see how it works .
and the bubbles keep moving up there , and this is what the world looks like today .
and we have had some significant successes .
think about it : if you were sitting there in 1750 trying to figure out the big changes coming to society in the 19th , the 20th centuries , automated machines , computers , artificial intelligence , a programmable flute entertaining the parisian elite would have been as powerful a clue as anything else at the time .
then you see his left leg .
another is , you can make ngos accountable .
and so the present self can trounce all over its dreams .
if we add water , what will happen is , this swellable material is going to absorb the water , the polymer chains will move apart from each other , and the entire material is going to become bigger .
if you take the camera above , you start thinking about these numbers again .
this gives a tremendous advantage to the attacker , because the defender doesn &apos;t know who to fight back against .
how do you have safer sex , how do you use a condom regularly if there hasn &apos;t been disclosure ?
and software companies make 35 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades .
now , i don &apos;t want to create the misimpression that china &apos;s hunky-dory , on the way to some kind of superpowerdom .
i &apos;m really worried that , especially kids today , they &apos;re not going to be dealing with this down-time , that they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture , and that everything comes to them , and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it .
more than half .
and that , of course , had been a question i wanted to know .
and i know i &apos;ve performed for some of your companies or some of you have seen me elsewhere , but this is honestly one of the best audiences i &apos;ve ever experienced .
we have like 40 kids , ex-child soldiers mixed with anybody that we feel like we want to support .
and so it is not just what &apos;s happening to these people — whether they &apos;re losing weight or gaining weight , or becoming rich or becoming poor , or becoming happy or not becoming happy — that affects us ; it &apos;s also the actual architecture of the ties around us .
so now you have an evolutionary excuse .
she feels different .
india is coming on line .
and i certainly didn &apos;t do myself any favors .
it &apos;s part of our survival package , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s become so important for us , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re always listening at that level .
but also , these cultures , these indigenous cultures , are disappearing much faster than the forests themselves .
so i &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; mr. huf isn &apos;t going to be very happy when i told him his house has gone to another , into the atmosphere somewhere . &quot; &quot; so to cut the story short , i decided that i had to go back and do it .
as a frenchman , i must say that there are a lot of french intellectuals that think happiness is not at all interesting .
i asked people to anonymously share an artful secret they &apos;d never told anyone before .
again , the research shows that we prefer voices which are rich , smooth , warm , like hot chocolate .
that &apos;s what fear and anxiety does ; it causes you to be — what &apos;s called depth-first processing — to focus , not be distracted .
it goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle , then the junior non-manual , going up high to the professional occupations — doctors , lawyers , directors of larger companies .
choose to see through them .
well , that is what the us government has determined that the cost of owning a car is per mile .
but in a way , you know , it &apos;s the same if i look at you and i see a nice bright young lady with a pink top on .
the answer is : long-lived molecules , because if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage , but then the molecule is destroyed — like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis — then the damage is gone , too .
it would be easier for other people to wear the helmet and record their eyes .
and this is von neumann and morgenstern , who wrote the &quot; &quot; theory of games . &quot; &quot; all these forces came together there , in princeton .
and the next steps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years .
something was missing , you know . i mean , these are — it &apos;s kind of weird to think that someone had to do an experiment to show that , but that was what was going on at the time .
there were like 20 people there .
i actually shared that with some legislators here in the u.s.
they engage in mental time travel . they remember what happened yesterday .
so that &apos;s the good news .
please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike , or breath , is being pulled . just experience the whole journey of that sound in the same way that i wished i &apos;d experienced the whole journey of this particular conference , rather than just arriving last night .
well , in the mid- &apos; 70s , there were not great opportunities for a bioengineer like me , especially in italy , and so i decided , with some researchers from the united states and the university of florence , to start probing the murals decorated by vasari on the long walls of the hall of the 500 searching for the lost leonardo .
so if you take a deeper look at the brain , one of the things , if you look at it in cross-section , what you can see is that you can &apos;t really see a whole lot of structure there .
and so in this trailer i took it upon myself to think about travel , and escape , in an idiosyncratic sense .
i have a wonderful husband , a wonderful husband who supports me despite all the criticism he gets from the society .
you can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem , even if the problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism .
can you see here what japan did ?
in ethiopia , for example , the variation in maize prices from year to year is as much as 50 percent annually .
( applause ) so , very briefly , i &apos;ll just explain to you how this is done , because that &apos;s the more interesting part .
this is a woman who is now working at the orphanage , whose son had been adopted .
does anyone know what this is ?
and you can think of it in terms of a game-theoretic payoff matrix .
since you have to pay for the nurse anyway , the cost per immunization ends up being cheaper if you give incentives than if you don &apos;t .
i made a stacking board .
i plug in again the power to it .
( music ) ( applause )
and what &apos;s amazing is , even though we flew very high above this forest , later on in analysis , we can go in and actually experience the treetrops , leaf by leaf , branch by branch , just as the other species that live in this forest experience it along with the trees themselves .
if we can actually have a broader theory of value creation and allow us to actually admit what the state has been doing and reap something back , it might just be that in the next round , and i hope that we all hope that the next big revolution will in fact be green , that that period of growth will not only be smart , innovation-led , not only green , but also more inclusive , so that the public schools in places like silicon valley can actually also benefit from that growth , because they have not .
and with this detailed information about the real quality of life in this part of the country , imazon and other partners from government , business and civil society can work together to construct a development plan that will help really improve people &apos;s lives , while protecting that precious global asset that is the amazon rainforest .
at the end of this day i could have filled a book just with stories about law from this one teacher .
and i &apos;m convinced that those who see their world as movable nodes and links really have an edge .
she earns around 12,000 rupees .
three . five . three . five . five . ok .
this is really , in fact , a television broadcasting a show 24 / 7 called &quot; &quot; we &apos;re normal . &quot; &quot; we &apos;re normal , we &apos;re normal , we &apos;re normal , we &apos;re normal , we &apos;re normal .
and that &apos;s why you don &apos;t need to model the glass .
and that was actually an excellent business , because we provided jobs for women all around our neighborhood .
are you restricted by , say , racism , from feeling fully at home where you live ?
and there you see the tail of that great beast wrapping around me .
but i &apos;m not going to the east , because i don &apos;t know swahili .
&quot; i will be swimming around in you for the rest of your life , &quot; i told my slightly horrified sister .
we won &apos;t talk about that anymore . it &apos;s too depressing .
the 300 people below deck were doomed .
if you want to go beyond a tinkering , if you want to go beyond a hobby of robotics and really tackle the grand challenges of robotics through rigorous research we need more than that . this is where school comes in .
so here &apos;s the pitch : i think it &apos;s important that we don &apos;t just get on this freeway to icu without thinking hard about whether or not that &apos;s where we all want to end up , particularly as we become older and increasingly frail and icu has less and less and less to offer us .
and i said , well , in the same way that they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization — and then they all sort of leaned in — they let go of a protein that stops the crystallization .
here , every single student has to engage with the material .
ca : traditional wisdom is that it &apos;s pretty hard for married couples to work together .
and i think it would be important for audiences to demand more buttons on their favorite websites , buttons for example that say , &quot; &quot; if you liked this story , click here to support a cause your storyteller believes in . &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; click here to contribute to your storyteller &apos;s next big idea . &quot; &quot; often , we are committed to the platforms , but not necessarily to the storytellers themselves .
all the human intelligence put in organization design — urban structures , processing systems — what is the real goal ?
and you don &apos;t leave them where they are . you nudge them forward .
i &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re buying one military and you &apos;re operating another , and eventually it &apos;s going to hurt . it &apos;s wrong .
and this is bishop , one of our robots .
now that includes the cost of military and the cost of the fuel both .
my partner , m , who &apos;s a tech guru , hacked wordpress .
she &apos;s got a big smile . she &apos;s got a big personality .
you type in what you want , and it gives you the translation .
the courts have said over and over again , &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need any more intellectual property protection . &quot; &quot; when you look at copies like this , you wonder : how do the luxury high-end brands remain in business ?
there was no inflation .
the point is that the news media preferentially feeds us negative stories because that &apos;s what our minds pay attention to .
the perverse at heart will seek out the ambiguities , trying to create discord by pinning down meanings of their own .
i &apos;ll follow the rats . &quot; &quot; then i started going into the tunnels , which made me realize that there &apos;s a whole new dimension to the city that i never saw before and most people don &apos;t get to see .
when i talk to my students about global issues , and i listen to them in the coffee break , they always talk about &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; them . &quot; &quot; and when they come back into the lecture room i ask them , &quot; &quot; what do you mean with &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; them &quot; &quot; ?
so what should we be doing with that guy &apos;s data ?
visceral is subconscious , you &apos;re unaware of it .
i want you guys to imagine that you &apos;re a soldier running through the battlefield .
and the reason it has a fountain in the courtyard is i wanted one and i had the checkbook , so i bought one and put it there .
now , that &apos;s really tough to do with a hall that has 1,100 seats .
child : our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write .
they enter the queue , they just zip right out .
i &apos;m going to make an argument today that may seem a little bit crazy : social media and the end of gender .
i kind of woke up to this bit in the late &apos; 90s when i met this guy .
and meditation or self-inspection is one of the ways — again it &apos;s not the only one — it &apos;s one of the ways of gaining this kind of inner power .
there &apos;s an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there , experiencing the sun &apos;s demise , but any life and intelligence that exists then will be as different from us as we are from bacteria .
he would send me a fax and show me something .
the next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of jam .
everything else on there is a labor of love .
so let &apos;s take an example that we all face : chat — text messaging .
if you had told me that this smart , funny , sensitive man who adored me would one day dictate whether or not i wore makeup , how short my skirts were , where i lived , what jobs i took , who my friends were and where i spent christmas , i would have laughed at you , because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in conor at the beginning .
so go away from your comfort into a bigger , brighter thing , because that is how we will stop another ferguson from happening .
what about africa &apos;s population ? the population isn &apos;t out of proportion to its area , but africa leads the world in deaths from often preventable causes : malnutrition , simple infections and birth complications .

secondly , drug companies are not going to develop really sophisticated psychoactive drugs . we know that most mental illnesses have a biological component that can be dealt with .
and i can get really despairing . i &apos;ve spent a lot of the last few years really depressed about this , until this year , i learned something that i felt really excited about . i feel like it &apos;s really good news , and it &apos;s so shocking , i don &apos;t like saying it , because i think people won &apos;t believe me .

and i worked in the healthcare industry .
so we &apos;re starting to build a phrase .
and as you noticed , it almost looks around , &quot; &quot; where am i ? &quot; &quot; — and then walks straight to that hole and escapes .
you would agree with me that light doesn &apos;t penetrate through walls .
if i have to ask you who i am , if i have to tell you who i am , if i describe myself in terms of shows and hours of television and how globally badass my brain is , i have forgotten what the real hum is .
he said they were wrong .
and a new generation of engineers and scientists , mostly out of universities , began launching these very small , breadbox-sized satellites called cubesats .
interestingly enough , they also do this with uranium and chromium , and various other toxic metals .
it &apos;s the only spanish innovation , technologically , of the 20th century , by the way .
my parents definitely didn &apos;t think so when i told them at 19 i was quitting my job to pursue this dream career : blue skies , warm tropical beaches , and a tan that lasts all year long .
and these spines don &apos;t always drive you to make the best choices .
and meanwhile , i &apos;m burying myself in the internet looking for specialists .
she claims i have turned myself into a mausoleum , that i am a walking casket , news headlines have turned my identity into a spectacle , bruce jenner on everyone &apos;s lips while the brutality of living in this body becomes an asterisk at the bottom of equality pages .
it &apos;s easiest to see how the technology revolution and globalization are creating this sort of superstar effect in highly visible fields , like sports and entertainment .
if i project that , that would make me think that i would live until 120 if i don &apos;t crash on my motorbike .
i wanted to show you the ways , innocuous as they seem , in which we &apos;re incorporating what we &apos;ve learned about girls — their desires to experience greater emotional flexibility , and to play around with the social complexity of their lives .
we need to find ways of making it happen .
this is the ares team ; we have about 150 scientists , engineers ; where we &apos;re working with jet propulsion laboratory , goddard space flight center , ames research center and half a dozen major universities and corporations in developing this .
and so she ultimately turned to prostitution .
so i started that , and worked in his lab for a year , and found the results that i guess you &apos;d expect to find when you feed fruit flies heavy metals — that it really , really impaired the nervous system .

but today , we need to bring people and their communities back into the heart of the way we design new systems and new services , in an approach that i call &quot; &quot; relational welfare . &quot; &quot; we need to leave behind these old , transactional , unsuitable , outdated models , and we need to adopt instead the shared collective relational responses that can support a family like ella &apos;s , that can address an issue like loneliness , that can support people into work and up the skills curve in a modern labor market , that can also address challenges of education , of health care systems , and so many more of those problems that are pressing on our societies .

he &apos;s doing tricks here , dance tricks , that probably no six-year-old in history ever managed before .
so , up to this point we tried to fix it by using what i call shit-against-the-wall pharmacology , which means , well , let &apos;s just throw chemicals at it , and maybe it &apos;s going to make it work .

so wilkins said he thought it was the helix .
now the interesting thing is , reputation is the socioeconomic lubricant that makes collaborative consumption work and scale , but the sources it will be generated from , and its applications , are far bigger than this space alone .

he was on coumadin .
so , in a short period of time , we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of &quot; &quot; what is life ? &quot; &quot; we truly , you know , have modest goals of replacing the whole petrol-chemical industry — ( laughter ) ( applause ) yeah . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where can you ? — ( laughter ) become a major source of energy ...

we &apos;ve been revealing this information through technical workshops .
so i think it &apos;s actually very empowering for homeowners and businesses .
it &apos;s in the eye of the beholder .
this , no doubt , is the reason why a million people a week are gathering in cities .
the vocabulary used in those books and the style of writing .
the water then seeps over the tea .

we were chatting and it was lovely and nice , and i decided to check twitter .
it caused immense celebration in the control room .
and you see me worried and trying to protect my child , because you don &apos;t leave anyone with this kind of child , even a minister .
people were tracking their food via twitter , their kids &apos; diapers on their iphone .
and so we try to ask : what kind of school would have the teenagers fighting to get in , not fighting to stay out ?

as faizan said at the time , if we bow down to the islamists , we &apos;ll just be sitting in a dark corner .
well , this problem , this challenge , is a thing that we must now confront , and i believe that when you have this kind of disengagement , this willful ignorance , it becomes both a cause and a consequence of this concentration of opportunity of wealth and clout that i was describing a moment ago , this profound civic inequality .
and so i sold out way too young .
and when i started out , i thought that architecture was a service business and that you had to please the clients and stuff .
the central truss would expand , with the petals snapping into place .
you should be asking me the question , &quot; &quot; how in the world are we going to test this crazy , science fiction idea , stuck as we are in three dimensions ? &quot; &quot; the way we always do , by slamming together two protons — ( laughter ) hard enough that the collision reverberates into any extra-spatial dimensions that might be there , momentarily creating this hyperdimensional graviton that then snaps back into the three dimensions of the lhc and spits off two photons , two particles of light .
history may be cyclical , but we are singular .
so , i wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is , as if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole .

well , let &apos;s not get carried away .
even when we try to get rid of a technology , it &apos;s actually very hard .
so to show you what i mean , i &apos;m going to do an experiment here with you .
i have been to the mountain top , and i have seen the promised land . &quot; &quot; now , he was a preacher , but i believe the environmental movement and , in fact , the business community , government , needs to go to the top of the mountain top , and it needs to look out , and it needs to see the promised land , or the land of promise , and it needs to have a vision of a world that we all want .
still life on a rooftop , dead trees in barrels , a bench broken , dogs , excrement , sky .
the dining room looked like this .
he called it staying beginners , and wanted to make sure that we focused on those tiny little details to make them faster , easier and seamless for the new customers .
it took us only seven hours to do the first 470 kilometers of the 500 , but took four , solid hours to do the last only 30 kilometers .
it &apos;s something very personal .
and a few rise to the surface .
( applause ) so we know for our 17,000 managers across ikea that 47 percent are women today , but it &apos;s not enough , and we want to close the gap and follow it all the way through to senior management .
for bonobos and humans alike , life is not just red in tooth and claw .
we &apos;re human , that &apos;s what we do . it &apos;s one of our features .
and you can see from the arrow here indicating &quot; &quot; you are here , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m trying to sort of blend and meld these two very divergent fields of urbanism and ecology , and sort of bring them together in an exciting new way .
each morning , i ride the mini-bus number 11 .
what we rely on is not an incomplete system .
it was modern , high-tech , impressive , a huge 142-foot clear span which , not coincidentally , was exactly its height .

it goes very slowly .
and dane saw the strife that happened as a result of this .
the inside of the nanotubes is so small — the smallest ones are 0.7 nanometers — that it &apos;s basically a quantum world .
thank you .
they just use a different strategy .
and as recently as 15 years ago , there were a lot of scientists who thought these technologies wouldn &apos;t work .
that data is logged . we &apos;re logging about 500 different parameters within the data systems , about 13,000 health parameters and events to say when things are not working the way they should do , and we &apos;re sending that data back to the garage using telemetry at a rate of two to four megabits per second .
maybe because she &apos;s younger , she &apos;s like 25 , she &apos;s able to do this a little bit more easily , but the fact is that maryland voters did pass that marriage equality amendment , and in fact it was the first time that marriage equality was directly voted on and passed by the voters .
think about the kids today in the arab spring , and you see something like this that &apos;s underway .
and so , asks the economist : &quot; the first artificial organism and its consequences . &quot;
if anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades , it &apos;s most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war .
it might have been at the moment of some great , creative inspiration you might have had when you just entered this flow stage .
right now in liberia , what do you see as the main issue that troubles you ?
how come that even people who are poor very much still identify with the idea of choice , the kind of rational idea of choice which we embrace ?
growth was maybe 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 percent , but very slow growth of population and output per capita , whereas the rate of return on capital of course was not zero percent .
the problem is that — let &apos;s say she got pregnant that day , that day — nine months of pregnancy , three months of maternity leave , six months to catch your breath — fast-forward two years , more often — and as i &apos;ve seen it — women start thinking about this way earlier — when they get engaged , or married , when they start thinking about having a child , which can take a long time .
thanks .
and i want to speak a little bit , take us back about 30 years .
kbs : so , the charter of compassion starts right here . street plays , auctions , petitions . i mean , they were changing lives . it was incredible . so , how can we still stay immune ? how can we stay immune to that passion , that energy , that excitement ? i know it &apos;s obvious ,
we have approximately 10 great threads that go from 2 to 17 .
no matter how powerful , data is just a tool , and to keep that in mind , i find this device here quite useful .
a value for things with a personal touch — an autographed book , a soul-searching letter .
so this is great . it simplifies things .
and to this day , i am ambivalent , but when you have instead games like flow , there &apos;s no doubt .
that in order for people to understand the differences between the choices , they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice , and that the consequences need to be felt in a vivid sort of way , in a very concrete way .
the strongman and the human cannonballs reunited , showing off old scars , and new ones .
and aristotle ’ s law of motion was that everything goes to its natural place , which was of course , the rule of the society that aristotle lived in , and more importantly , the medieval society that , through christianity , embraced aristotle and blessed it .
there &apos;s not too much we can see .
and with all sincerity , i can say , i am glad i lived those two years of my life that way , because my goal to not suffer regrets anymore , i got there with that goal .
many of you will know the story .
how much ?
responsibility and desire just butt heads .
being solemn is easy .
the landscape is incredible .
anybody who ever gave anything to africa got a lot more back .
it &apos;s being safe in the world .
( music ) okay , and so , i think from the experience of building a lot of instruments for the laptop orchestra , and i think from the curiosity of wondering , what if we took these hopefully expressive instruments and we brought it to a lot of people , plus then a healthy bout of insanity — put those three things together — led to me actually co-founding a startup company in 2008 called smule .
no movement in the wage gap for women in the united states .
people wiggle a lot and getting these variations identified with very high accuracy , both in precision and recall , is tough because that &apos;s what it takes to get a professional coach to believe in you .
and as you can see from the visuals , the service was responding and rescuing victims from the incident locations even before the police could cordon off the incident locations and formally confirm it as a terror strike .
and conservatives tend to endorse values like loyalty , patriotism , respect for authority and moral purity more than liberals do .
so i said , extracellular matrix , which is this stuff called ecm , signals and actually tells the cells what to do .
thanks , gentlemen . ( applause ) so what have we done here ?
and that really has to do to many different challenges .
i can &apos;t actually sit with my foreign minister or my prime minister again with a smile on my face and do what i used to do gladly for them .
so the guy kind of reluctantly let us in and we sat down on the floor .
after 30 days of sleepless nights , she finally capitulated and raised the grade .
em : sure . so , in order to accelerate the advent of electric transport , and i should say that i think , actually , all modes of transport will become fully electric with the ironic exception of rockets .
so it &apos;s early days , to be upfront , but we &apos;re excited about it .
learning to be creative within the confines of our limitations is the best hope we have to transform ourselves and , collectively , transform our world .
it is in the real-world performance of the street .
it might free up some parking spots , but it will not end terrorism .
but the amazing thing about cities is they &apos;re worth so much more than it costs to build them .
nelson mandela — i take a little piece of limestone from robben island prison , where he labored for 27 years , and came out with so little bitterness , he could lead his people from the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath .
this is what you look like . this is one of your chromosomes .
in fact , it is a business that has grown threefold over the past 15 years .
and schrodinger said the essence was information present in our chromosomes , and it had to be present on a molecule . i &apos;d never really thought of molecules before .
and you were supposed to think , well , the state legislature was rural-controlled , and they hated the big city , so rather than putting the capital in a big city , they put it in a county seat .
he said , &quot; &quot; everything i &apos;ve been telling you for the last 20 years , forget about it . it was wrong .
in fact , i loved the movie , how they duplicated all my projects .
it &apos;s comprised of ideas and narratives and symbols and leaders .
on dry days , some colonies forage less , so colonies are different in how they manage this trade-off between spending water to search for seeds and getting water back in the form of seeds .
one of my closest friends , okoloma , died in a plane crash because our fire trucks did not have water .
we have major challenges , you can imagine , to finish this job , but as you &apos;ve also seen , it &apos;s doable , it has great secondary benefits , and polio eradication is a great buy .
and he pointed to the busloads of tourists that would show up everyday , with cameras ready usually .
so why don &apos;t you give them a little history — just a tickle — a bit of history of where it comes from .
for my part , what i wanted us to do was just to look at terrorism as though it was a global brand , say , coca-cola .
you have to think about things like pause points .
wk : in fact , a design of the windmill that was in the book , it has got four — ah — three blades , and mine has got four blades .
thank you very much .
the most severe headaches responded better after we did it several times , and the unexpected finding indicates that even established headaches , not only those with aura , get treated and get diminished .
so there &apos;s a place for math and physics and all that there .
and she said , &quot; &quot; well , you don &apos;t have to do that again . &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; and then she said , &quot; &quot; but how does it happen when a man and woman are together ?
i mean , my all-time classic is another &quot; &quot; come here &quot; &quot; one .
they &apos;ve said it &apos;s just metadata , it &apos;s just metadata , and they &apos;re talking about a specific legal authority called section 215 of the patriot act .
in weather , the feelings assume the physical characteristics of the weather that they represent , so that the ones collected on a sunny day swirl around as if they &apos;re part of the sun .
what did you like best about being in congress ?
and what they found is that they think that we know of about nine percent of the species in the ocean .
is it going to land where it &apos;s supposed to ?
the second is , do blogs genuinely have the possibility of accessing a kind of collective intelligence that has previously remained , for the most part , untapped ?
if you can plan it like a project , you can plan what resources you need and you can execute it , exactly like a project .
not every asylum seeker is lucky like me .
but everybody agreed to play a game where the worst sketch artist bought the next round of drinks .

ak : so in 1981 , i persuaded basil and some friends of mine to form a puppet company .
that personal experience with the use of race in genetic testing got me thinking : where else in medicine is race used to make false biological predictions ?
regret doesn &apos;t remind us that we did badly .
the overall time that we have for our narrative , our lifespan , has been increasing , but the smallest measure , the moment , has shrunk .
( laughter ) there &apos;s very few times you &apos;d be happy to find this on your car , but it did seem to indicate that we were coming back .
he said that he was in agony and wanted to get a gun so he could end his life .
imagine , for example , you &apos;re the captain of a cruise ship trying to make your way through a thick fog and some passenger in the back turns on a wave bubble .
and maybe i even want to interview him first , because there are more people who refer to him .
it will stop because of the growing demand of us on all the resources , all the capacity , all the systems of the earth , which is now having economic damage .
here every gesture needs intention , is alive with consciousness .
the most venomous animal that lives in the ocean is the box jellyfish .
we have to look over generations to understand it .
what if the bombs are just simply wake-up calls for us ?
he was actually living in the kibera slums when his father called him and told him about artemisia and the value-add potential .
or we &apos;re , &quot; &quot; oh , yeah , this party , let me take a picture . &quot; &quot; but we rarely do that when we &apos;re having a bad day , and something horrible is happening .
dh : we will juggle seven .
you look at that lane on the right .
we have to find a way to meet our needs , while making of this place an eden .
now , instead of crude tools made of sticks and stones , israel now had iron plows , and sickles , and hoes and military weapons .
people who are good are at the top , bad at the bottom .
but when that food is there , it &apos;s transformative .
( laughter ) so when that happens — this works in keynote , powerpoint , it works in every program — all you do is hit the letter b key , b for blackout , to black out the slide , make everybody look at you , and then when you &apos;re ready to go on , you hit b again , and if you &apos;re really on a roll , you can hit the w key for &quot; &quot; whiteout , &quot; &quot; and you white out the slide , and then you can hit w again to un-blank it .
our pact with our patients , the hippocratic oath and its variants , is about the sanctity of the patient-doctor relationship .
the actors were right there in front of us , right there among the commuters , and we could hear them , but we might not have otherwise seen them .
some of them are about the animals , the number .
every man deserves the opportunity to grow a little bit of luxury .
film , it &apos;s an incredible medium , but essentially , it &apos;s the same now as it was then .
and this was something that was really brought home to me a year ago when i found out i was pregnant and the first scan revealed that my baby had a birth defect associated with exposure to estrogenic chemicals in the womb and the second scan revealed no heartbeat .
second one : can you light a little torch-bulb with a battery bulb and one piece of wire ?
i can remember speaking to a 12-year-old boy , a football player , and i asked him , i said , &quot; &quot; how would you feel if , in front of all the players , your coach told you you were playing like a girl ? &quot; &quot; now i expected him to say something like , i &apos;d be sad ; i &apos;d be mad ; i &apos;d be angry , or something like that .
but if compassion was fun , everybody &apos;s going to do it .
but help was on the way , and shortly afterwards a car arrived from the swiss embassy .
what do you fear ?
two hundred years ago , the united states was less than a few percent urbanized .
and finally , in the shade under the mirrors , it &apos;s possible to grow all sorts of crops that would not grow in direct sunlight .
putting all the data together , what we found is that , contrary to popular opinion , looting did not start to get worse in egypt in 2011 after the arab spring , but in 2009 , after the global recession .
and we came up with econol .
and as we like to say — and i know there are a lot of americans in the audience here — if americans want to live the american dream , they should go to denmark .
could we get the balloon to talk directly to handsets , so that we didn &apos;t need the antenna as an intermediary receiver ?
and then we had this one event that stays in my heart forever where a basketball coach was talking to a room filled with male athletes and men from all walks of life .
it &apos;s really difficult . so we &apos;re still having to rely on illegitimate ways of getting information , through leaks .
serena , a 32-year-old accountant , says that it &apos;s important to her for her doctor to share her values when it comes to reproductive choice and women &apos;s rights .
it took many millions of years before these bright lights evolved into a smart communication tool that could be used not just to ward off potential predators but to bring in potential mates .
now when this works , it &apos;s because there are large institutions underwriting every 1 or 0 that changes on a computer .
on the left-hand panel , again , we have the s-shaped curve of adoption .
we must ban the deployment and development of killer robots .
durga , resplendent , bedecked , beautiful , her 18 arms ready for warfare , as she rode astride her lion into the battlefield to destroy mahishasur .
bc : edl is this immense , technically challenging problem .
put your book beneath it and you can read .
we &apos;re going to talk — my — a new lecture , just for ted — and i &apos;m going show you some illusions that we &apos;ve created for ted , and i &apos;m going to try to relate this to happiness . what i was thinking about with happiness is , what gives happiness — or happiness , which i equate with joy in my particular area , and i think there &apos;s something very fundamental . and i was thinking about this . and it &apos;s in terms of both illusions and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows is that there &apos;s something about these things where our expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing
the first is cloning .
the current king of the romantics , who approaches his work in a very different fashion .
a part of me had become alienated from myself .
so , i &apos;m swimming along , and it takes off my leg .
so thousands and thousands of people have taken this test online , so we have results .
it &apos;s not as if i had any idea what it would look like , but there was a sense that we would have to do something with new categories of workers and something having to do with behavior change and something having to do with public education .
but if i ask them , is the ted website going to go down ?
what picasso did , for example , was take the concept &quot; &quot; western art &quot; &quot; and the concept &quot; &quot; african masks &quot; &quot; and blend them together — not only the geometry , but the moral systems entailed in them .
so now , what i &apos;ve been working on for the last four years is to develop smart biomaterials , which are actually materials that will work with the body , helping it to heal and helping it to allow the wounds to heal normally .
and six months later , we sat down at kennedy space center .
and when we talked to her , she said that when she was undergoing chemotherapy , she had to go to the hospital every month for her infusions .
so , now we have , immediately , a real-time map showing where there are refugee camps — rapidly became the best map to use if you &apos;re doing relief work in port-au-prince .
here , let me give you an analogy .
so , the electromagnetic force , the force that holds us together , gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures .
thank you .
now , we have lots of people who are doing this already , and we &apos;ve talked a little bit about the educational side .
they said , &quot; &quot; every day we have patients that come into the clinic — child has an ear infection , i prescribe antibiotics .
so the question becomes , what drives men &apos;s support for women &apos;s rights ?
most of the kids i was seeing had experienced such severe trauma that it felt like something else was going on .
trickster is a change agent .
men were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women , that &apos;s essentially what it is .
so we have had tremendous success , and we kind of got caught up in our own success quite a bit , and we started using expressions like &quot; &quot; lifesaving . &quot; &quot; i really apologize to everybody for doing that , because obviously , we don &apos;t .
studies show that antioxidants are known to decrease these heterocyclic amines .
now lol , we generally think of as meaning &quot; &quot; laughing out loud . &quot; &quot; and of course , theoretically , it does , and if you look at older texts , then people used it to actually indicate laughing out loud .
but the mother lode of discoveries on enceladus was found at the south pole — and we &apos;re looking at the south pole here — where we found this system of fractures .
so i started cold-calling , and eventually got through to sue savage-rumbaugh , and she invited me down .
now the viability threshold is reached , and the frequency distribution has dramatically changed and , in fact , stabilizes .
anyway — sorry .
&quot; look closely at the most embarrassing details . amplify them . &quot;
this is mass general in boston .
the real way that i became a model is i won a genetic lottery , and i am the recipient of a legacy , and maybe you &apos;re wondering what is a legacy .
so it &apos;s not all bad news . i mean , there definitely is progress on the line , but i think what we find is that the closer that we get right into the heart of power , the more opaque , closed it becomes .
if i know when i was young , that &#91; by &#93; killing an elephant , i &apos;m destroying biodiversity , i would not have done it .
and i will go you one further .
i had to do something .
and that &apos;s felony murder — 25 to life , parole at 50 if you &apos;re lucky , and tony &apos;s not feeling very lucky .
and &#91; with &#93; that you will get two extra , but that won &apos;t change the energy use very much .
and one of the ways that you can think about repairing your fracture is this procedure here , called an iliac crest harvest .

jh : give me a story of a tool you created at the beginning in second life that you were pretty sure people would want to use in the creation of their avatars or in communicating that people actually in practice said , no , i &apos;m not interested in that at all , and name something that you didn &apos;t come up with that almost immediately people began to demand .
you can say &quot; &quot; weather , &quot; &quot; and the name of the city you &apos;re going to travel to .
but i &apos;ll ask you guys to stand up so we celebrate the life of a british aid worker called emma mccune that made it possible for me to be here .
maybe they are the lucky ones .
green is the sort of cool areas where it &apos;s not turned on .
well , what did we do ? we said , we can make a website , we can make an expert network , a social network , that would connect the network to the institution to allow scientists and technologists to get better information to the patent office to aid in making those decisions .
and then we founded a mission-driven company , and we &apos;re developing kits to make it easier for anyone with a sink and a soldering iron to make these things at home .
i mean , but we don &apos;t have a concept of that .
it &apos;s called batting average .
experimentally , this is what we &apos;ve done in the last year .
and we ask them questions that are actually not really answerable , the types of questions that 9 / 11 itself draws forth for all of us .
in other words , if you put onto the roads , as is currently happening , 1,000 new cars every day — statistically , it &apos;s the biggest booming auto market in the world — and the half a billion bicycles serving one and a third billion people are reducing .
&quot; there is no justice in the world . there is some justice in the world . the world is just . &quot;
( applause )
the first words of whole earth discipline are , &quot; &quot; we are as gods , and have to get good at it . &quot; &quot; thank you .
and the idea was to create some self-moving benches in the main exhibition room .
this is an area today that has very few regulations and even fewer rules .
rng : so , do you think it &apos;s human nature that &apos;s changed ?
now unlike a human-designed computer , where there &apos;s a fairly small number of different parts — we know how they work , because we humans designed them — the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells , maybe tens of thousands .
if nothing else , you realize very quickly as a teenager , it is not a hit with girls to know captain kirk &apos;s middle name .
the passion with which we &apos;ve been singing the national anthem since we were kids .
they just want you to tell us what you &apos;re feeling , what you &apos;re thinking , and get into the solution .
it was beyond the technology of the day to depict a man aging backwards .
when things were so intense , when cnn international was broadcasting live from istanbul , cnn turkey instead was broadcasting a documentary on penguins .
that &apos;s what we do .
something &apos;s gotta be working up there .
we &apos;re near the end , we &apos;re getting close to the world series .
could we start to share our intelligence ?
and i think we &apos;re almost there .
and we &apos;re taking these films , and we &apos;re showing them at the united nations to people that work there and people that are visiting there .
this purchase included mining and hunting rights , ownership of all land on the island , and a castle with no furniture included .
they folded samosas for our entire mosque .
the second component might be the stomach .
so we see again , climate change is large : nairobi , global conference , environmental .
that is a public act of making media .
and these are some of the cells that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy .
it &apos;s 10 by 10 by 30 centimeters , it weighs four kilograms , and we &apos;ve stuffed the latest and greatest electronics and sensor systems into this little package so that even though this is really small , this can take pictures 10 times the resolution of the big satellite here , even though it weighs one thousandth of the mass .
&#91; &quot; &quot; you &apos;re welcome &quot; &quot; &#93; ( laughter ) ( applause )
world war ii changed a lot of things , and one of them was this need to protect people from becoming victims of medical research without informed consent .
instead , they use tools like skype , which they think are immune to interception .
alive .
and this is the idea that science magazine used on their front cover .
this kogi doesn &apos;t exist . it &apos;s a moving truck . right ?
it &apos;s a fantastic example , a simple object .
then the nest maintenance workers work inside the nest , and i wanted to say that the nests look a lot like bill lishman &apos;s house .
it has to be investing in low-carbon technologies and infrastructures .
now why are people using it ?
we made it learn from us , and we set it free in the desert .
there were other people in the room .
they are the most remarkable animals i &apos;ve ever worked with , and the same with polar bears .
glenn greenwald : you know , i think one of the things that happens is that people &apos;s courage in this regard gets contagious , and so although i and the other journalists with whom i was working were certainly aware of the risk — the united states continues to be the most powerful country in the world and doesn &apos;t appreciate it when you disclose thousands of their secrets on the internet at will — seeing somebody who is a 29-year-old ordinary person who grew up in a very ordinary environment exercise the degree of principled courage that edward snowden risked , knowing that he was going to go to prison for the rest of his life
in one case , i flew all the way to malaga with a team because the thing was signed with seals and various very official seals from the city , and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port .
it is the team , and it &apos;s also the community that uses this technology in ways that we could not foresee .
and here you have the types of explanations that they provide for some of their actions .
it works like this : you take a brain , or parts of that brain , and you dissolve it in detergent , which destroys the cell membranes but keeps the cell nuclei intact , so you end up with a suspension of free nuclei that looks like this , like a clear soup .
our poetry is our mutation , our life .
do you have any worries about that industry , and perhaps the financial industry in general ?
( applause ) play video one .
they were amazing — like you can see here .
who would ever have thought you could have your own eeg at your home , tagged to a very nice alarm clock , by the way ?
final story , we also built a computer .
the high speed was 16 kilocycles .
here &apos;s a site which allows you to look at recovery spending in california .
but they asked one question . they said , &quot; &quot; is this repeatable ? &quot; &quot; that was a fair question because my memoir was simply how i found solutions that worked for me .
if you take all the nuclear waste we &apos;ve ever made in the united states , put it on a football field , stacked it up , it would only reach 20 feet high .
now i can tell you , in my own industry , at ariel investments , we actually view our diversity as a competitive advantage , and that advantage can extend way beyond business .
most of what &apos;s extracted from our end-of-life stuff , if it makes it to a recycler , are the metals .
well if you get the kiss now , it &apos;s over and done with .
a year and a half ago , four of the five people who are full time members at ushahidi , which means &quot; &quot; testimony &quot; &quot; in swahili , were ted fellows .
and this really shows that the spinal cord is a very sophisticated locomotion controller .
that is not just an abstract proposition .
and the thing about it is that we have well and truly proven the nanopatch within the laboratory setting .
so here &apos;s an example : one recent study took two groups of agnostics , that is people who are undecided in their religious beliefs .
that it is amazing that connection we can have with what &apos;s there .
we have no written record . well , actually , we do .
so you have to keep on top of the business .
he was caught by dedicated , resourceful , brilliant people in partnerships with various technologies .
you &apos;re helping him discover the garden by just pointing out these snails .
they &apos;re hidden in plain sight .
and i have done this throughout my work .
take 59 away from 60 , and you ’ re left with the one .
why not helen mirren ? she &apos;s a great actor . why not ? &quot; &quot; and this material really did work for a woman equally as well .
when they were interviewed after the study , all the participants said that they firmly believed that the learning and punishment study served a worthy scientific purpose which would have enduring gains for science as opposed to the momentary nonfatal discomfort caused to the participants .
we believe in risk awareness .
now , i showed this to a physicist friend of mine who has a profound distaste for biology , and he says , &quot; &quot; that ’ s easy ! the things are a different color ! &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) we have to go a little beyond that . now let me explain why vibrational theory has some sort of interest in it . these molecules , as you saw in the beginning , the building blocks had springs connecting them to each other .
bj : and of course , through the night , they lay together .
but you know , sort of &quot; &quot; our brains have been manipulated ; we &apos;re all addicts . &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; addiction &quot; &quot; is thrown around .
and we &apos;re now , with satellite dishes , pulling and analyzing a good part of all the tv being watched in the united states .
thank you for joining us .
and yet , how did it start ?
and one of the things we tend to do as adults , again , is we edit things .
as a kid , i was fascinated with all things air and space .
we do have to see this as a deadly battlefield .
and this was an inspiration to me .
open defecation is rampant .
they even called it &quot; &quot; he &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; she , &quot; &quot; whereas people with the calculated brain called it &quot; &quot; it , &quot; &quot; and nobody ever called it &quot; &quot; he &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; she . &quot; &quot; when they talked about it after the task , with the adventurous brain , they said , &quot; &quot; by the end , we were good friends and high-fived mentally . &quot; &quot; whatever that means .
well , steve noticed that and he said , &quot; we &apos;re not going to let that happen to our product . &quot;
since it &apos;s organic , i &apos;m really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals .
but not as the guy on the table ; the guy doing open-heart surgery .
and , perhaps most important , as teachers , we should strive to be the ordinary heroes , the moral exemplars , to the people we mentor .
they said that is the dumbest thing you &apos;ve ever said .
no ? now ?
ordinarily , the pendulum would just swing back into the other direction .
they &apos;re psychiatrists .
that &apos;s what happened to me when i noticed that we are moving from passive consumers to creators , to highly enabled collaborators .
and then the next light bulb was , better than just writing , what about film and tv , to get out to people in a big way ?
by the time the next election comes , i believe every candidate will have to disclose where they stand on the abolition of fossil fuels .
a space that doesn &apos;t always follow us like a dog that has been trained to follow us , but moves ahead into directions of demonstrating other possibilities , other experiences , that have never been part of the vocabulary of architecture .
so this is mr. perry . he &apos;s the assistant superintendent .
there was an article which was run by ap , on the wire .
text messaging : that was originally designed for people who are deaf .
so , that &apos;s very intuitive , and that &apos;s what we want .
if we could do that , this could be extremely powerful .
democracy matters because it reflects an idea of equality and an idea of liberty . it reflects an idea of dignity , the dignity of the individual , the idea that each individual should have an equal vote , an equal say , in the formation of their government .
suppose that two american friends are traveling together in italy .
this is the situation in qatar , for those who don &apos;t know .
( applause ) i was trying to think of the right model to describe this form of random acts of kindness by geeky strangers .
now what about goals ? where are we going toward ?
maria was in a car accident , and she woke up on her 16th birthday to the news that she was a complete quadriplegic , had no movement from the neck down , had damage to her vocal chords , and she couldn &apos;t talk .
all right . so , like all good stories , this starts a long , long time ago when there was basically nothing .
lidia yuknavitch : i &apos;m making a confession : i stole three linen napkins — ( laughter ) from three different restaurants .
it &apos;s called retro-vaccinology , and its implications extend way beyond that of just hiv .
tr : ninety-nine . well , that &apos;s an improvement .
so we tried to come up with a way , as a group , to have a kind of design swat team .
so the best that our little savings accounts or retirement accounts can do is to try to catch some waves in the good cycles and hope that we don &apos;t get inundated in the turbulent ones , but certainly our decisions on how to steer our little retirement accounts don &apos;t affect the tides , don &apos;t change the shape or size or direction of the waves .
so we began with a card table in the clinic waiting room — totally lemonade stand style .
but he &apos;s about to dispel the gloom by using those bright colors right underneath noah : emerald , topaz , scarlet on the prophet zechariah .
your pupils dilate , your muscles contract , your spidey sense tingles , basically your whole body is trigger-happy . ( laughter ) that condition is not conducive to performing folk music . ( laughter )
he said , that &apos;s what flutes are for — to be played well .
now , if we do that , if we put the resources and the focus to it , what does it actually cost to get people out of slavery ?
this , of course , is not true for the students who graduate from the top institutions , but for many others , they do not get the value for their time and their effort .
i met women running essential oils businesses , wineries and even the country &apos;s largest advertising agency .
let &apos;s look at some videos of what happened when we tested these new drugs in worms .
africa has been good to us ; it is time for us to give back to africa .
( english ) omer my brother , i will always love you .
we was so , so stupid . the most stupid bacteria .
but in gay men , you &apos;ve got quite a dramatic rise starting three or four years after treatment became widely available .
but in the last few decades that has totally changed .
except for my son , who said , &quot; &quot; well , he could have two dads . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) ( applause ) that &apos;s an index , an indicator of how things have changed .
somebody get the front legs .
and what do we teach in these schools ?
i study how the brain processes information . that is , how it takes information in from the outside world , and converts it into patterns of electrical activity , and then how it uses those patterns to allow you to do things — to see , hear , to reach for an object .
so it was pretty obvious after this process that , well , we chicken out here and go away because it &apos;s too tense , or we go even further in asking , what else is bothering you ?
they use these to design with and they design for them , which is why we end up sitting in restaurants that look like this — ( loud crowd noise ) — and sound like this , shouting from a foot away to try and be heard by our dinner companion , or why we get on airplanes — ( flight attendant announcements ) — which cost 200 million pounds , with somebody talking through an old-fashioned telephone handset on a cheap stereo system , making us jump out of our skins .
and if it isn &apos;t then it produces a shape which is very phonaesthetically tightly coupled to the sounds you made .
we can &apos;t pick the future , but we can steer the future .
shared memories — that &apos;s where the old bbc building was ; and personal memories — that &apos;s where i gave my first kiss .
in 2001 , this building received an award .
owl , yeah .
doctor , whatever you say , i accept it .
and what was really great is , i &apos;m putting all this work together in the background , and laura sent me a follow-up email because a good month had passed by .
and that is a slide taken from a tv set and it was pre-processed to be very sympathetic to the tv medium , and it absolutely looks beautiful .
we &apos;re doing this at the cedars-sinai heart institute in the women &apos;s heart center .
1.1 million of them .
it &apos;s saturday . it &apos;s the holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot; because i have to exchange your father &apos;s underwear . &quot;
now imagine what these already ingenious communities could create themselves , and how highly particular their solutions would be , if they were given the basic infrastructures that they could tap into .
( laughter ) this science is different , more general , than the mathematics-based science that we &apos;ve had for the past 300 or so years .
and so that gives you an idea of how exquisitely sensitive this is .
the maasais , the boys are brought up to be warriors .
well , i was very sorry to point out that the pure man &apos;s mind has , in fact , seen at long last what had been seen for a long time .
well , &quot; &quot; rare earth &quot; &quot; actually taught me an awful lot about meeting the public .
and that &apos;s good , it gets two plusses .
what they do best is make a synthesis of human needs , current conditions in economy , in materials , in sustainability issues , and then what they do at the end — if they are good — is much more than the sum of its parts .
so this also works for the house , for at home .
we make it ourselves .
the instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification , etc . , etc .
ca : ed , thank you .
now you might ask yourself , how did he do that ?
so the first example i &apos;m going to talk about relates to children with learning impairments .
and obviously he never came down . the statement was never made .
we were living through a time of tectonic shifts in ideologies , in politics , in religion , in populations .
but i &apos;ll try to convince you that spectroscopy is actually something which can change this world .
it &apos;s been a privilege talking to you .
so we took these hundred dollar bills , and we put them on a website called tenthousandscents.com , where you can browse through and see all the individual contributions .
fold .
now , you might think , well , we &apos;re human because of our dna , but it turns out that each of us has about 20,000 human genes , depending on what you count exactly , but as many as two million to 20 million microbial genes .
this fabrication of place could be one of the world &apos;s greatest achievements , because no one belongs here ; everyone does .
let &apos;s say the revenue of microsoft .
some dancers , when they &apos;re watching action , take the overall shape , the arc of the movement , the kinetic sense of the movement , and use that for memory .
now i cannot tell you how incredibly excited the u.s. military was by the news of the norden bombsight .
and , of course , graphics : today 84 dollars and 97 cents at best buy buys you more graphics power than you could have gotten for a million bucks from sgi only a decade ago .
and those are the questions that inspired my new project , which is debuting here today at ted .
( laughter ) just for my workshop .
and the purpose is not to walk in and construct a home and live there .
these structures are called cilia , and they actually move the mucus out of the lung .
so it &apos;s very well known to engineers , not as well known to biologists .
and what &apos;s exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors who are building innovations that recognize that what people want is freedom and choice and opportunity .
and one of the reasons is , in south africa , it costs 100 dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity .
but you &apos;re going to get home and realize how different life is . &quot; &quot; and i got home and something happened .
they carried me around and put me on the table , and put the knife between my legs .
two million years ago humans evolved in africa and then slowly but surely spread out across the entire planet by reaching into the wilderness that was beyond their horizons .
and why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now ?
on 9 / 11 , joel wasn &apos;t in new york . he was out of town , but he raced back to the city , and raced down to the site of the destruction .
they teach us about what happens in the complex organism .
and so for me , a mesh company , the &quot; &quot; classic &quot; &quot; mesh company , brings together these three things : our ability to connect to each other — most of us are walking around with these mobile devices that are gps-enabled and web-enabled — allows us to find each other and find things in time and space .
and again , we can see it in slightly different form there , with the bubble forming and collapsing between those two surfaces .
so we came up with one neighborhood typology — there are several — called a live-make neighborhood , where folks could reappropriate abandoned structures and turn them into entrepreneurial enterprises , with a specific emphasis on looking at the , again , majority 82 percent african-american population .
so that &apos;s , as i said , the little diversion on my main love .
i turn them into two and three-dimensional pieces and sculptures and installations .
it &apos;s as though you made something resonate within them .
or maybe it was 31 and a quarter percent .
let me give you another example of delegation .
particularly if we continue to approach the transformation of organizations the way we always have been .
life in space is really not necessarily about how we do things , but why we do things .
there &apos;s a much deeper connection , which i don &apos;t have time to go into and that is that modern genetics is a really exciting area of science .
here &apos;s the second reason .
they also kiss , hold hands , pat one another on the back .
you need to understand that in those places what really mattered was , firstly , the role of tudman and milosevic in coming to the agreement , and then the fact those men went , that the regional situation improved , that the european union could offer bosnia something extraordinary : the chance to be part of a new thing , a new club , a chance to join something bigger .
now , that &apos;s the good news .
the kids of today , they tap , swipe and pinch their way through the world .
and immediately , a lot of different responsibilities , in terms of my education and so forth , were heaped upon me .
and scientists have a lot of theories about why this is , but almost all of them involve nutrition , namely the increase of dairy and meat .
you look outside : you have all that beauty that you see , all that life that you see around you , and here we have intelligent people like you and i who are having a conversation here .
thank you very much .
if you go on the streets of india and china , you see this kind of stuff .
they also get free land in between the trees , where they can grow their crops .
they did not have any pardas inside their body , hijabs inside themselves ; they &apos;ve crossed the barrier of it .
they sit , they watch the goldfish in the fish tank , they read extremely old copies of good housekeeping magazine .
on the graph paper , you can see how all the lines on the graph paper have been distorted .
since there was nothing there , you might as well not look .
if you wanted to put all of the published works online so that anybody could have it available , well , how big a problem is it ?
( applause ) but something as basic as happiness , which 20 years ago would have been just something for discussion in the church or mosque or synagogue , today it turns out that there &apos;s dozens of ted-like questions that you can ask about it , which are really interesting .
i did it for your own good .
and so they did .
this simulation was run on 1,000 processors for a month in order to make just this simple visible one .
the architecture is telling a story . the architecture is telling a story
that &apos;s the alliance that changes the world .
we set out to do this .
their job is to get things done , and if they don &apos;t , they &apos;re out of a job .
it was a bunch of people who wanted to bring in democracy because they wanted to bring in the idea of universal voting and parliament and constitution and so forth .
and that &apos;s what happens to currencies when you don &apos;t stand behind them .
now , think about where the world would be today if we had the light bulb , but you couldn &apos;t focus light ; if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to .
dude , are you from canada ? ( laughter ) so , like , whatever , with grand theft auto , you &apos;re this kid , like , you &apos;re this guy walking around or whatever , and you can basically , like , the more cops you kill , the more points you get , and stuff like that .
sub-surface water on mars , frozen in the form of ice .
the fundamental issue is that , for me , design is the first signal of human intentions .
that is a bit counterintuitive .
were there things that weren &apos;t being done ?
the thing that was always striking to me was that we as people could have so many really amazing ideas about things we &apos;d like to do , but are so often unable , in the real world , to actually do those things — to actually cobble together the materials and go through the actual execution phase of building something that you imagine from a design perspective .
and i certainly don &apos;t know all the people who might be watching this talk over the internet , somewhere in buenos aires or in new delhi .
the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually scale by strengthening civil society .
( laughter ) we can build a better vine .
columns are architectural archetypes .
so i thought , three words for one concept . this is not good .
we know looting is going on on a global scale and it &apos;s increasing , but presently we don &apos;t have any tools to stop it .
that &apos;s my mom .
and they will need chemistry . that &apos;s the point .
so , it &apos;s a normal-looking syringe .
the damage comes in the form of a double-strand break through the double helix .
and it &apos;s specifically algorithms , which are basically the math that computers use to decide stuff .
each of the 188 members of the imf hold sdr quotas as part of their foreign exchange reserves .
turns out , all he wanted to do was to stack the siftables up .
and my mother bought this book when we were at the grand canyon called &quot; &quot; the hot zone . &quot; &quot; it was all about the outbreak of the ebola virus .
this shift has created what professor nicolaus mills calls a culture of humiliation .
pity , i would have told them it was the ace of spades .
so i went on for the next 20 years or so making a lot of different games .
they need jobs in the public health sector or in nonprofit health centers to put their training and commitment to work .
we collect four gigabits per second of data , if you can imagine that kind of data stream coming down .
at risd , you &apos;re not allowed to draw from an image .
( video ) samantha masters : that &apos;s what &apos;s up , man , this is a righteous man over here .
and this is how we come to care for the common good .
and it &apos;s looking up on the wooded heights of washington heights to jeffrey &apos;s hook , where the george washington bridge goes across today .
and then they talk , and then we pass the baton back and forth between each other .
the support may come in asking people questions , giving them a sheet of paper that has an organizational chart on it or has some guiding images , but we need to support it .
and i couldn &apos;t hear this sound .
and in that time they developed these subtle differences in the genetic architecture behind their blindness .
also , i can imagine many design manufacturers will have to retool their own business plans and maybe invest in this kinko &apos;s store . but it really is a big change .
you know , that &apos;s how you do science .
there was no one to comfort me .
they are hospital ships .
and that &apos;s a good thing to measure in m.s. , because patients with m.s. sadly suffer with problems with vision — loss of vision , unclear vision .
and who would want to tax one &apos;s son ?
( laughter ) this formula works wherever metaphor is present .
but i also am in the fueling business .
and i &apos;ll just do that one more time .
now , in non-tech speak , what that basically means is taking big , multi-year projects and breaking them up into bite-sized chunks , so that way we can reduce the risk and actually start to see results every couple of weeks , instead of waiting in a black box for years .
this jump up in energy in 2015 represented the best chance that we as a species had ever had of discovering new particles — new answers to these long-standing questions , because it was almost twice as much energy as we used when we discovered the higgs boson .
you &apos;d be surprised to know that most of the girls that i have spoken to , who did not know about periods at the time of their first menstruation thought that they have got blood cancer and they &apos;re going to die soon .
what are my options ? what choices are now on the table ?
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
and they can pinch them very tight and stop it , or you can have them wide open .
this is a fundamental question that most of us are asking .
i &apos;d watch those same men walking back home every night .
you know where i &apos;m going with that .
but there is one thing i know how to do : i know how to program a computer .
and just this past february , i won two back-to-back world cup gold medals — ( applause ) — which made me the highest ranked adaptive female snowboarder in the world .
as we know , only half the states have opted in .
so we threw in — we created a primordial soup with lots of pieces of robots — with bars , with motors , with neurons .
and fix it .
reputation will be the currency that says that you can trust me .
no one in my family ever had joined the military at all , and how i first got introduced to the military was when i was 13 years old and i got sent away to military school , because my mother had been threatening me with this idea of military school ever since i was eight years old .
but this complement may be much inferior to what , with other laws and institutions , the nature of its soil , climate , and situation might admit of . &quot; &quot; that is so right and so cool .
once you figure this out , you can really impress people at parties .
a hanger .
even the most data-savvy companies get it wrong .
from a few bones , we infer the existence of dinosuars .
and i have four observations i &apos;d like to share with you today .
♫ i believe the almighty knows each and every one of you ♫ ♫ by your name ♫ ♫ women of hope ♫ ♫ women of change ♫ ♫ women of love , joy , no shame ♫ ♫ you &apos;ve got something this little life ♫ ♫ can never take away ♫ ♫ running through the darkness of night ♫ ♫ with a child by her side ♫ ♫ oh lord , won &apos;t you give them ♫ ♫ a shining armor of light ♫ ♫ oh lord , won &apos;t you give them ♫ ♫ a shining armor of light ♫ ♫ daybreak brings a sign of new life ♫
so the idea here is that the ants are working so hard to hang on to the wall or the floor or whatever you call it that they &apos;re less likely to interact , and so the relationship between how crowded they are and how often they meet would be messed up .
we &apos;ve had good enough , really , very powerful effects with kids around the world , and now people of all ages , using hyperscore .
i &apos;ve met a young man in new york whose illiterate mother in a village in senegal takes a bus once a month to the capital city of dakar , just to watch a bollywood movie .
this is what happens when you route these electrical storms to a loudspeaker and you listen to a hundred brain cells firing , your brain will sound like this — my brain , any brain .
working together is what changes our world .
in 1935 , there were 150,000 cases a year of malaria in the united states , but ddt and a massive public health effort managed to squelch it .
we &apos;ve been able to ensure better futures for the people and the bears .
and then i left .
there &apos;s a flip side as well .
but also , there seems to be a complete sort of gridlock in terms of solving these small solutions .
the only way out of poverty is through business enterprise .
we &apos;ve been more successful in the case of drug policy .
they &apos;re reconstructive .
is it because women don &apos;t look like men , they don &apos;t look like that male-pattern heart disease that we &apos;ve spent the last 50 years understanding and getting really good diagnostics and really good therapeutics , and therefore , they &apos;re not recognized for their heart disease .
but go and look at what is in there .
and one of my favorite robots is leonardo .
kkhh !
we &apos;re 25 , 26 years after the advent of the macintosh , which was an astoundingly seminal event in the history of human-machine interface and in computation in general .
( laughter ) who will start me with $ 1,000 ? anyone ?
unfortunately , such emotion-related facial blood flow changes are too subtle to detect by our naked eye .
( applause ) he refused to be provoked by petty grievances .
ec : right , right .
it calls on us to access that which is most universal and most intimate : a love of our brother and our sister and our neighbor .
does it work ? doesn &apos;t it work ? and so on .
and then i said , carry on . carry on . carry on .
well , you should see some kind of two-legged animal here , and then the mirror image of them there .
the more we saturate our culture with public shaming , the more accepted it is , the more we will see behavior like cyberbullying , trolling , some forms of hacking , and online harassment .
we &apos;ll do some side-by-side comparisons here .
i &apos;m not skiing along drawing maps ; everyone knows where the north pole is .
and i thought to myself : what the hell have i done ?
i know you &apos;ve never heard of him , but just mark this day that someday you will hear of him , because he &apos;s really an amazing man . &quot; &quot; frank gehry : i heard he had some kind of a fling with ingrid bergman . is that true ?
i was just always trying to make things .
and these meetings had this effect while taking under 20 minutes .
thank you .
they targeted to universities .
( laughter ) but i think the biggest conceptual pitfall that cybertopians made is when it comes to digital natives , people who have grown up online .
( applause )
and as we walk in , it is a scene i can only describe you as saying it looked like norway threw up .
( laughter ) so i did the thing .
what is the imagery of god ?
where i couldn &apos;t stop looking .
we repeated the experiment with the same two groups , this time adding a delay between the time we told subjects how we would use their data and the time we actually started answering the questions .
cisgender means the gender i was assigned at birth is still and has always been female .
and it &apos;s fair to say that if we don &apos;t succeed , it &apos;s difficult to see who will .
now that , i would say , is architecture performing .
in 1951 , escher made this drawing . he thought he created an animal fantasy .
if you think 20 percent of genetic information in your nose is a lot of biological dark matter , if we looked at your gut , up to 40 or 50 percent of that information is biological dark matter .
all these choices involve value judgments and social norms , not objective facts .
and i &apos;m your mirror .
it goes into the soil , ending its journey in the lakes , resulting in lakes with extra phosphorus , which leads to the blue algae problem .
so my goal was to overcome the disadvantages of these current treatment methods and create a safe , sustainable , cost-effective and eco-friendly method of purifying water .
and then they would remember the first part of last century , which was really bad , and we could go by this so-called great leap forward .
so i &apos;m here to tell you a story of success from africa .
we could get them .
so the metaphor i &apos;d like the use i can take from a story of a great idea that &apos;s quite recent — a lot more recent than the 1650s .
it was also people &apos;s deep longing for freedom .
i &apos;m going to begin by reciting a poem .
but he was also in oxford in the &apos; 50s , and yet growing up as a child in nigeria , my father used to say to me , &quot; &quot; you must never eat or drink in a yoruba person &apos;s house because they will poison you . &quot; &quot; it makes sense now when i think about it , because if you &apos;d known my father , you would &apos;ve wanted to poison him too .
we wanted to do something now .
we also heard that 250 billion indian rupees was dedicated for government schooling .
i didn &apos;t expect that person that i was going to meet to be him .
js : god knows .
this raises the very real possibility of anonymous war .
the best chess players spend a lot of time not playing games of chess , which would be their performance zone , but trying to predict the moves grand masters made and analyzing them .
good .
but you can see how your people are communicating with each other , what times they call each other , when they go to bed .
extruded typography that &apos;s backlit with neon .
at verdun , in 1916 , over a 300-day period , 700,000 people were killed , so about 2,000 a day .
but lizzie wolf has shown that when we frame our strong emotions as passion , the condemnation of our crying disappears for both men and women .
and i &apos;m also being told that the drum is without snares .
( music ) &#91; basque &#93; ( music ) thank you .
this is a simulation that uses graphics , but other people find motivating what money can buy , not just numbers .
how many children did you have ?
does evolution control the sophistication of matter in the universe ?
i &apos;m in something big , bad and ugly .
and while the hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological dark matter are really only in their infancy , there &apos;s a very , very exciting possibility that exists : that buried in this life , in this genetic information , are signatures of as of yet unidentified life .
but why ?
this solution was initially designed for the chinese market , but now it &apos;s selling like hotcakes in the u.s. and europe , where hospitals are pressured to deliver quality care at lower cost .
now , finning is the act of taking a shark , cutting the valuable fins off and throwing the live animal back in the water .
and then the secretary-general of the united nations came up to speak to god and said , &quot; when will our international institutions work ? &quot;
we don &apos;t want to have what there is in the west .
my dad was a high-ranking gang member who ran the streets .
when i listened to all the stories everywhere i went on the continents , i couldn &apos;t always understand the complicated circumstances of their conflict .
in fact , i think that most of it has to do with body size — the size you are when you inherit a vacant ecospace from whatever natural disaster .
so the adoption papers were signed .
there are the lunch ladies in kentucky who realized that 67 percent of their students relied on those meals every day , and they were going without food over the summer , so they retrofitted a school bus to create a mobile feeding unit , and they traveled around the neighborhoods feedings 500 kids a day during the summer .
now , creative works may indeed be kind of like property , but it &apos;s property that we &apos;re all building on , and creations can only take root and grow once that ground has been prepared .
but if you think about it , if you have a lily pad and it just divided every single day — two , four , eight , 16 — in 15 days you have 32,000 .
and so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in , we can do that .
and if we want to cure ourselves of ndd , or nature deficit disorder , i think this is a great way of doing it .
basically , we tribalize , and that process of unifying feels so good and is so good for us , that it even helps people who are struggling with mental health issues .
i was so lucky to watch the change of that south africa into the new south africa as i went year by year .
that is a &quot; &quot; who is who &quot; &quot; list .
but i think i get to come back to this , because imagine having a compact reactor in a rocket that produces 50 to 100 megawatts .
i was more concerned with touching the screen on my apple than actually feeding him one .
and an ipad .
actually , i read this great quote the other day , which was , &quot; style makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you &apos;re going to die . &quot;
you see , indian music , for example , does not have the concept of harmony .
and that montana is a beautiful place to visit but you do not want to live there , because it is the number one state for suicidal ideation .
so how many other madoffs are there on wall street or in the city of london , fleecing ordinary folk and money laundering ?

we &apos;ve seen a coercion strategy in which sexual structures are used in a forceful way to basically make a female have sex .
we need to elongate the time frame upon which we judge the balance in our life , but we need to elongate it without falling into the trap of the &quot; &quot; i &apos;ll have a life when i retire , when my kids have left home , when my wife has divorced me , my health is failing , i &apos;ve got no mates or interests left . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) a day is too short ; &quot; &quot; after i retire &quot; &quot; is too long .
enough excuses .
so we just switch off : us , governments and aid agencies .
i &apos;m going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this that we demonstrated in washington . can we look at this thing ?
you may have noticed in the baseball and pizza comparison , under the baseball , it &apos;s all commands .
the computers back up each other . there &apos;s a voting system — if one computer is not agreeing with the other three , it &apos;s kicked out of the system .

so try to tell me which child is lying and which child is telling the truth .

they &apos;re also , number three , the most efficient repairers of fractures that we &apos;ve ever encountered .
our school systems are very flawed and do not reward you for the things that are important in life or for the survival of civilization ; they reward you for a lot of learning and sopping up stuff .
now , many of you have heard the phrase the &quot; &quot; double bind &quot; &quot; and connected it with one thing , and that &apos;s gender .
redwoods grow very slowly in their tops .
so to compensate , i &apos;d hold the pen tighter , and this progressively made the shake worse , so i &apos;d hold the pen tighter still .
but i &apos;m just saying , if y &apos;all are interested in the top five songs , you need to holler at me .
so , birds chirping outside your window may indicate normality , perhaps because , as a species , we &apos;ve been used to that sound every morning for millions of years .
the pilot , i knew , was called troy . i was expecting someone called troy that did this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy .

all peoples are simply cultural options , different visions of life itself .
sometimes , we ask ourselves if we can save the vets .

most people think it &apos;s land mines , but it &apos;s a vehicle accident .
around the world today we &apos;re seeing an incredible transformation , from what i would call a biocidal species , one that — whether we intentionally or unintentionally — have designed our systems to kill life , a lot of the time .
but what we do know is that it isn &apos;t 10 years or 10 billion dollars or a large humanoid robot away .
this last project is also of components .
( clang ) ( laughs ) now obviously , as maddie &apos;s chemistry teacher , i love that she went home and continued to geek out about this kind of ridiculous demonstration that we did in class .
that &apos;s wrong because the theory is quantum mechanical .
and we build buildings of different sizes and styles and different materials , depending on where we are .
( laughter ) before there was data , this was the decision-making device to use . ( laughter )
now raise your hand if any of this is sounding familiar to you , from your part of the world .
it stands guard at the boundary between the known and the unknown , because in order to discover something truly new , at least one of your basic assumptions has to change , and that means that in science , we do something quite heroic .
the woman i thought i was would have said yes .
thank you . thank you . ( applause )
a lot of sexuality education that happens today is so influenced by the baseball model , and it sets up education that can &apos;t help but produce unhealthy sexuality in young people .

my vote won &apos;t count .
when we are in medical school , we learn our anatomy from illustrations such as this where everything &apos;s color-coded .
so as a child , my parents used to drag me to these family events .
and one month ago we have unveiled it .
it &apos;s done by geologists , engineers , biologists , all sorts of different people — modeling and simulation .
that means the host probably stopped listening two minutes ago because he thought of this really clever question , and he was just bound and determined to say that .
we found this leopard in a 2,000-year-old baobab tree in africa , the same tree that we found her mother in and her grandmother .
and this is because one of the things we &apos;ve learned over the last decade of studying market development in africa is that the piecemeal approach does not work .
i &apos;ll just tell you quickly about two stories drawn from recent headlines .
it could be that on one day , the colony is split between two boxes , but on another day , it could be together in a single box , or split between three or more boxes , and that all seems rather erratic , really .
ok now , more importantly , had we been there in the &apos; 40s and &apos; 50s , &apos; 60s , had we seen this disease , had we understood exactly what was going on with it , how might that have changed and completely transformed the nature of the way this pandemic moved ?
and so we met dr. sono khangharani in pakistan .
and the marketing is that not matter how much you &apos;ve invested in your brand , one bad week can undermine decades of good work .
of course , what would we be without computers ?
yeah , it &apos;s very different — no , it &apos;s not different .
now it &apos;s important to understand that this room is cooled by water , heated by water , filters its own water , and it &apos;s powered by water .
hi , elizabeth , i loved your talk .
he came up with a 200-year-old idea called moiré patterns .
start with 10,000 empty boxes and an org chart covering down to every minor city .
she is now an integral member of our family , having been with us since alia was six months old .
( laughter ) and my idea is this — all these men and women should be free to decide whether they do or do not want to conceive a child .
this is allowing them to find the bonding nodes in any lattice of atoms .
hello .
( laughter ) now again , we kind of caved in , and we did the very practical approach , which was a bit less awesome .
it said things like , &quot; &quot; in many important ways we are causing real harm to the places we live in , &quot; &quot; and , &quot; &quot; it is essential that we take steps now to prevent further destruction from being done to our earth . &quot; &quot; another group of participants were assigned to read a really different essay that was designed to tap into the conservative value of moral purity .
we were one of the lucky ones to get in the class with the sony cameras and the vista software .
and it takes them about a million years to settle out .
so what we &apos;ve done here is , more or less , a reverse turing test .
a generous mistress whom many loved much .
and as these tectonic plates are spreading apart , magma , lava is coming up and filling those gaps , and you &apos;re looking land — new land — being created right before your eyes .
doing nothing at work is akin to masturbating at work ; it &apos;s totally inappropriate .
and we have a little video that describes the sequence .
there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much .
it was that little outliers there . you see that guy that lived a long time ?
music was once a very physical thing .
okay . ( laughs ) right .
seven years ago , an even faster and cheaper american manufacturing technology was used to make this little carbon fiber test part , which doubles as a carbon cap .
and there is as many different kinds of pollen as there are flowering plants .
that &apos;s the idea , and we &apos;re setting this up in the bay area .
and i think that &apos;s symbolic of what we &apos;re seeing in the world in general , that the world is becoming smaller and smaller , and that all of the peoples in the world are enjoying more opportunities for connection .
he &apos;s another young designer from france who &apos;s working — and at this point he &apos;s working , also , with pharmaceutical companies — on new ways to engage patients , especially children , in taking their medicines with constancy and with certainty .
our group , palliative care , in 2012 , working with the sickest of the sick — cancer , heart disease , lung disease , renal disease , dementia — how did we improve patient experience ?
so this is a picture of birds generated entirely by a neural network that was trained to recognize birds , just by solving for x rather than solving for y , and doing that iteratively .
for a data scientist that just happened to go to space camp as a kid , it just doesn &apos;t get much better than that .
now , the great news about all this , and we have a ton of work left to do , and we have a lot of culture to change , but the great news about all of it is that we know it works .
i don &apos;t there &apos;s anyone in this room who &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; well , the right way to start would be , let &apos;s make a great seat belt for adults .

for me , air is plural .
( music ) ( applause ) talking about geometry and everything , if you take the circle and you split it in half — can you run &quot; &quot; s-curve music ? &quot; &quot; i &apos;m going to do just a short version of it .
so i think we need a deeper understanding of how people , money , power , religion , culture , technology interact to change the map of the world .
but it &apos;s a question of how tortuous this path is from those frail beginnings , those seeds , all the way to life .
so our legislators cannot analyze the budget that they are voting for .
i mentioned that to miguel , and he nodded .
we can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything .
after that experience , i changed .

it &apos;s a bee that , yes , flies .

a network is not just the product of its component parts .
it means that the economy is dividing into high-skill , high-wage jobs and low-skill , low-wage jobs — and that the middle , the middle-skill jobs , and the middle-earning jobs , are starting to drop out of the economy .
these are volcanic stones laid by hand .
now there is much to gain and benefit from this massive analysis of personal information , or big data , but there are also complex tradeoffs that come from giving away our privacy .
the more people who know about this technology , the more we can all have a voice in how it &apos;s being used .

this is a graph of autism prevalence estimates rising over time .
and the idea was the relationship of the space , which was made up of the fold of the image , and the dialectic or the conflict between the figuration , and the clarity of the image and the complexity of the space , which were in dialog .

we can insist that all people have the opportunity to learn about contraceptives and have access to the full variety of methods .
and he got me a super 8 camera when i was 10 years old .
months later , maybe about two months later , i started about getting my job back , which is something , when you become this primary caregiver person , which some people in the audience here have certainly been in that position , it &apos;s a challenging role but at some point you &apos;ve got to figure out when you &apos;re going to get your life back , and at the time , i couldn &apos;t ask gabby if she wanted me to go fly in the space shuttle again .
this shift is the most striking in the u.s. and in the u.k. , but it &apos;s a global phenomenon .
obviously it was shown , and it was amazing .
this is a campaign done by a young artist in new york , who calls himself &quot; &quot; true . &quot; &quot; everybody who has ridden the new york subway system will be familiar with these signs ?
but we &apos;d also see something very , very surprising .
i might not be your typical person you find on this stage .
i set it up with the foreman . i set it up with the owner of the land .
so our first critical moment , it &apos;s open .
major moves , outside of our equatorial homeland , from africa into other parts of the old world , and most recently , into the new world .
you can just change a couple of the dna strands in this binary representation and you &apos;ll get 96 rather than 32 .

and many , many people wanted to join us , because you don &apos;t go into this kind of work to manage a system , you go in because you can and you want to make a difference .
i broke it into a top tier and a second tier of points , and i ranked everything starting at 100 and going all the way down to 91 , and listing things like i was looking for somebody who was really smart , who would challenge and stimulate me , and balancing that with a second tier and a second set of points .
and then literally , you now pour on a monomer .
i said , &quot; &quot; how much is it worth ? &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; we will start with smaller quantity , &quot; &quot; — i was like , aww — and then he said , &quot; &quot; of 25 kgs . ( laughter )

here we go .
in fact , we &apos;re separated by 95 million years of divergent evolution .
it turns out it &apos;s not rocket science to design a sacred space .
but if we want to look at the sky and see predictions , we still can .
so here &apos;s a general rule of thumb that i believe in : when societies have strong institutions , the difference that one good leader can make is limited , but when you have weak institutions , then just one good leader can make or break that country .

we can &apos;t settle for that , which is why the concern about the eighth goal , which relates to funding , which i said at the beginning is falling , is so troubling .
it &apos;s also carried on migration patterns of wild migratory aquatic birds .
because i think it &apos;s an urgent question .
and that &apos;s the way it is with definitions of words .
and i would imagine that a lot of you have too .
they give me , i don &apos;t know , a sense of correctness in the world and some visual delight in the knowledge that the building will probably never look as good as this simple industrial scaffolding that is there to serve .
and the last one is destructive attacks , and those are the ones that concern me the most .
simply put , when the impulse is to change the world , the academy is more likely to engender a learned helplessness than to create a sense of empowerment .
just complete domination .
but that was my first real experience as a solo singer-songwriter .
you may have worried that you ate carbs after 7pm last night , and that you really should renew your gym membership .
so i was trained as a historian .
it &apos;s two people dropping the pretense of being know-it-alls .
the first , to my mind , is what i call as &quot; &quot; the ideas that have arrived . &quot; &quot; these ideas have brought together something which has made india happen the way it is today .
but what i &apos;ve come to learn is that the world is never saved in grand messianic gestures , but in the simple accumulation of gentle , soft , almost invisible acts of compassion , everyday acts of compassion .
so we met in november 2002 , and aicha will now tell you how that came about .
for all the names i &apos;ll never know , say her name .
when we say of somebody that he &apos;s &quot; &quot; in it for the money , &quot; &quot; we are not just being descriptive .
the other thing that &apos;s also interesting that &apos;s going on here is the fact that intelligence agencies — and it doesn &apos;t matter who they are — they all operate in an industry where their commodity is information , or restricted access to information .
so jains are not supposed to eat meat .
that &apos;s the principle objective .
we &apos;re down to one and half right now .
the wall that kept me , elyn , professor saks , separate from that insane woman hospitalized years past , lay smashed and in ruins . &quot; &quot; everything about this illness says i shouldn &apos;t be here , but i am . and i am , i think , for three reasons : first , i &apos;ve had excellent treatment .
fg : because i want to get a standing ovation like everybody , so ...
because if you double one percent seven more times , which is exactly what happened , you get 100 percent . and the project was finished on time .
it tells a story . the story can reach into obscure desires .
we were going to exist . here &apos;s another one .
crispr is going to be amazing , in terms of the number of different scientific advances that it &apos;s going to catalyze .
this was reinforced by the political climate of the time .
i &apos;m going to think about it in 3d space . so now , instead of it just being a letter that &apos;s in front of me , it &apos;s a space that my body can go inside of .
so in a yin-yang way , silence needs loudness and loudness needs silence for either of them to have any effect .
we symmetrize the face , and we run our algorithm .
but i was committed to making sure that i could do anything possible to make her stay more comfortable . i brought her a warm blanket and a cup of a coffee .
so hopefully tomorrow i ’ ll show one or two more objects from the stage , but for today i just wanted to say thank you for all the people that came and talked to us about it .
and this person is particularly interesting .
in contrast , in traditional societies without writing , older people are the repositories of information .
the u.s. news &amp; world report ranks colleges just as the consumer report rates washing machines .
i don &apos;t know how to prevent that , but i &apos;m at least going to use my good offices to get you folks together to come up with a response . &quot; &quot; so they formed a white house task force , and they spent about three years arguing about who takes how much responsibility in the global supply chain .
first of all , you have to edit ruthlessly .
so if you look at this , you might immediately grasp that different people have different numbers of connections .
( applause ) we &apos;re delighted about it as well .
and that &apos;ll make such a huge difference on the system , because the amount of waiting time and the amount of distances that people need to travel , often sometimes seven to 15 kilometers , sometimes by foot , to get a simple health check done , is very , very detrimental in the sense that it really dissuades people from getting access to health care .
but mucus is actually very important .
and then we had some hint that these things existed all along the axis of it , because if you &apos;ve got volcanism , water &apos;s going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor , come in contact with magma , and come shooting out hot .
this year &apos;s swine flu strain grew very poorly in early production : basically .6 doses per egg .
i need a hundred billion . &quot; &quot; so i &apos;m like that .
we won &apos;t bring anything with us .
how does life make things ?
so what do you think happens to these gals ?
it has led me to further my research and to use it as a model for my laboratory research .
( applause ) thank you very much . ( applause )
we need to learn from those figures that i mentioned .
i talk about race and this question of whether we deserve to kill .
well , there are steps we can take to navigate our way through the morass .
those combinations yield very much more than the sum of the parts , especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities .
for a two-year-old , that is like a tattoo . ( laughter ) you know ? you only get one birthday per year .
as the sign said back there , &quot; &quot; without limitations . &quot; &quot; they knew no other way to live than to follow their dreams .
in this case , supply right next to demand .
( applause )
( chomping ) ( drum roll ) ( toilet flushing ) okay . next to the pitch region is another set of regions that are selectively responsive when you hear the sounds of speech .
( laughter ) but sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that .
that chin barbel is flashing .
he had three or four friends with him , and he does that , and they all look , and there was no infection , and they bend over me and they &apos;re poking and prodding , and they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; there &apos;s no hematomas , blah blah , look at the color , &quot; &quot; and they &apos;re talking amongst themselves and i &apos;m , like , this restored automobile that he &apos;s just going , &quot; &quot; yeah , i did that . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and it was just , it was amazing , because these guys are high-fiving him over how good i turned out , you know ? ( laughter ) and it &apos;s my zipper , and i &apos;ve still got the staples in and everything . and
how is that possible ? let &apos;s go to something else .
simplicity is a neat word . and you &apos;ve got to think about what simplicity means .
this does not mean that it &apos;s the final solution , or that this even provides permanent protection .
no , it matters quite a bit , and i &apos;ll give you an example of why .
here you see actually how the damage appears in this material .
( applause )
a terrific use of local materials , but inside you could find some interior compositions .
i started improv everywhere about 10 years ago when i moved to new york city with an interest in acting and comedy .
and this idea , again , came from the grassroots , from two googlers who wrote their own job descriptions and volunteered themselves for the job .
and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i &apos;ve been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me .
my accent with english improved a lot .
behind the destruction , i found a soul of places .
the goal of spacex is to try to advance rocket technology , and in particular to try to crack a problem that i think is vital for humanity to become a space-faring civilization , which is to have a rapidly and fully reusable rocket .
it &apos;s very , very , very detailed inside with the design .
there &apos;s a growing extremism that comes from both sides in this debate , in response to this conflict between the law and the use of these technologies .
there are some creatures on this planet already that don &apos;t really do aging .
but this time , the migration leaves african-americans in place , as families and businesses flee the city , leaving the city pretty desolate of people as well as jobs .
disease .
now xu and i , on the other hand , were in a completely windowless black room not making any ocular movement that even remotely resembles an eye blink because our eyes were fixed onto a computer screen .
( laughter ) lg : yeah , armani . ok .
it &apos;s actually not limited to films .
so we said , there &apos;s just got to be a better way to do this .
now , if violence is re-concentrating geographically , it &apos;s also being reconfigured to the world &apos;s new topography , because when it comes to cities , the world ain &apos;t flat , like thomas friedman likes to say .
but i don &apos;t want you in the frame , i don &apos;t want you in the window , i want you through the window , i want you on the other side , in the world , inhabiting the world .
the bigger the crowd , the more potential innovators there are .
we can never go back to a place and find it exactly where we left it .
one of the reasons , i think , is a sort of boiled frog phenomenon .
now , let &apos;s put aside the online anonymous sex chatrooms , which i &apos;m sure none of you have been in .
and before long , in some months , raisuddin was that olive garden &apos;s highest grossing alcohol pusher .
let &apos;s look at a country like india .
so this story is the first of 18 chapters in my new body of work titled &quot; &quot; a living man declared dead and other chapters . &quot; &quot; and for this work , i traveled around the world over a four-year period researching and recording bloodlines and their related stories .
i &apos;ll follow her advice . i &apos;ll stop talking .
i photograph from a fixed vantage point , and i never move .
there &apos;s several examples up on the screen of situations where doctors are looking to implant devices inside of people , and all of these devices now , it &apos;s standard that they communicate wirelessly , and i think this is great , but without a full understanding of trustworthy computing , and without understanding what attackers can do and the security risks from the beginning , there &apos;s a lot of danger in this .
once you start down at this very humble level , then you can start finding ways to see things .
and that is a room that was built for a woman named nancy wilson , who recorded that album at our school last christmas .
and the way to ask that question is to look at the neanderthal that comes from southern europe and compare it to genomes of people who live today .
molas are infamous for carrying tons of parasites .
i mean , we &apos;re not putting this one back .
i went down there in the winter time .
the second thing you need is light .
no , it doesn &apos;t mean that at all .
anybody do any writing today ? did anybody write a word ?
so that when we begin to grapple with the ideas of artificial intelligence in the future , we shouldn &apos;t only be asking ourselves , &quot; can we build it ? &quot;
but there is a problem with that view .
it went up to 49 .
naela ayyash , who strived to build a self-sufficient palestinian economy by encouraging women in gaza to grow vegetables in their backyards , an activity deemed illegal by the israeli authorities at that time ; rabeha diab , who took over decision-making authority for the entire uprising when the men who had been running it were deported ; fatima al jaafari , who swallowed leaflets containing the uprising &apos;s directives in order to spread them across the territories without getting caught ; and zahira kamal , who ensured the longevity of the uprising by leading an organization that went from 25 women to 3,000 in a single year .
well it turns out that the computer analogy is just as valid for emotion .
the right of peoples to live together in the same state , worshiping differently , freely — a middle east , a world , in which religion is not the subject of division or of debate .
but i had no idea what the context was or what that even , what it even meant to the people who heard it .
1998 : a single mother of four , three months after the birth of my fourth child , i went to do a job as a research assistant .
combining the live play and the serialization of written fiction , you get this new format .
they &apos;re going at a meter a second . how many think the one on the left is running up the wall ?
we have complete control over his blush responses , the diameter of his nostrils to denote stress .
em : it must , actually . if it doesn &apos;t , we &apos;re in deep trouble .
&quot; i feel very lonely . &quot;
this is the view looking down the hudson river , with manhattan on the left , and new jersey out on the right , looking out toward the atlantic ocean .
( audience : five of clubs . ) lg : pardon ? ( audience : five of clubs . ) lg : five of clubs . it &apos;s not the same person , even if it &apos;s the same spot .
because the real peak is hidden around the corner .
the six-year-old is in a car seat , and it turns out that looks terrible , but that &apos;s great . that &apos;s like a 400 , ok ?
&quot; &quot; to say that something is essential is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the achievement of a certain object .
so i like to invent things too , and i think i &apos;ll close out my set with something i invented a good while back .
so one of the big bellwethers , and one of my final points i want to mention , is the interesting thing i read is that cnbc has launched their first african channel . why is cnbc doing this ?
we get one child like that about every classroom of 30 kids who will actually cut straight to the chase .
but we are indeed heading for a major crisis , and i ’ d like people to become aware of this problem .
everyone on the team knew that i have a wife and two small children — 10 and 15 — and i wanted to come back safely .
and the whole series of work came out of it .
very quickly , i felt like i didn &apos;t belong .
what we rarely do is ask refugees what they want , where they want to go , but i &apos;d argue we can do that and still make everyone better off .
the second is that traditional charity and aid are never going to solve the problems of poverty .
and he had a very large head , which she thought might indicate hydrocephalus .
we extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy is up here .
he &apos;s a man , a servant , an older servant looking at this younger servant , saying , &quot; &quot; look at me . i want to warn you about what you &apos;re about to go through . please look at me . &quot; &quot; and he never does .
and so this allows for a controlled delivery of drugs and for reintegration in the environment in all of these formats that you &apos;ve seen .
now , there &apos;s good news and bad news about this corruption .
so for this reason , i think one of the other themes with the mesh is essentially that , if we squeeze hard on things that we &apos;ve thrown away , there &apos;s a lot of value in those things .
and if you look through the eye , or you look at the vessels on the white of the eye , in fact , you may be able to do this directly , without drawing any blood at all , or through your nail beds .
and so , what we found out was that , if you take animals that are animated like you and i , and you make them cold — that is , these were the garden worms — now they &apos;re dead .
they say , &quot; &quot; how dare you take this child out of the house and terrify other people .
it &apos;s a complete denial of mistakes .
basically , a human body is a conversation going on , both within the cells and between the cells , and they &apos;re telling each other to grow and to die , and when you &apos;re sick , something &apos;s gone wrong with that conversation .
because i think it &apos;s not just a cultural space or housing ; there has to be the recreation of an economic core .
here are some fun images . here &apos;s burt rutan and my good friend greg meronek inside a zero gravity — people think a zero gravity room , there &apos;s a switch on there that turns it off — but it &apos;s actually parabolic flight of an airplane .
( applause ) danit peleg : rebecca is wearing one of my five outfits .
and you just never know who is going to take something from that and turn it into something else , because inspiration is cross-pollinating .
these girls are also working in big construction companies like ram-ki construction , as masons , full-time masons .
the whole cementation process takes about 24 hours .
i got the chinese line .
zk : it &apos;s steve . all right steve , now , follow me .
mom was a nurse &apos;s aid .
the hyena is the ancestor of the horse because it was part of a production called &quot; &quot; faustus in africa , &quot; &quot; a handspring production from 1995 , where it had to play draughts with helen of troy .
( laughter ) people have used it to magnify pulsing veins in their hands .
( applause )
but , if we put money into the core budget , we know that there aren &apos;t the budget systems with integrity that mean that money will be well spent .
our borrowing costs were skyrocketing , and we were facing possible default .
and the red cross too is training volunteers and twitter is certifying them , not simply to supplement existing government institutions , but in many cases , to replace them .
and he &apos;ll do that hundreds and hundreds of times .
it &apos;s not about selling soap , it &apos;s about making sure that in the process of doing so you can change people &apos;s lives .
she was actually coming out of an amnesty international meeting . ( laughter )
mri is using magnetic fields and radio frequencies to scan the brain , or any part of the body .
and he also told me about young japanese-americans during the second world war .
you know , we can make ozone from car tailpipes .
but if there &apos;s a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there , and you make them small enough , and we won &apos;t see them either . that is true .
in fact , you can &apos;t even take the name of the country for granted , because the name &quot; &quot; india &quot; &quot; comes from the river indus , which flows in pakistan .
but i do have to be concerned with those things .
( digital hum and whistling sound ) the ( whistles ) is frogs at home , don &apos;t pay attention to that .
in tuscaloosa , at the university of alabama , there &apos;s an organization on campus called , kind of menacingly , the machine , and it draws from largely white sororities and fraternities on campus , and for decades , the machine has dominated student government elections .
what do you think that fan &apos;s experience is going to be when we take the video footage of an adrian peterson bursting through the line , shedding a tackler with a stiff-arm before sprinting in for a touchdown ? what do you think that fan &apos;s experience
and don &apos;t console yourself that you are the 99 percent .
and the supreme court justices wrestled with that question .
as leah , one of the founders of the group , says , &quot; &quot; i like traditional music very much .
and i said , &quot; &quot; you know what ? these apples come from your ancestors , and your ancestors gave them the greatest honor they could give them .
and that gets you all the scientific data that goes with it .
and dysphoria refers to a feeling of agitation or unease .
they want a say in decisions that are made in their name and with their money . it &apos;s this democratization of information that i think is an information enlightenment , and it has many of the same principles of the first enlightenment .
twelve years ago , i was a fresh graduate seeking my way in the world .
there are very few young infants because they die — high mortality rate — and there &apos;s very few old people .
over 20,000 economists whose job it is , competitive entry to get there , couldn &apos;t see what was happening .
i want to do that too — &quot; &quot; oh ! oh ! &quot; &quot; and all of that .
if in the islamic revolution , the images of the woman portrayed were submissive and didn &apos;t have a voice , now we saw a new idea of feminism in the streets of tehran — women who were educated , forward thinking , non-traditional , sexually open , fearless and seriously feminist .
cp : i stuck that thread so it lasted a few days .
so we &apos;ll release the findings this september for the first time , and then next year , we &apos;ll poll again , and we &apos;ll take the additive step this time of ranking the 1,000 largest u.s. companies from number one to number 1,000 and everything in between .
child : there is no difference here between classes , nor white or black , nor if you have money or not .
( laughter ) and then there are others that are about people .
he said , ok , we &apos;re going to start having these meetings .
but in order to sustain the horizontal line — because these are the projects , these are the systems that we will deliver — we need to also develop the vertical line : system sustenance , high-level education , research and development , industries , technologies , to produce these technologies for application , and finally markets .
and we can &apos;t keep cutting down rain forests for it .
in the process of becoming a supernova , the interior of the star collapses under its own weight and it starts rotating ever faster , like an ice skater when pulling their arms in close to their body .
( applause ) thank you .
but also here is another idea we have — is an intercollegiate exchange program where you have students going from new york abroad .
the stasi also shadowed tens of thousands of people using specially trained agents and secret cameras to document every step one took .
hala simply could no longer cope .
now , it &apos;s not that chemicals are not important in psychiatric disorders .
and i hope you all take part .
and addressing these non-obvious core issues became a key part of the program .
right here , in my city of rio , in spite of mandatory voting , almost 30 percent of the voting population chose to either annul their votes or stay home and pay a fine in the last mayoral elections .
or do i smell some doubt in the room ?
number two , there &apos;s power in promiscuous thinking .
i think they are a cancer of the soul .
it &apos;s a lobster made of playdough that &apos;s afraid of the dark .
we &apos;re seeing them in the beaufort sea , floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out .
and this omission , he said , led to seeing people , and people starting to see themselves , within the categories of the bureaucracies and the institutions .
other outcomes include long-term stalking , even after the abuser remarries ; denial of financial resources ; and manipulation of the family court system to terrify the victim and her children , who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend unsupervised time with the man who beat their mother .
is being more sustainble what gives you a higher quality of life ?
♫ to keep on giving ♫ ♫ and forgiving ♫ ♫ aung san suu kyi ♫ ♫ living under house arrest ♫ ♫ for her peaceful protest ♫ ♫ under house arrest ♫ ♫ for her peaceful protest ♫ ♫ when her people asked her for a message ♫ ♫ she said ♫ ♫ if you &apos;re feeling helpless ♫ ♫ help someone ♫ ♫ if you &apos;re feeling helpless ♫ ♫ help someone ♫ ♫ if you &apos;re feeling helpless ♫ ♫ help someone ♫ ♫ if you &apos;re feeling helpless ♫ ♫ help someone ♫ now we know the words , let &apos;s sing . ♫ if you &apos;re feeling helpless ♫ ♫ help someone ♫ ♫ if you &apos;re feeling helpless ♫ ♫ help someone ♫ ♫ if you &apos;re feeling helpless ♫ ♫ help someone ♫ ♫ if you &apos;re feeling helpless ♫ ♫ help someone ♫
so as is the case with simple solutions , oftentimes the answer is right in front of your face , and for us it was levers .
but go on a bit further up the curve , and then we see it flattening out .
you need proteins for muscles , recovery .
the plant also gets smaller .
how many digits are there in your number ?
by doing these kinds of simulations , we want to eradicate or control malaria thousands of times in software before we actually have to do it in real life ; to be able to simulate both the economic trade-offs — how many bed nets versus how much spraying ? — or the social trade-offs — what happens if unrest breaks out ?
by the 1950s , we started connecting all the towns together with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world , the highway system .
because people used to sew and they needed a pin cushion .
i &apos;m not going to talk about that tonight .
so in fact , something we realized , we can &apos;t just use the web , we have to worry about what the underlying infrastructure of the whole thing , is it in fact of a quality that we need ?
so the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires and then your team wins .
and they further learn this through the lack of teachers that look like them .
and the gm kid is swinging higher , they look better , they &apos;re a better student , they don &apos;t have that stuffy nose you need to wipe .
( applause )
so if , in fact , you want to live a life free of regret , there is an option open to you .
i wrote my book , &quot; &quot; our final century , &quot; &quot; as a scientist , just a general scientist . but there &apos;s one respect , i think , in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective , and that &apos;s that it offers an awareness of the immense future .
imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole .
at that age , obviously , i couldn &apos;t express it that way , but i told her i didn &apos;t feel right .
given that it was such a vast civilization , you might expect to find really powerful rulers , kings , and huge monuments glorifying these powerful kings .
take a look at the death rate from breast cancer over time .
so here we have alice in green and bob in red .
this is her cooking teacher .
some of their cases are questionable and some involve threats and violence .
in a way , the static , stone mountain becomes a moving mountain of sand .
so here &apos;s an example of that , also from andrew &apos;s machine learning class .
ec : ... when i was growing up in the &apos; 90s .
some believe that traveling between the two towers will lead you to another dimension — this bridge has been romanticized as such — that the fall from that frees you from all your worries and grief , and the waters below will cleanse your soul .
yeah . i think it &apos;s evolutionary .
but for many years , until the late 1990s , china had an infrastructure disadvantage vis-a-vis india .
i was on academic and disciplinary probation before i hit double digits , and i first felt handcuffs on my wrists when i was 11 years old .
but responses can actually make a huge difference in the poor countries . this is a proposal that has been talked about a lot in europe .
each of them can make changes and they can merge them after the fact even if they didn &apos;t know of each other &apos;s existence beforehand .
eventually , after a period of six months of brutal war and a toll rate of almost 50,000 dead , we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant .
the hum of the engine died .
lc : oh definitely , definitely . i mean , you know , it was interesting , because i spent basically two years hanging out in this city , dongguan , and over that time , you could see immense change in every person &apos;s life : upward , downward , sideways , but generally upward .
and this hasn &apos;t just happened .
it &apos;s just a set of choices that people make .
we need to have black and white and asian and hispanic just to step forward and say , &quot; we are not going to accept that kind of behavior anymore . &quot;
the last piece of the puzzle is understanding how that code controls your battery .
curiosity has also drilled in that red soil and brought up other material .
in winter , exactly the opposite is happening .
he &apos;s trying to determine if where he is on a bit of long now land would appear from down in the valley to be the actual peak of the mountain .
and you are going to have corresponding abnormal neurology .
there were just bad for me .
paradise on earth , again .
hands up if you think poem 2 was written by a human .
and i even loved seeing behind her ; i could see the little teddy bear sitting on the piano behind her in her room .
similarly , when i have an experience that i describe as a lion or a steak , i &apos;m interacting with reality , but that reality is not a lion or a steak .
here &apos;s clive sinclair now launching his color computer .
then i had video projectors that were projecting intermittently onto the spheres .
( laughter ) and you have to say this room hadn &apos;t been tidied up since 1888 .
but our attempts at doing this are crude and blundering compared to the fine-grained specificity of the parasites .
funds for education , for training and for rehabilitation are declining , so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues .
this is a video editing application where all of the controls for manipulating the video are physical .
people bring their own cooker , he attaches a valve and a steam pipe , and now he gives you espresso coffee . ( laughter ) now , this is a real , affordable coffee percolator that works on gas .
there &apos;s a p.r. company called edelman , they do this very interesting survey every year precisely around trust and what people are thinking .
so , zipcar is a company that i founded seven years ago , but it &apos;s an example of something called car sharing .
no sooner was it proposed than reformers in nigeria adopted it , pushed it and published the revenues in the paper .
no one &apos;s really going to bother you . &quot; &quot; so one of the things that i do is i actually look through my server logs very carefully .
you know , in every culture , shamans have been using environments as medicines .
we sit here — you know , think about the ground vehicles , the human scale — what do you see in person ? we need to capture that up close to establish that what it &apos;s like-type experience .
but as i was moving away from the traditional classical repertoire and trying to find new ways of musical expression , i realized that with today &apos;s technological resources , there &apos;s no reason to limit what can be produced at one time from a single string instrument .
your data looks at fatalities . it doesn &apos;t look at serious injury .
and their politics are not entirely unattractive .
most people use chemical fertilizers . but guess what ?
maybe just a little .
now , we cannot achieve perfection , but if we reach for it , then we can achieve excellence .
and i had to overcome my fear of deep water to find this one .
( laughter ) but michael — he puts it off .
he did this in his phd for hundreds of pairs of drugs .
how many people here would say you &apos;re a maker , if you raise your hand ?
whereas the future self wants the present self to save .
i saw a company that had taken seawater and sand , and they were growing a kind of crop that will grow on pure salt water without having to treat it .
when i first heard from ted and chris a few months ago about the possibility of the prize , i was completely floored .
a woman told me , &quot; &quot; when i see a nollywood film , i can relax , i really — i can breathe better . &quot; &quot; there is also another very important thing that i hope will resonate with this audience .
take a skin cell , make it a master pluripotent cell , so you could then make those cells that are relevant to their disease , both to study but potentially to treat .
but this is what helped me see it .
and this brings me to another favorite of mine — i think , because it is just so unusual .
and we can store information that &apos;s film with water and protein .
you have changed the microclimate .
jake barton : so i have to say i did not actually choose those individual samples to make you cry because they all make you cry .
man : some type of extension pole — like what the painters use .
milo : i just really miss my old house , that &apos;s all .
she started crying . she asked me to call her back .
lp : well , i think invention is not enough .
so what if we &apos;re fighting the wrong war , fighting obesity rather than insulin resistance ?
the system is so healthy , it purifies the water .
they got out on the far end , we said , &quot; &quot; fine , don &apos;t worry about it . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s transparent . a certain amount of certainty gives the sense of a non-zero outcome .
( applause ) so amanda , would you please tell us how you lost your arm ?
and as an economist , we can also look at that side of the story .
america still hated the bear and feared it , but all of a sudden , america also wanted to give the bear a great big hug .
incidentally , we see just one octave .
how do we go from the metaphor to something more practical that we can really use every day ?
so what does this personal health system look like , and what new technologies and roles is it going to entail ?
that makes it easier to imagine trading places with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration to that other person .
well now there are potentials of this building to allow the artistic director to actually move into the building without using our architecture .
i care about it deeply .
he thought , &quot; &quot; oh , i can renovate the school .
and i went . i hadn &apos;t bathed in three days .
and this is even more dangerous — well , it &apos;s dangerous again .

if you flush a toilet , your feces will go to the sewage treatment plants , which are sold as assets , not liabilities .
we have reason to be afraid of melting ice caps .
so we will absorb technology as part of us .
( applause )
it surrounds us all the time , just like the air we breathe in this room .
well , giving your voice can change lives .
52 million people die of natural causes each year corresponds , then , to 52 million volumes destroyed .
in my lab in princeton , we bring people to the fmri scanner and we scan their brains while they are either telling or listening to real-life stories .
now , i think it &apos;s fair to say that when people think about state and local economic development , they don &apos;t generally think first about what they &apos;re doing about childcare and early childhood programs .
maybe it &apos;s called ego .
and some of the watches there , attempting to be beautiful and humorous — maybe not attempting , hopefully succeeding .
today we have choices .
so , what do we do ?
here &apos;s the way i like to describe it instead .
i don &apos;t want to advertise them too much ; that &apos;s not the point .
murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling .
for example , you can use the verb &quot; &quot; go &quot; &quot; and the prepositions &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; in a literal , spatial sense .
&quot; &quot; the worlds are the important thing .

meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink .
for all that it is raising hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in the emerging markets , it &apos;s also outsourcing a lot of jobs from the developed western economies .
they recommended that she do some therapy , but after a while she wasn &apos;t feeling better , so the doctors decided to do further tests .
and so i began my quest to find out how i can learn how to weave .
this is a training ground to sort out the regulars from the honors , a reoccurring cycle built to recycle the trash of this system .
the first question is a tortuous path from geology up to rna or something like that — how did that all work ?
this report is our main public report .
this has never been seen before .
the problem is not technology .
this is how i &apos;ve started to think , and this is certainly how i &apos;ve been thinking in the last few months as i &apos;ve been working on the book that will soon be published , as the dangerously , frighteningly over-anticipated follow up to my freakish success .
i started sketching out these plans to make a photo , and i sent it to the wildlife biologist down in okeechobee — this is an endangered bird , so it takes special permission to do .
history was real , cultures were real , but countries were invented .
we have historical records that allow us to know how the ancient greeks dressed , how they lived , how they fought ...
i wasn &apos;t able to portray his story from within , and so i began to search for a new visual language , one which strived to express the ephemeral quality of his spiritual experience .
he &apos;s sitting there .
( laughter ) this is one substitution that i believe all of us , in design management , are guilty of .
so i went into the woods .
how much do i stand to gain from cheating ?
now , it works just like a regular phone .
so you &apos;re going to be able to go like this . ( laughter )
to keep our partners safe , we work to understand the risk of every location and of every shot before it &apos;s happened , building a backup plan if something goes wrong , and making sure we have everything in place before our operations start .
yet as astronomers , we study a wider range of light and we depend on other methods to do that .
there is one project in the california court system right now that so far cost taxpayers two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and i got distracted by it .
and how are we going to understand all this complex information ?
they might say , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve got a bit of nectar . do you want to come and get it ? &quot; &quot; now this is a plant .
it divides the world into abrahamic religions and eastern religion , but that &apos;s not detailed enough .
&quot; i &apos;m thinking about having a child . &quot;
so for 11 years , i conformed .
chris addressed us , the scientists and experts , &quot; &quot; you have to be more pragmatic .
the choice is whether certain facts about humans , or topics , are to be considered taboos , forbidden knowledge , where we shouldn &apos;t go there because no good can come from it , or whether we should explore them honestly .
enter the evidence-based activist , the factivist .
that &apos;s great news . why ?
all of us have to have a commitment to do that .
some extraordinary things about sneakers and data and nike and how they &apos;re all related , possibly , to the future of all online commerce .
it is happening all across the world , in every kind of walk of life , and every kind of career and industry that you can think of .
the zeppelin — this was from a brochure about the zeppelin based , obviously , on the hindenburg .
it &apos;s easy to see leroy getting the check , right ?
and we found that this individual shared a common origin for his dna sequences with neanderthals around 640,000 years ago .
my colleague , debra fischer , founder of the planet hunters project , said that people at the time were saying , &quot; you &apos;re crazy . there &apos;s no way that a computer will miss a signal . &quot;
minutes before the camera was turned on , they approached a palestinian family that was working their land and told them that they have to leave the land , because this land belongs to the jewish settlers .
we &apos;re not playing with each other .
here &apos;s my cousin gwyneth paltrow .
life is not just an anesthetic to make us smile , but to reach out across the abyss of history , to places we have never been , and would have perhaps been , had we not been so lucky .
we don &apos;t have to change the way a single chinese company works if we get cargill to only send sustainable palm oil to china .
and i &apos;d like to begin with a brief bit of history about what we know about brains .
you can imagine the amount of time that it took me to do this to the house and the displeasure of my parents .
the first and possibly the most important thing we can do is very simple : count the number of fruits on every tree .

it seems counter-intuitive to adult learning , but remember , eight-year-olds live in a society where most of the time they are told , don &apos;t do this , you know , don &apos;t touch the whiskey bottle .
it &apos;s as if there &apos;s some schadenfreude there , that we actually take delight in people getting things wrong , so that we can then moan and groan and bitch at them .
so we had the goal , and now we needed to figure out what are the issues , what is broken .
i &apos;ll give you a couple of more examples on irrational decision-making .
( applause )
the one i want to show you — after we get them to make the movies , we have a night where we show the movies to the community .
anybody use my examples ? the sun and the football ?
because the categories tell me how to tell them apart .
so we &apos;ve placed electrodes within this circuit in an area of the brain called the fornix , which is the highway in and out of this memory circuit , with the idea to see if we can turn on this memory circuit , and whether that can , in turn , help these patients with alzheimer &apos;s disease .
what about failure , though ?
now we &apos;re using this chip . and what are we using it for ?
now can you look at that carefully and see if you see the virgin mary ?
when we started our research on stuxnet six months ago , it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was .
their overriding aim for international aid is to strive for a life of dignity for all .
what if we imagined the upper east side with green roofs , and streams winding through the city , and windmills supplying the power we need ?
and then here &apos;s the reconstructed performance now with the timings of the performance .
there is also a big question of ambiguity .
but 4,000 years is not enough to get us back to our last glacial maximum .
and it &apos;s simple risk perception , really .
land masses began to emerge from the surface of the oceans , and another creature thought , &quot; &quot; hey , that looks like a really nice piece of real estate .
you put down your arrowheads and say , &quot; i &apos;d like to trade these arrowheads for finished arrows . i &apos;ll split you 50 / 50 . &quot;
now don &apos;t get me wrong ; i am not against teaching english , all you english teachers out there .
my fear of public speaking , my social anxiety , poof , gone .
it &apos;s doing that based on the content inside the images .
on facebook , on twitter , on google , all sorts of places where millions of people , myself included , were talking about the events and saw images like this , the emotional , poignant image of a baby with &quot; &quot; je suis charlie &quot; &quot; on its wrist .
his slide into criminality was incremental .
we have second- and third-generation fuels that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar , to much higher-value fuels like octane or different types of butanol .
they &apos;re called millennium development goals .
thank you .
how many of you heard that saying that leadership is lonely ?
i did this as an experiment of casting the shadow .
it was a complicated thing , and i &apos;m not pretending it was more simple than it was .
and what i want to show you is that in regenerative medicine , we &apos;ve really shifted away from that idea of taking a bioinert material .
this is a new way to type , on my old , color classic .
we can choose this moment of crisis to ask and answer the big questions of society &apos;s evolution — like , what do we want to be when we grow up , when we move past this bumbling adolescence where we think there are no limits and suffer delusions of immortality ?

the concussion didn &apos;t heal properly , and after 30 days , i was left with symptoms like nonstop headaches , nausea , vertigo , memory loss , mental fog .
because , of course , every technique that you &apos;ve seen here is something that television and film producers have been able to do for the last 50 years .
they were in the lab working , and they saw the work , not as schoolwork , but as their lives .
now where do we go from there ?
and it also supports working-class kids going into indian schools .
there &apos;s an air jet that dries you .
here a community camp just organized by the community themselves , where they find a place , organize volunteers , and then we &apos;ll do our part . you know , check their vision , and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is and then determine what further testing should be done , and then those tests are done by technicians who check for glasses , or check for glaucoma .
it &apos;s as far as you can fly on a regularly scheduled airplane .
what is it that we need to do fundamentally to re-engage in a project , that capital formation is rapid ?
if i were to ask you guys , what do you rely on when you &apos;re looking at somebody and you want to find out if they &apos;re lying ? what cue do you pay attention to ?
we need to spend time now to really protect our right to share this only with people that we want to share this with , because without this , we simply can &apos;t have a free society .
it fine-tunes your brain &apos;s social instincts .
so an exception to this , however , is penalty shootouts .
people say , &quot; &quot; is such and such true ? &quot; &quot; and i &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; hmm , not sure . &quot; &quot; i &apos;ll think about it roughly .
but when nicholas negroponte — and he has spoken about this project a lot , he &apos;s the founder of olpc — came to us about two and a half years ago , there were some clear ideas .
this lifelong capacity for plasticity , for brain change , is powerfully expressed .
maybe justine sacco &apos;s crime was not being as good at it as randy newman .
( laughter ) or a virgin for a sacrifice ?
well , you know , it was beginner french , that i am taking with her , you know .
einstein , can you also sing ?
that day , the first film of a public beheading was created in france .
so , this is a project for nine inch nails .
intolerance , exclusion and revenge became the icons of the &#91; aftermath &#93; of the revolution .
it &apos;s not as sophisticated as the language of the wall street journal .

we had gone hunting for pills but we ended up finding theories .
i saw the structure while i was on the train , and i got off at the next station and met people there that gave me access to their catacomb-like basement , which was used for ammunition storage during the war and also , at some point , to hide groups of jewish refugees .
i went to an online encyclopedia , wikipedia , and i entered the term &quot; &quot; earth . &quot; &quot; you can start anywhere , this time i chose earth .
what kind of a world can we be making ? &quot; &quot; are treated with more and more skepticism , and move off the table .
they &apos;re going to throw some polymer plastic into the bricks , shove them in a microwave oven , and then you will be able to build buildings with really thick walls .
ok ? and you can consider all sorts of different bush meat .
&quot; &quot; um , abed , &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; i thought you had a few driving issues before the crash . &quot;
when you look into it , it &apos;s sort of like looking at cloud patterns , but sometimes they &apos;re very modeled and highly rendered .
he was in dental school , talented , promising ...
we &apos;ll then go to the next paradigm .
well basically that means that this protein is changing from the sensitive cell to the resistant cell .
the grizzly would soon be wiped out from 95 percent of its original territory , and whereas once there had been 30 million bison moving across the plains , and you would have these stories of trains having to stop for four or five hours so that these thick , living rivers of the animals could pour over the tracks , now , by 1902 , there were maybe less than 100 left in the wild .
now the problem is that we &apos;re not thinking about it in very innovative ways .
trash the system or crash the planet — it &apos;s a tough choice ; it isn &apos;t much of a choice .
we took mice and we gave them one p , paroxetine .
it would make a very uplifting world .
that &apos;s an enormous model .
that is because &#91; there &#93; , in georgia , white people and black people are more historically familiar to one another .

i mean , why would anyone think such a crazy thing ?
audience : sex .
i know that i will live with this tragedy , with these multiple tragedies , for the rest of my life .
only unlike the dinosaurs , we can see it coming .

given all of that , mistakes are inevitable .
i think it &apos;s probably 175 billion barrels .
and on top of everything else , bees have their own set of diseases and parasites .

at some point in his wonderful book &quot; the better angels of our nature , &quot; steven pinker says , the old testament says love thy neighbor , and the new testament says love thy enemy , but i don &apos;t love either one of them , not really , but i don &apos;t want to kill them .
he gives them more money for geological data , they come back , they can &apos;t tell him where to go into production .

this is really a change , that you have this lag of more or less 30 , 40 years &apos; difference on the health .
so people that society once considered to be disabled can now become the architects of their own identities and indeed continue to change those identities by designing their bodies from a place of empowerment .
we &apos;ll see two cells in the upper part of the screen attempting to divide .
the computer tells you how to drive — turn left , turn right , speed up , stop .

but if this mclaren were to run into a wall at 65 miles an hour , the entire crash energy would be absorbed by a couple of woven carbon-fiber composite cones , weighing a total of 15 pounds , hidden in the front end .
the character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other .
we need help . we need help .
it &apos;s what is meant by overcoming the horror that we feel when we are under threat of our enemies , and beginning to appreciate the other .
but one of these options is huge , and it has to do with that long-standing question that bothered me as a tiny little kid , about gravity .
i never did anything to anyone that wasn &apos;t .

this is not in what we call the traditional habitable zone , this area around the sun .
this is a big fibroid .
we want to see the whole thing , so let &apos;s inflate it so we can see the whole thing .
what was different this time is the way that the terrorists used modern information communications technologies to locate additional victims and slaughter them .
now when we think of our senses , we don &apos;t usually think of the reasons why they probably evolved , from a biological perspective .
we &apos;re learning more from them than we &apos;re giving them .
you need to always think , what else needs to be discovered ?
we need nothing less than a new green revolution , and the planet boundaries shows that agriculture has to go from a source of greenhouse gases to a sink .
as someone who has spent his entire career trying to be invisible standing in front of an audience is a cross between an out-of-body experience and a deer caught in the headlights , so please forgive me for violating one of the ted commandments by relying on words on paper , and i only hope i &apos;m not struck by lightning bolts before i &apos;m done .
so these black boxes that we live with and take for granted are actually complex things made by other people , and you can understand them .
i have to do a little bit more background reading , but i think this will be the largest amount of force produced by an animal of a given — per body mass . so , really incredible forces .

in hobbesian terms , life is short and brutish there .
but the mayor of london wanted to reintroduce buses with this open platform .
now , when looked at this , it changed the way i see things , because this thing , this network that &apos;s changing across time , it has a memory , it moves , things flow within it , it has a kind of consistency — people can die , but it doesn &apos;t die ; it still persists — and it has a kind of resilience that allows it to persist across time .
mau passed away five months ago , but his legacy and lessons live on .
and there is a front between them , and the front moves .
my green &#91; unclear &#93; 25,000 pounds of vegetables , i &apos;m growing organic citizens , engaged kids .
they play this major role in shaping and maintaining the structure and diversity of the forest , and for that reason , tapirs are known as gardeners of the forest .
because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow , and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye as the one outside the shadow , it would have to be more reflective — just the laws of physics .
and the question is , who do you want to remember — if you had just 45 minutes with your grandmother ?
they last for about five miles , in which case we put our foot back on the pedal .
it was a very big bang .
and i didn &apos;t have one !

perhaps you can hear it in the words i &apos;m speaking even now .
well first of all , it &apos;s because we can read it , which is fantastic .
and in the mean time , personal savings absolutely plummeted .
if you work on two neurons , that &apos;s psychology . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) we have to have more theory , and it can come as much from the top down .
or what if that very same robotic arm could refuel the propellant tank on a spacecraft that relies on chemical propulsion just like you or i would refuel the fuel tanks on our cars ?
that &apos;s their house .
and that usually refers to if a young person , specifically often a young woman , is old enough to have pubic hair , she &apos;s old enough to have sex with .

i watch that tv show &apos; lie to me . &apos; i know you &apos;re lying . &quot; &quot; no , liespotters are armed with scientific knowledge of how to spot deception .
but also , technology has helped to write new pages of our history , or at least to update pages of our histories .

the growing colony of bacteria that you see here is about the width of a human hair .
so the red line is mostly below that curve and indeed there &apos;s only one point that is achieved with the needle that &apos;s protective , and that &apos;s with a high dose of 6,000 nanograms .
so people didn &apos;t even recognize the disease , people who knew ebola .
or a powerless lover , watching with infinite compassion things god is unable to control or change ?
that may not sound like much , but when added up over the whole world , it &apos;s enormous .
magic can be taught . magic can be taught .
i &apos;m saying that the capacity for self-transcendence is just a basic part of being human .
and then this question of uselessness .
this is what your contacts list would look like if i were examining it .
and my brain , thanks to my parents , has been activated to form images in my visual cortex , which we now call the imaging system , from those patterns of information , much as your brain does .
well , the heart stent came from that little blow-up box that you might have learned in elementary school .
you , yeah , yeah . okay , he &apos;s hungry .
but now for the good news !

everything is grist for the mill — except hem lengths .
ask yourself where you learned to assign the meaning of wrong or abnormal to doing many things .
now , out of all the places that do better than the u.s. in reading , how many of them have a formal system for helping teachers improve ?
by now , these thoughtful , opinionated , curious young people thought nothing of tackling films of all forms — black and white , subtitled , documentary , non-narrative , fantasy — and thought nothing of writing detailed reviews that competed to favor one film over another in passionate and increasingly sophisticated prose .
they would not email you back ( laughter ) — but you &apos;d get an automated reply . ( laughter )

( laughter ) the three friends and the stranger , even though the stranger didn &apos;t have any extra information , even though it was just a case of how that changed the conversation to accommodate that awkwardness , the three friends and the stranger , they had a 75 percent chance of finding the right answer .
that &apos;s what &apos;s in fields around the world every single year .
so they &apos;re not a donation .
and so , just the initial lift off from sugarloaf to cross the atlantic , as we were pushing into the jet stream , this enormous balloon — the top of the balloon ended up going at a couple of hundred miles an hour , the capsule that we were in at the bottom was going at maybe two miles an hour , and it just took off .
they are not luxuries .
and hopefully if we understand how we control movement , we can apply that to robotic technology .
what is seen goes in .
( applause )
two of the known applications for this material include interior design and multi-touch systems .
we need to build an arsenal of noncombative weapons in this war on terrorism .
maybe even just calling it that for some of these people would allow them to stop imagining trying to imagine a trauma that didn &apos;t really happen in order to explain a feeling that really is happening .
which is why i say it &apos;s a social justice issue .
thank you .
they vote with these chemical votes , the vote gets counted , and then everybody responds to the vote .
i was pleased to read it . chris went on to say that he &apos;d been influenced by my writings in what he did .

and at the beginning , we were so touched by these stories , we were so amazed by these stories , that we thought that maybe the best way to talk to the guerrillas was to have them talk to themselves , so we recorded about a hundred different stories during the first year , and we put them on the radio and television so that the guerrillas in the jungle could hear stories , their stories , or stories similar to theirs , and when they heard them , they decided to go out .
right ? ( laughter ) doesn &apos;t it sound like something you need to go into hospital ?
it &apos;s one of those things .
sp : but surely antiwar movements depended on mass demonstrations and catchy tunes by folk singers and wrenching photographs of the human costs of war .

mg : so we went to tanzania .
so , what the world needs now is a new type of sign .
think , temes spreading because they must .

and in the years that i &apos;ve been , and we &apos;ve all been campaigning and investigating , i &apos;ve repeatedly seen that what makes corruption on a global , massive scale possible , well it isn &apos;t just greed or the misuse of power or that nebulous phrase &quot; &quot; weak governance . &quot; &quot; i mean , yes , it &apos;s all of those , but corruption , it &apos;s made possible by the actions of global facilitators .
not a single kid that i went to college with has a criminal record right now .
it would allow us to avail ourselves of the use of autonomous vehicles and drones while still preserving our open , civil society .
you remember carlos ?
this is like odysseus when he &apos;s hearing the song .
and he says , the link to one site didn &apos;t just grow on the other page &quot; &quot; like a tree fungus . &quot; &quot; and in fact , i think that &apos;s not entirely true anymore .
and we called it a studio school to go back to the original idea of a studio in the renaissance where work and learning are integrated .
first of all , you &apos;re going to pick up an analog device : a pen .
and i think , as my goals , i always go back to gandhi &apos;s talisman .
it &apos;s interesting because he rejected the aristotelian premise underlying the majority &apos;s opinion .
it became enormous in just a few months .
so this email inspired me to dive into genealogy , which i always thought was a very staid and proper field , but it turns out it &apos;s going through a fascinating revolution , and a controversial one .
and the trick that richard dawkins does , which is to say , to look at them as simply as genes , as vehicles for genes .
and the thing you really hope for is occasionally they burn up , which we won &apos;t see tonight . so .
and the same time , he is sending a mental message to the second rat that didn &apos;t see any light , and the second rat , in 70 percent of the times is going to press the left lever and get a reward without ever experiencing the light in the retina .
one out of every five medicare dollars get spent on alzheimer &apos;s .
thank you very much .
so this is the athena breast health network . it &apos;s a study of 150,000 women in california , and they &apos;re going to return all the data to the participants of the study in a computable form , with one-clickability to load it into the study that i &apos;ve put together . so we &apos;ll know exactly how many people are willing to be unreasonable .
so we have to protect that legacy and be an example .
so was my family , who started looking for me in hospitals , police stations and even morgues .
and this pushes innovation in money out to the edges , where it belongs .
we think there &apos;s a simpler solution to this problem — one that can be used by people who face conditions like this everyday .
and i often look at things as though they &apos;re food .
the fire suits of old , the bulky suits , the thick woolen suits , have been replaced with modern materials like nomex or , more recently , carbonex — fantastic materials that enable us as stunt professionals to burn for longer , look more spectacular , and in pure safety .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
first it starts with the sexual organs , then it starts with cuss words , then it was bush slanders and then people actually got to art .
they &apos;re the reason you have electricity , heat , clean water , food .
it &apos;s coming from the economists imposing their mechanistic thinking on the science .
i sometimes have the idea that nuclear explosions are about to be set off in my brain .
that was a trip .
that would be like getting hungry at night and having to flip through the whole phone book from cover to cover , pausing at every line , just to find the nearest pizza joint .
thank you .
it &apos;s the fact of poor migrant women selling sex specifically that has some feminists uncomfortable .
i want to talk about social innovation and social entrepreneurship .
so that goes along with the chesire cat saying , &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t care much where you want to get to , it doesn &apos;t much matter which way you go . &quot; &quot; but i think it does matter which way we go , and what road we take , because when i think about design in the near future , what i think are the most important issues , what &apos;s really crucial and vital is that we need to revitalize the arts and sciences right now in 2002 .
but on the edge of town , one elderly lady , a charwoman in the charnel ground , saw a jeweled foot on a jeweled lotus on his shoulder and then the dog , but she saw the jewel foot of the maitreya , and she offered a flower .
i need people to understand what the reality in the west bank looks like .
and when we calculated we thought we &apos;re never going to make it around the world at that speed .
you will not play at the casino with the resources that people have entrusted you with .
america today is a sprightly young body , hit by one of those strokes that sucks the life from one side , while leaving the other worryingly perfect .
think about that &apos;s where we are right now , and the curve that we &apos;re on means that this is going to continue to get better .
well linguistic scripts can actually encode multiple languages .
lt : no .
just right , you &apos;re creative , and yet you don &apos;t fall for too much baloney .
we have a dentist — she &apos;s a grandmother , illiterate , who &apos;s a dentist .
the problem is that current prosthetics don &apos;t work very well . they &apos;re still very limited in the vision that they can provide .
and that refers to feeding information into the brain via unusual sensory channels , and the brain just figures out what to do with it .
you can buy cuecas baratas , designer underwear that isn &apos;t really manufactured by a designer , and even pirated evangelical mixtapes . ( laughter ) now , businesses tend to complain about this , and their , they , i don &apos;t want to take away from their entire validity of complaining about it , but i did ask a major sneaker manufacturer earlier this year what they thought about piracy , and they told me , &quot; &quot; well , you can &apos;t quote me on this , because if you quote me on this , i have to kill you , &quot; &quot; but they use piracy as market research .
thank you so much .
so maybe we could activate or inactive memories by just using light — xl : that &apos;s pretty fast .
so i would urge you to really learn about these types of technologies , because , really , only in that way are we going to be able to guide the development of these technologies , the use of these technologies and make sure that , in the end , it &apos;s a positive outcome — for both the planet and for us .
you see , he has established the largest retail chain , called big bazaar .
in the 1970s , the turnover of the red brigades on a yearly basis was seven million dollars .
i remembered an old man yelling to us and crying to help us get him up .
here i have a very complicated , messy , confused idea in my head .
so i was positive that , if somehow we can make things mimic life , let &apos;s go one step further .
we talk about what still has to get done , what &apos;s so critical to get done in the lab .
now , in lebanon , we have one refugee per three lebanese .
they &apos;ll be able to focus their hearing , they &apos;ll be able to increase the sensitivity , decrease the sensitivity , do a series of things that we can &apos;t do .
you may not come near me !
and he died when the ambulance was coming to the hospital to take him .
several people heard about this story , and so they contacted me because they wanted to pay the $ 2,500 debt .
search out the companies that are acting on this .
but in all seriousness , because this idea is birthed in ted , i would like it to be a legacy of ted , and i &apos;d like to call it the &quot; &quot; international system for total early disease detection . &quot; &quot; &#91; instedd &#93; and instedd then becomes our mantra .
this is my last map .
as difficult as it is to see , homo sapiens , that is humans , evolves every day , and still continues to evolve .
and i of course knew stuff , as a designer , about typography , even though we worked with those animals not so successfully .
but for that , we already have the training manuals , which are approved by the ministry and moreover , this approach is now part of the mental health strategy in afghanistan .
for strength and lightness , the dome structure used five rings of coffers , each of diminishing size , which imparts a dramatic forced perspective to the design .
which was three minutes longer than i had prepared .
robotics systems are just incredible these days , absolutely incredible .
and actually , our political beliefs also can affect the way we see other people , including politicians .
violated by this conductor again ?
their involvement reduces the cost .
last year at ted i gave an introduction to the lhc .
people will see my tag , and they &apos;ll see &quot; &quot; the war tapes , &quot; &quot; and then we &apos;ll start talking about war .
what if obesity isn &apos;t the cause of insulin resistance at all ?
this is another subject that comes in place , and this is a prediction .
pm : and when you arrived at the hospital , what was the prognosis that they gave you about gabby &apos;s condition and what recovery , if any , you could expect ?
this pill also — millions of people have taken it , the company did studies , the fda looked at it — all good .
and i said , &quot; &quot; oh . &quot; &quot; because those had been in the news lately .
a somatic cell , a body cell , was taken from its body , gestated in the ovum of a cow , and then that cow gave birth to a guar .
now , i don &apos;t know exactly where it &apos;s going , but i &apos;ve got a bit of effort involved in this thing .
but obviously , there wasn &apos;t a lot i could do about it .
it hurts me , too .
it &apos;s the president of harvard . it &apos;s 1871 .
and that &apos;s the ability to exploit opposing ideas and opposing constraints to create new solutions .
but if that &apos;s it and that becomes the reason that renewables don &apos;t get invested in , then , long-term , we &apos;re screwed anyway , right ?
helping africa is noble .
i buried some of our new vehicle engines , i buried it to save it .
we can run the score up against anybody , and then get our asses kicked in the second half — what they call fourth generation warfare .
and everything looks normal except the children &apos;s faces .
so does that mean we have nothing to worry about ?
to get rid of nuclear weapons and to end the supply of the materials required to produce them , some experts tell me would take 30 years .
national rating at that time , national rating , the aids and the tuberculosis &#91; rating &#93; , was always on the top 10 list for zip codes for cities across the nation , or just zip codes across the nation .
the bad news is that &apos;s not true .
now , obviously i can &apos;t do all of them , so a few highlights for you : the highest ranked g7 country is canada .
( laughter ) you know that all of the cool people are — they &apos;re doing it .
this child matters .
you &apos;ll find out why it &apos;s called a bristlecone pine . a little sensory experience .
and what i &apos;ve found is that the process of designing and building electronics is problematic in all sorts of ways .
would they give me academic journals so i could scribble in the margins ?
the recent wars in iraq and afghanistan have produced , thank god , a casualty rate about one third of what it was in vietnam .
but back then , we noticed that detail and we fixed it , and now everyone else does that as well .
now , we basically have to change our views slightly .
and so , to my great surprise , i found that going nowhere was at least as exciting as going to tibet or to cuba .
so if you were thinking of buying an ipad , forget about it . this is what you want instead .
the majority of our functional brain is distributed over the outer surface layer of the brain , and to increase the area that &apos;s available for mental capacity , the brain surface is highly folded .
warren berger says that design thinking teaches us to look sideways , to reframe , to refine , to experiment and , probably most importantly , ask those stupid questions .
and then the skin — the edges of this — all promote the dynamic , the movement of the building as a series of seismic shifts , geologic shifts . right ?
it is ourselves we are helping .
this is now the largest crowd-funded science project that we know of — over 8,000 people have signed up at this point .
i couldn &apos;t understand the starvation , the destruction , the killing of innocent people .
actually , i &apos;m even here speaking as a middle class white man .
so last october , in gentleman scholar tradition , i put the entire collection online as &quot; &quot; museum of four in the morning . &quot; &quot; you can click on that red &quot; &quot; refresh &quot; &quot; button .
so let &apos;s look at this ceiling and see storytelling gone global .
the doors can actually swap out , so you can actually put on a rigid panel with a window unit in it for climate control , or a connector module that would allow you to actually connect multiple units together , which gives you larger and kind of compartmentalized living spaces , so now this same kit of parts , this same unit can actually serve as a living room , bedroom or bathroom , or an office , a living space and secure storage .
and that was to recognize that when you sit around the table , the actual location of the people becomes rather important .
so last year , on the fourth of july , experiments at the large hadron collider discovered the higgs boson .
but he &apos;s an absolute genius when it comes to design .
on the weekend , your choice .
my phone is a slot machine .
we &apos;re looking for images that shine an uncompromising light on crucial issues , images that transcend borders , that transcend religions , images that provoke us to step up and do something — in other words , to act .
and the scarcity of resources for dealing with these problems is only growing , certainly in the advanced world today , with all the fiscal problems we face .
it pours out millions of gallons every hour , and supplies drinking water to at least 300 million people , and washes many , many babies , and of course feeds many , many animals , both domestic and wild , produces thousands of tons of rice .
it starts of with the very small ones , which are one carbon , four hydrogen — that &apos;s methane — it just floats off .
social relations and exchange become significantly more important than they ever were as an economic phenomenon . in some contexts , it &apos;s even more efficient because of the quality of the information , the ability to find the best person , the lower transaction costs . it &apos;s sustainable and growing fast .
and something about it just kind of drew me towards it .
we were surrounded by thousands of acres of cotton fields .
it &apos;s titled , &quot; &quot; an american index of the hidden and unfamiliar , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s comprised of nearly 70 images .
my early canvases ended up being things that you wouldn &apos;t expect to be used as canvas , like fried food .
so what is the air ?
the rules are like the notes on the page , and that gets you started , but then you dance around the notes on the page , coming up with just the right combination for this particular moment with this particular set of fellow players .
well you might have , but i don &apos;t think so .
i &apos;m not supposed to care when black youth are harassed by police , because my white-looking jewish kids probably won &apos;t ever get pulled over for the crime of driving while black .
in fact , one of the things that i did just for amusement purposes is we can now write things in this code .
now i have done the impossible not once , but many times .
and this is a completely different song .
we think a lot of good can come from this technology .
it &apos;s kind of a well-kept secret .
we need to stop shouting and start talking .
let me quickly give you three examples of startups that personally inspire me .
it &apos;s actually emitting ultrasound — low-level ultrasound — that &apos;s about 100,000 vibrations per second .
now harry butler , who most australians would know is a famous naturalist , had spent a lot of time in the marine environment .
the people who received this message showed a marked decrease in energy consumption simply by being told what their neighbors were doing .
for so many years we have fed on aid .
this man was in an ngo feeding center , being helped as much as he could be helped .
but the point is that when i was first in gombe in 1960 — i remember so well , so vividly , as though it was yesterday — the first time , when i was going through the vegetation , the chimpanzees were still running away from me , for the most part , although some were a little bit acclimatized — and i saw this dark shape , hunched over a termite mound , and i peered with my binoculars .
and tennis is global .
we don &apos;t talk about that as men .
so he &apos;s really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today .
and in subsequent climbs they could never find that ant again , and so no specimens have ever been collected .
they are often the precursor to bigger things .
what are we to do ? we are faced with a paradox .
but the age of empires is gone .
i see it everywhere .
and so it is not any one stripe or something that tells me i have a virus of a particular type here ; it &apos;s the barcode that in bulk represents the whole thing .
and he was kept there by the owner &apos;s calm insistence .
above 50,000 feet you need a space suit , a pressure suit .
the picture behind me was snapped by the copilot in our chase aircraft just moments after the wheels got off the ground for the first time .
but at the same time , it &apos;s my responsibility to teach a large course to undergraduates on the brain , and that &apos;s a big subject , and it takes quite a while to organize that , and it &apos;s quite challenging and it &apos;s quite interesting , but i have to say , it &apos;s not so exhilarating .
if you live up here , in summer the sun is coming fairly directly down , but in winter it &apos;s coming through a huge amount of atmosphere , and much of the ultraviolet is weeded out , and the range of wavelengths that hit the earth are different from summer to winter .
the other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently when you have very few ophthalmologists ?
and that urbanization is extraordinary , accelerated pace .
here we are . unfortunately , i can &apos;t show you a picture of this symmetrical object .
and the third is the focusing illusion , and it &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about any circumstance that affects well-being without distorting its importance .
i want to talk to you about one of the biggest myths in medicine , and that is the idea that all we need are more medical breakthroughs and then all of our problems will be solved .
this is a real challenge to do this , because animals , when you start to really look inside them — how they work — appear hopelessly complex . there &apos;s no detailed history of the design plans , you can &apos;t go look it up anywhere .
this is probably a fairly small piece of mathematica code that &apos;s able to be run here .
bruce bueno de mesquita : i &apos;ve thought about that , and since i &apos;ve done a lot of work for the intelligence community , they &apos;ve also pondered that .
when i first realized that we had no option as scientists but to use much-vilified livestock to address climate change and desertification , i was faced with a real dilemma .
there is some danger , there is some trap . one trap : the vertical .
it is unimaginably small .
so it turns out there &apos;s a keyboard shortcut that lets you jump directly to the beep like this .
i don &apos;t really see it , i don &apos;t pay attention to it until there &apos;s , you know , like a bug that &apos;s dead on the window .
thank you very much .
i want to stay out of the way .
and it got worse , not better .
and yet , i would like to think that i am more than my genes .
if you look at most of the world &apos;s major religions , you will find seekers — moses , jesus , buddha , muhammad — seekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness , where they then have profound epiphanies and revelations that they then bring back to the rest of the community .
what i &apos;ve shown you here is sometimes called a major transition in evolutionary history .
and you &apos;re still learning who you are .
sp : but can reason lead us in directions that are good or decent or moral ?
and it &apos;s a great thing actually that nobody &apos;s had to think about it here today because it means that we can take this for granted .
here &apos;s a time lapse of one of the time-lapse units being made .
what will that lead to ?
( video ) dr. jason topping : my name is jason topping .
so i approached my phd supervisor , professor rachel calam , with the idea of using my academic skills to make some change in the real world .
you get an algorithm that you can program in a binary code , and that &apos;s the defining trait of the computer program .
we dropped them gently in .
here we go .
so nowadays , everyone could produce his mono product .
and here is my beloved briefcase , also rescued from that morning .
it &apos;s very difficult to be healthy on a planet where we &apos;ve poisoned the earth and the sea and the air .
and that was no coincidence .
with aculab and patientslikeme , we &apos;re aiming to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals .
the staircase takes us from the experience of life as profane or ordinary upwards to the experience of life as sacred , or deeply interconnected .
now here &apos;s a conference in which people talk about the future , and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000 .
i mean , all of the ballroom dance geeking out that we had always done on why salsa worked differently than the competitive rumba and why tango traveled unlike the waltz , all of that just hit the public consciousness , and it changed everything .
now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid .
it gets even worse than that . let me just walk you through this one .
these guys are all shrinking , the power is all drifting out here , so the outcome is going to be the weapons-grade fuel .
and that &apos;s what you see in the last rose bowl , you know , when we entered one of the floats .
and that &apos;s important for many fronts , and one of them is because of that culture that &apos;s in agriculture .
but in the 1970s , the energy crisis struck , and customers started thinking about how to save energy .
let me turn the trails on , so you can see that a little bit better .
deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes , those brain cells die , they never come back .
the solidarity of millions of yemenis across the country just demanding the one thing .
so this photograph was taken last month by ryan with an iphone .
we could understand it here , though .
yeah , good .
paul ? come on , stand up .
it &apos;s more profound than that .
so there &apos;s about 86 billion neurons in our brain .
and what he showed me and what he can show all of us , i think , is that the great thing for chefs , the great blessing for chefs , and for people that care about food and cooking , is that the most ecological choice for food is also the most ethical choice for food .
in 1998 , the people of indonesia took to the streets and overthrew their longtime dictator , suharto .
( laughter ) ( applause ) now , in three short years , we &apos;ve come a long way with stand-up comedy shows happening even in saudi arabia .
at these large-scale construction sites in china , you see a sort of makeshift camp where workers live during the entire building process .
anyway , so the biggest thing that &apos;s invisible to us is what we don &apos;t know .
then i saw our chancellor coming to school in denims and turtlenecks , and thought , it &apos;s not right for me to keep this other &#91; rule &#93; so i let them just — they had to be neat and clean .
and i want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands , great mothers , friends , daughters , sons .
and what happened next was that i entered this state of pure , unprejudiced amazement .
video : don blankenship : let me be clear about it . al gore , nancy pelosi , harry reid , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations .
well , actually , it is .
and we built a probability map of where they might have been .
and because it &apos;s easy for the buyer to change allegiance whenever they want , the only way of trusting a vendor is if they have a good history of positive feedback from other users of the site .
so the temperature required for fusion is 150 billion degrees c.
that was a big deal ; that was important . he worked for kodak for a while ; that was important .
this often creates a good cop / bad cop dynamic in which the copy editor — i &apos;ll use that as an umbrella term — is invariably the bad cop .
main result is that there is tremendous confusion .
well , not exactly everyone , because the u.s. intelligence only has a legal right to monitor foreigners .
when i was just about to give everything up after years of suffering , i started to rediscover the true power of music .
what they haven &apos;t been so good about instructing people is the problem of darkly pigmented people living in high latitude areas , or working inside all the time .
essilor stays ahead of its game , and has delivered spectacular performance for over 40 years , by using the principles of prudence and adaptation .
a poetic image for a story on tolstoy , by sam abell .
right now , we don &apos;t really have a bead on that .
( laughter ) but the truth is that i had a very happy childhood , full of laughter and love , in a very close-knit family .
they &apos;re easy , they &apos;re cheap , because instead of making places , we &apos;re making memories of places .
so it can actually hold itself in very strong currents , as you see here .
we got a lot of people thinking about electric cars , what you could do with them . a few years later , when we suggested to gm that now is the time and we could do a thing called the impact , they sponsored it , and here &apos;s the impact that we developed with them on their programs . this is the demonstrator . and they put huge effort into turning it into a commercial product .
and she &apos;s just turned 18 .
thelma nichols : inmate number 0b2472 .
the head nurse told me proudly , &quot; you see , our children are very well-behaved . &quot;

he &apos;s coming up to one of my graduate students and flipper patting , which he would do to a female penguin .
and then i pasted huge posters everywhere in the bourgeois area of paris with the name , age , even building number of these guys .
i had nothing to offer and no one had anything to offer me .
if you were not , you maybe had to go through an operator .
now it turns out , in the mathematics , you can put it in as a term that &apos;s an energy , but it &apos;s a completely different type of energy from anything we &apos;ve ever seen before .
that so many of the city &apos;s most venerable taxpayers have survived yet another commercial building boom , is cause for celebration .
he &apos;d be torn apart by the bitter divisiveness of sectarianism .
and we just put these two together in the same system .
but what are you going to do with a flat track pad , those square things ?
it &apos;s a beard trimmer , you see ?
now , i know that &apos;s a dirty word for some people , but we evolved from common ancestors with the gorillas , the chimpanzee and also the bonobos .
he said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot; &quot; and i have to tell you , it was energizing .
but if you consider the green part of the brain stem , nothing like that happens .
so , i started collecting found objects .
but why are there so many orphans in europe when there hasn &apos;t been a great deal of war or disaster in recent years ?
it &apos;s not an equally great answer and my reply to that is usually , &quot; &quot; try to google the word &apos; search engine , &apos; you may find a couple of interesting alternatives . &quot; &quot; and last but not least , thirdly , inevitably , one student will raise her or his hand and say , &quot; with google , i &apos;m certain to always get the best , unbiased search result . &quot;
what is the real thing that you should be afraid of ?
i learned very few things in addition since ( laughter ) — but made a whole number of them into projects since .
these are the 15 commodities that fundamentally pose the biggest threats to these places because of deforestation , soil loss , water use , pesticide use , over-fishing , etc .
with this factory and 100,000 planes a year , we could make all of america &apos;s electricity in about 10 years .
the ability to make and test models has become essential , not only to every single area of science today , but also to modern society itself .
we happened to win , just recently , the green product of the year for &quot; &quot; the re-invention of drywall , &quot; &quot; from popular science .
it &apos;s the essence of the design process .
but the one thing that i always looked forward to was playing around with my cousins .
again , not a single one of them — i think there are about seven or eight of them — thought this would do any good . they thought this was a temporary change .
but that didn &apos;t happen .
so , solving the problem of pollution with more pollution .
in other words , we &apos;re raising our girls to be perfect , and we &apos;re raising our boys to be brave .
this is dave clearing the airspace with the faa for 15 miles .
and if we really want to get out of this economic mess , if we really want high performance on those definitional tasks of the 21st century , the solution is not to do more of the wrong things , to entice people with a sweeter carrot , or threaten them with a sharper stick .
but it changes fundamentally our governance and management paradigm , from the current linear , command and control thinking , looking at efficiencies and optimization towards a much more flexible , a much more adaptive approach , where we recognize that redundancy , both in social and environmental systems , is key to be able to deal with a turbulent era of global change .
and it &apos;s that choice that i want to focus on , because as we migrate lethal decision-making from humans to software , we risk not only taking the humanity out of war , but also changing our social landscape entirely , far from the battlefield .
another example is a group of designers who were working on a surgical instrument with some surgeons .
all right . very good . about half .
so — and that &apos;s a song about how everybody &apos;s miserable because , you know , we &apos;re from russia .
i have to tell it , because there was no one to put two and two together .

this is scary because when the economy doesn &apos;t grow , our children don &apos;t get better lives .
we can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours .
many barriers are breaking down .
actually no generator is 24 / 7 . they all break .
i know how it can look really bad .
he told me to stop , take my backpack off and put my hands on the police car parked next to us .
i was here , planting my chunks , cutting up potatoes and planting it , and the bees were working on this tree ; bumblebees , just making this thing vibrate .
and you can show , just by looking at data from literature , that vector-borne diseases are more harmful than non-vector-borne diseases .
it wasn &apos;t until i entered high school that i thought , &quot; &quot; maybe now , you know — being a big high school kid — i can maybe become an active part of this big medical world . &quot; &quot; i was 14 , and i emailed professors at the local university to see if maybe i could go work in their lab . and hardly anyone responded .
we don &apos;t like to give up our special-ness , so , you know , having the idea that robots could really have emotions , or that robots could be living creatures — i think is going to be hard for us to accept .
and he turned to my mother , and he said , &quot; &quot; you haven &apos;t told her yet ? &quot; &quot; on my seventeenth birthday , as janis ian would best say , i learned the truth at 17 .
his photo was remembered by all of us .
so because of having cooked food , it &apos;s easier to digest .
we have zero infrastructure .
i &apos;ve been temporarily detained .
now just like the physical maps of our world that have been highly influenced by technology — think google maps , think gps — the same thing is happening for brain mapping through transformation .
so there &apos;s something about aging that &apos;s kind of universal .
aerial images could also be processed to produce three-dimensional computer models of forests .
but anyway , the cops down at the precinct charged chuck with receiving stolen property .
we see rocks .
you &apos;ve got to think , and i &apos;m going to ask you some questions .
to understand even something as important to us as happiness , you kind of have to branch off in all these different directions , and there &apos;s nowhere that i &apos;ve discovered — other than ted — where you can ask that many questions in that many different directions .
edward snowden shined a light on an important need that people had to understand .
and even stranger , there were these people , these beekeepers , that loved their bees like they were family , and when i put down the book , i knew i had to see this for myself .
another world is possible .
so some solutions to heat can provide for win-win-wins .
i had a rigorous scientific transect .
gas is a similar issue . gas is also a biological product . and as you think of gas , well , you &apos;re familiar with gas . and here &apos;s a different way of mining coal .
the object itself just means nothing .
and sure enough , if you sit down , and you analyze all this data on spaghetti sauce , you realize that all americans fall into one of three groups .
all the little details — the curb return radius .
( applause ) increasingly in developed countries , women are socialized to believe that our place is no longer only in the home , but men are actually still where they always were .
he reached down . he pulled a lever . and the chair sank down .
now , a lot of parents , when they adopt , actually want to erase their children &apos;s history .
in brazil , they are usually first sent to governmental triage facilities , in which most of the cases , the conditions are as bad as with the traffickers .
seven to one is the ratio , they tend to say .
lucky me .
one way of describing the plutocrats is as alpha geeks , and they are people who are acutely aware of how important highly sophisticated analytical and quantitative skills are in today &apos;s economy .
so why does good sex so often fade ?
we really are seeing the dawn of interventional surgery .
so combine those with the adventurous outliers from new generations of locally trained architects and designers and engineers , and always remember that you are designing for curving , tapering , hollow poles .
so — ( laughter ) i announced what we were going to do in a broadcast interview , and straightaway , the emails started coming .
a team of doctors in europe published a series of papers about colonoscopies .
say a new super bug has emerged .
i also started looking around in the city and trying to photograph them .
i believe that is what is happening .
and as we watch it , we are ashamed .
that &apos;s where those big peaks are over to the left .
but with this in mind , we organized this expedition , which was the closest civilians have been to the nuclear power plant .
one advantage of that is that you can allocate money coherently .
we have a responsibility to try .
i mean , i &apos;d thought about the harbour bridge or bondi beach , but minto ? but still , i &apos;m a producer , and the lure of a site-specific theater project was more than i could resist . ( laughter ) so , off i went into friday afternoon traffic , and i &apos;ll never forget what i saw when i got there .
raisuddin : &quot; &quot; mark , you should know that i am praying for god , the most compassionate and gracious .
see , i &apos;m a computer scientist by background and not someone in the creative arts .
they want to be dual-career , dual-carer couples .
hold your hand out flat . open it up .
it can be put up in any environment , from an asphalt parking lot to pastures or fields , because it doesn &apos;t require any special setup or specialty tools .
and i keep it going , and i just got , ( laughter ) also , this suggestion from milan : it &apos;s our traffic divider , which we call &quot; &quot; panettone , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s painted ; it &apos;s these beautiful concrete things that you use around milan to define all the lanes of traffic .
so you take a look out in the real world , and the fun thing is you can actually hack these yourself .
the adoptive parents were lined up .
( applause ) and look what it does with its foot to get over challenging terrain .
before that i feel like i wasn &apos;t like this .
he grew the bushy black beard that obscured his face .
it &apos;s not called costuming at cons , it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; cosplay . &quot; &quot; now ostensibly , cosplay means people who dress up as their favorite characters from film and television and especially anime , but it is so much more than that .
100 bucks . that &apos;s the price-improvement curve that — we need some breakthroughs in physics along the way , i &apos;ll grant you that .
the asian free trade zone , almost free trade zone , that &apos;s emerging now has a greater trade volume than trade across the pacific .
so we &apos;re just beginning to explore what &apos;s possible when we use software to control the movement of objects in our environment .
and more importantly , when you &apos;re actually at the site of the memorial , you can see those connections .
average humidity worldwide has gone up four percent .
and i &apos;m glad i &apos;m a bee man and not a bat man , because there &apos;s no money to research the bat problems .
and actually , i spend as much of my time in clinic dealing with the emotional adjustment of patients as with the physical disability .
and all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce .
i went to mit , did my math , but i had this wonderful opportunity , because computers had just become visual .
to start simply , i want to say that compassion is kind .
or a 16-year-old girl who built an algorithm to help detect whether a cancer is benign or malignant in the off chance that she can save her daddy &apos;s life because he has cancer .
let me tell you a little bit about this chemistry of oil .
they were so focused on their own individual work , they didn &apos;t even know who they were sitting next to , and it was only when i insisted that we stop working and invest time in getting to know each other that we achieved real momentum .
at this point , you may be wondering what city officials think of all this .
so here &apos;s a typical situation , male meets female , lots of offspring .
and in 1996 , i found the answer in principles in a master spoken-word artist named reg e. gaines , who wrote the famous poem , &quot; &quot; please don &apos;t take my air jordans . &quot; &quot; and i followed this guy everywhere until i had him in the room , and i read him one of my pieces , and you know what he told me ?
ok . and what we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re going to immerse ourselves in my world .
facts were actually banished from our home .
most of those missing puzzle pieces are southern continents , because it was those continents that are least explored .
and that &apos;s architecture .
interviewer : so you &apos;ve got to put your feet out sideways .
and i &apos;m going to take that idea and apply it to other sort of iconic things from my life .
thank you .
i was almost a foot taller than my father .
it shows that it &apos;s essentially impossible until now to develop a science of economics because we are sentient beings who anticipate and there is a problem of self-fulfilling prophesies .
you can go to places like this .
ask any 10-year-old girl if she wants to go to mars .
audience : yellow.db : good .
but i didn &apos;t let that daunt me .
the denominator of the gymnosophist &apos;s life was infinity .
let me tell you a little bit about a couple of new deceptions we &apos;ve been tracking and documenting .
second story .
dk : lots of loudspeakers , quite frankly .
walt whitman also did this back in the day , before there was internet technology . sock puppet becomes interesting when we get to scale , which is the domain of the chinese water army .
i mean , they took — they had a technology disruption , and rather than taking a business model innovation to correspond to that , they took and sought a legal solution and the industry that brought you elvis and the beatles is now suing children and is in danger of collapse .
we tell stories all the time about everything , and i think we do it because the world is kind of a crazy , chaotic place , and sometimes stories , we &apos;re trying to make sense of the world a little bit , trying to bring some order to it .
we worked with , by the way , honeybee robotics . this is the brain .
lisa o &apos;connell , a dramaturge and director of a playwright center , pulled us aside after the show and said , &quot; do you have any idea how political that was ? &quot;
yes , it &apos;s uphill the entire way , because the south pole is at 10,000 feet , and you &apos;re starting at sea level .
i was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict , and all the day they were having a party , they celebrated , all of south central , all the churches . and they say , &apos; well , finally justice has been done in this society . &apos; well , what about victims &apos; rights ?
that i wanted to do as an extension of my composition , as an extension of a kind of creative impulse .
now we need you to take this story out to tell it to the people who will listen and educate them on what it means to beat ebola , and more importantly , we need you to advocate with the people who can help us bring the resources we need to these countries , to beat this disease .
and that as we worry about our next job in the office , the next design that we can get , to keep our workers .
well , one obvious barrier is cost .
and finally , they have a different model of scale , and it &apos;s a chinese restaurant model of how to scale .
and then i ask myself , &quot; &quot; why was it ever small ? &quot; &quot; isn &apos;t it weird ? you know , if collaboration is so cool , is cross-functional working is so amazing , why did we build these huge hierarchies ? what &apos;s going on ?
dude , can you , all right , can you just keep it down ?
so what happens , if you want to sustain desire , it &apos;s that real dialectic piece .
he used a pseudonym like bull walker , or later , the masked marvel .
it &apos;s not something specific to humans — it &apos;s a really ancient behavior which really helps us regulate how we feel and makes us feel better .
i got infected when i was 17 , when , as a student of the design college , i encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas , challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me .
now , there are three ways that i think infidelity hurts differently today .
they had a very strong preference for biting on the face .
but think about it .
but about , oh , 15 months after i got to cambridge , a rumor began to appear from linus pauling &apos;s son , who was in cambridge , that his father was now working on dna .
it &apos;s a heavy element produced in thermonuclear explosions of supernovae .
the poem reacts to old lipstick ads , and its edginess about statement , its reversals and halts , have everything to do with resisting the language of ads that want to tell us so easily what to want , what to do , what to think .
things like , how do we measure ourselves as humans ?
years later , she moved to america .
we all knew about the risks , and how terrifying the journey is , and i met many people who lost loved ones at sea .
so as i said , i think bread is a transformational food .
it means if i get to the end of my life , the universe can &apos;t turn to me and go , &quot; &quot; what have you been doing , you idiot ?
and when a number of filaments come together in a knot , that makes a supercluster of galaxies .
and i &apos;ll tell you why .
and then a few weeks later we can take out the cartilage scaffold .
( applause )
much as these flows do all that good , there are barriers to these flows of remittances , these 400 billion dollars of remittances .
this is a 10-kiloton bomb , slightly smaller than was used in hiroshima . and i want to just conclude this by just giving you some information . i think — &quot; &quot; news you could use &quot; &quot; kind of concept here .
so what if we analyze these two groups separately — the famous and the non-famous ?
the year was 2011 and all over southern africa and the whole continent , affordable data packages for smartphones and internet surfing became much easier to get .
and i leave feeling actually unhappy .
they sell 1.5 billion servings every single day .
it would not be the first time a poet had written the poem that he wanted to hear .
and so they got to work and they went to cities across the country and got regulations put in place to slow down the growth of the jitney .
using the old thinking , of national infrastructure and pipe work , is too expensive .
every day we &apos;re connecting more and more of our lives to the internet , which means that the internet of things will soon be the internet of things to be hacked .
because each unit knows where it is in space and is self-controlled , there is really no limit to their number .
we &apos;re going to do some jokes , some gags , some little skits — and then we &apos;re going to talk about the l1 point .
i was no more than just a commodity .
and how do i create my own life ?
in the front , there are 10 ranches strung right along the base of the mountains using the water from the mountains .
and if this is the end of my five minutes , i want to tell you that i actually did survive , which was a surprise .
in the end , 300 people were gravely wounded and over 172 men , women and children lost their lives that day .
and in short order , thousands of people were building our machine .
we had this little bond .
and the question is : how did we come from there to here ?
we then managed to set up a war crimes tribunal to deal specifically with those kinds of issues .
the fact that he lives a five-minute drive from my parents &apos; home made it easier to follow him through the years .
so today we &apos;re going to show you one example of how you can use this .
we are ordinary people attempting to do extraordinary things , and so we need to be supported in that way .
i &apos;m here to show you how something you can &apos;t see can be so much fun to look at .
nature has been doing that for a long time .
and generally , the people would say , oh , well that &apos;s bad news .
and people were like , &quot; &quot; we knew they were vicious . we knew they were . &quot; &quot; and so people love to form their opinions .
i labored in that vineyard for a quarter century before making my way to a little kingdom of the just in upstate south carolina , a methodist-affiliated institution of higher learning called wofford college .
but we are going to have to decide between zero and sum .
what i need is a system where i put out my hand and — poof ! — the product shows up and i pack it into the order , and now we &apos;re thinking , this would be a very operator-centric approach to solving the problem .
so if we want to make cells happy outside our bodies , we need to become cell architects .
and so everyone can be at least happy to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas .
in about two to three hours , she started to move .
and the work we have been doing was completely difficult to do and to achieve it .
i &apos;m playing around with how we view something , and i &apos;m doing it very deliberately .
and beavers , like wolves , are ecosystem engineers .
now imagine doing this test for other planets .
but i wouldn &apos;t have you think that i don &apos;t like the place on the right , which i quite do . i &apos;ve come to love the city and its kind of diversity , and its resilience , and its dependence on density and how we &apos;re connected together .
and they spread , actually , very quickly , even outside the u.s.
this is a world in which there &apos;s no electricity , there &apos;s no money , there &apos;s no medical competence .
♫ you ’ re my clonie . ♫ &quot; &quot; oh clonie , how i love you . &quot; &quot; &quot; ha , i &apos;m the only person i ever loved . &quot;
he didn &apos;t mention the speed . your eye is constantly in motion , moving around , looking at eyes , noses , elbows , looking at interesting things in the world .
and i find this incredible .
the bottom players , you see all the activity in dorsomedial pfc .
but that doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re a bad basketball player .
and the second ingredient , which would solve mobility , that very difficult challenge in developing countries , in a very low-cost and simple way , would be to have hundreds of kilometers of streets only for buses , buses and bicycles and pedestrians .
but they all have one thing in common : they all need to look like something .
the system is reliable but the problem is you never know how well a strain is going to grow .
that is a wonderful thing .
and together , we can help create a sustainable world , and , if we get it right , we can make sustainability affordable for the many people , not a luxury for the few .
and to talk about that , i &apos;m going to go back to the beginning , because in the beginning were commodities .
( applause ) i mean , the new york times recently called for an amnesty for you .
thank you .
did people see the movie &quot; &quot; ai &quot; &quot; ? ( audience : yes . ) rb : yeah , it was really bad , but — remember , especially when haley joel osment , the little robot , looked at the blue fairy for 2,000 years without taking his eyes off it ?
they weren &apos;t there before , and then zzzzzt !
this is a really basic , basic prosthetic limb under here .
it &apos;s about 3.3 billion pounds per year out of 620 billion .
well , i &apos;ll tell you — a lot .
so the ancient greeks knew that dogs sent invisible signals between each other .
it ’ s true that some humans eat better than others .
the shared spaces are also treated in the same manner , where walls are decorated in faux marble patterns .
we have g.m. crops , we have pharmaceuticals , we have new vaccines , all using roughly the same technology , but with very different outcomes .
they &apos;re laughing because he said , draw from the middle-right to the middle , and he kind of messed up .
now , you can see united states , in 1983 , had a very low percentage infected , but due to the big population , still a sizable bubble .
wait till you see , maybe next year , what kind of windows we &apos;ve invented .
and so i thought , how could we address the energy crisis in this country ?
while making the book , we took great care that none of the illustrations were objectionable in any way and that it is culturally sensitive .
( applause ) it is possible to create emotionally and physically safe classrooms where students also thrive academically .
so , how cheap is it ?
now you and i could look at this and we could argue about whether it &apos;s incremental , and i could say something like &quot; &quot; 80-20 rule , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s really hard to move up to that new curve .
look at the fat layer .
that i tried to do .
the global commission on drug policy really knew its opposition , and rather than fighting them , our chair — former brazilian president fernando henrique cardoso — reached out to leaders from across the political spectrum , from liberals to conservatives .
it may have built a road , and that road may have served a very good role .
and the question i get when i start talking about this most often is , &quot; what made you interested in this subject ? &quot;
we &apos;re tagging on the california coast , and we &apos;re tagging over in taiwan and japan .
thanks to ligo , we know how to build exquisite detectors that can listen to the universe , to the rustle and the chirp of the cosmos .
and everything that everybody is talking about today isn &apos;t possible if we keep having an educational system that does not value these qualities , because we won &apos;t get there with a standardized test , and we won &apos;t get there with a culture of one right answer .
and it was this interaction between that kind of , up-the-ante stuff that became pretty interesting .
and here i &apos;ll zoom in a little bit . we &apos;re looking right there in the center .
and they came down on the side of open publication , which is the right approach — we &apos;ve briefed the white house , we &apos;ve briefed members of congress , we &apos;ve tried to take and push the policy issues in parallel with the scientific advances .
i eventually made it to hawaii still alive .
if i owned the internet , napster , monster and friendster.com would be one big website .
i spend a lot of my time thinking about how to spend my time .
same strategy .
child : when i watch tv , it &apos;s just some shows that you just — that are pretend , and when you explore , you get more imagination than you already had , and when you get more imagination , it makes you want to go deeper in so you can get more and see beautifuller things , like the path , if it &apos;s a path , it could lead you to a beach , or something , and it could be beautiful .
there are kunskapsskolan schools in sweden .
i went back to the states , anticipating i &apos;d return to europe , but the heart catheterization showed that i wasn &apos;t going anywhere further that a flight-for-life from johns hopkins hospital .
they &apos;ve never made money .
audience : ♫ aaaaaaah ... ♫ itay talgam : come on , with me . if you do it without me i feel even more redundant than i already feel .
green chemistry is chemistry in water .
we probably wouldn &apos;t still be here today if we weren &apos;t so resistant to change .
they also happen to be particularly adept at working the international tax system so as to lower their tax bill very , very significantly .
and it was looking good for a while , but i left it outside , because you had to leave it outside to dry , and unfortunately i came back and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato .
is this the kind of society we want to build , without even knowing we &apos;ve done this , because we turned decision-making to machines we don &apos;t totally understand ?
instead of seeing its primary objective as consumption , design thinking is beginning to explore the potential of participation — the shift from a passive relationship between consumer and producer to the active engagement of everyone in experiences that are meaningful , productive and profitable .
and there &apos;s only data where there is light .
and of course you might think that doing a film on happiness might not really be worthwhile .
imagine in the physical world if somebody followed our children around with a camera and a notebook and recorded their every movement .
life itself has existed for billions of years and has continually adapted to use materials effectively .
she said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m 61 . &quot; &quot; he grinned , said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m 59 . &quot; &quot; today i ’ ve had a really nice time , so tomorrow if you wanted you could come over to mine ?
but i see something profoundly transformative in experiencing death as a social process and not just a biological one .
we added weights to their ankles that amounted to 15 percent of their body weight .
this is what we will do today .
religion is more than belief .
and we know the solar output &apos;s not constant through time .
a crystalline stackable principle in the center on the top , which i am trying to turn into a concert hall in iceland .
just like matter can exist as liquid or solid , so the higgs field , the substance that fills all space-time , could exist in two states .
so lesbor , we blend the two .
the town had a vermiculite mine in it .
and then spock turns round , he goes , &quot; &quot; james , i know all of the brahms waltzes , and i don &apos;t believe this is one of them in the category . &quot; &quot; that &apos;s where i &apos;m at .
the more techniques you know , the more things you can make , and the more patterns you can recognize in things you might already like or love .
what about art ?
and i thought a lot about , what was my daughter &apos;s life going to be like without me ?
so you &apos;ll see images of this remarkable building .
and so , it &apos;s a very dynamic , and i think , historic and exciting community to be involved with .
it &apos;s not taught in universities .
and i am on this stage because i am a model .
nothing really interesting , basically .
it &apos;s true too in argentina on the patagonian shelf , which is now in serious trouble .
satellites like these have done an amazing job at helping us to understand our planet .
he said , &quot; &quot; he who receives an idea from me receives instruction himself , without lessening mine .
today , we know that this future vision didn &apos;t come true .
to build that , what we &apos;d do with whirlwind technology is we &apos;d have to take up roughly from the 10 to mulholland , and from the 405 to la cienega just with those whirlwinds .
they got you out of purgatory faster .
( laughter ) a particularly dramatic example of this comes from a neurological disorder known as capgras syndrome .
yeah , thought so . so we ’ ve all seen it , haven ’ t we ?
and that day i knew that when i grew up , i was going to become a brain doctor , scientist , something or the other .
we &apos;re looking at attacking energy , environment , nanotechnology — and i &apos;ll talk about those more in a moment .
but again , they have the same static physical form for each of these applications .
and westerners — europeans or americans — who didn &apos;t know about this before , &#91; saw &#93; this practice within some of the muslim communities who migrated from north africa .
my girlfriend at the time , who &apos;s no longer my girlfriend — ( laughter ) — hated it .
language evolved to solve the crisis of visual theft .
signs of their outrage ...
take , for example , this beautiful blue nacre shell .
3d printers instantaneously produce any customized design .
at first it was pretty sensible . we flew british airways to moscow .
so one of the things we discovered is where are the hot spots of diversity ?
that &apos;s the only space she could express her creativity .
uberx , when we first started , was literally 10 or 15 percent cheaper than our black car product .
hi . my name is cameron russell , and for the last little while , i &apos;ve been a model .
but it is going to happen in this century .
and at the trial , her trial , a very distinguished pediatrician gave evidence that the chance of two cot deaths , innocent deaths , in a family like hers — which was professional and non-smoking — was one in 73 million .
and this is the reason : in two countries that hadn &apos;t had this disease for more than probably a decade , on opposite sides of the globe , there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks .
( music ) ( video ) child : today , i had some octyphenols , some artificial musks and some bisphenol a.
meetup , a service founded so that users could find people in their local area who share their interests and affinities and actually have a real-world meeting offline in a cafe or a pub or what have you .
and i spent quite a lot of time with them rather than in punts .
but that is not my confession .
we are interacting with our entertainment .
we &apos;ve since scaled up the designs : &quot; &quot; ocean atlas , &quot; &quot; in the bahamas , rising 16 feet up to the surface and weighing over 40 tons , to now currently in lanzarote , where i &apos;m making an underwater botanical garden , the first of its kind in the atlantic ocean .
i want to be the center of attention .
we can actually do the same thing with much less energy .
the title is &quot; &quot; this happened . &quot; &quot; a student , a young woman in a fourth-floor hallway of her lycee , perched on the ledge of an open window chatting with friends between classes ; a teacher passes and chides her , &quot; be careful , you might fall , &quot; almost banteringly chides her , &quot; you might fall , &quot; and the young woman , 18 , a girl really , though she wouldn &apos;t think that , as brilliant as she is , first in her class , and &quot; &quot; beautiful , too , &quot; &quot; she &apos;s often told , smiles back , and leans into the open window , which wouldn &apos;t even be open if it were winter — if it were winter someone would have closed it ( &quot; &quot; close it ! &quot; &quot; ) —
problems from weeds , weed control , cost montana nearly 200 million dollars a year . montana has lost agricultural areas from salinization , problems of forest management , problems of forest fires . second item on my checklist : climate change . yes — the climate in montana is getting warmer and drier , but montana agriculture depends especially on irrigation from the snow pack , and as the snow is melting — for example , as the glaciers in glacier national park are disappearing — that &apos;s bad news for montana irrigation agriculture .
this bottle of oil , distilled over a hundred million years of geological time , ancient sunlight , contains the energy equivalent of about five weeks hard human manual labor — equivalent to about 35 strong people coming round and working for you .
this was me at age 13 , when i started my first diet .
at first , the spoofer was just a jumble of cables and computers , though we eventually got it packaged into a small box .
it &apos;s a geometric language .
when the santa barbara spill happened in 1969 , it formed the environmental movement in its modern form .
( applause ) we &apos;ll see where this goes . we were so excited about this that we realized that that small-size scale — and where everything gets sticky , and gravity doesn &apos;t matter anymore — we needed to look at ants and their feet , because one of my other colleagues at berkeley has built a six-millimeter silicone robot with legs . but it gets stuck . it doesn &apos;t move very well .
so , we got milk , for the american audience .
now , in the 27 years since hiv was identified as the cause of aids , we &apos;ve developed more drugs to treat hiv than all other viruses put together .
what happens is , you take pictures as the earth rotates , you get a fan across the sky .
( music : &quot; &quot; sonata in f , &quot; &quot; kv 13 , by wolfgang a. mozart ) it fits the room perfectly .
for example , the waves that hit us on september 14 — and yes , every single one of you stretched and compressed under the action of that wave — when the waves hit , they stretched the average person by one part in 10 to the 21 .
it has two big differences with traditional version control systems .
so in a way , it is everybody &apos;s business .
i was called down to the ward to see him by a respiratory physician .
he &apos;s 45 years old . he &apos;s currently enrolled in college .
isn &apos;t that incredible that we can &apos;t read each other &apos;s minds ?
we can , for example , go find miko &apos;s locker and get some more information about her .
i think usually , as companies get bigger , they find it really hard to have small , innovative projects .
we then start adding the muscle on top .
and all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers , just like designers are seeking scientists .
they love the neutrons that are going on and helping this reaction take place .
differences , freedom , choices , possibilities .
now this kingdom had many resources and mighty ambitions , but the one thing it lacked was people .

most people say , no , i &apos;m going to schlep across town to save 100 bucks on the purchase of a car ?
it was originally designed as a golfing controller to detect the motion of your swing .
because when we think about blogs , i think for most of us who are concerned about them , we &apos;re primarily concerned with things like politics , technology , etc .
and you know what ?
he was rattling off — i mean , that &apos;s amazing , i &apos;m sorry .
and we need to be very attentive and vigilant to thinking about where things that we do may unintentionally prevent them from being able to achieve their important activities .
along the way we scaled up to the 20 watt-hour cell .
in the late &apos; 90s , there was a big push for ethics in the world of investment and banking .
if you look out your window and you can see long &apos;s peak , you &apos;re probably familiar with it .
we were using armored vehicles , decoy cars , changing patterns of travel , changing homes , all sorts of security measures .
you &apos;ve really got to just throw your assumptions out the door .
so , how can we envision the city of the future ?
he was learning about our process about design thinking , about empathy , about iterative prototyping .
these are four 8.2 meter telescopes .
some of these images are degraded images of black people , kind of histories of very challenging content , and where better than a neighborhood with young people who are constantly asking themselves about their identity to talk about some of the complexities of race and class ?
that &apos;s my premise .
i held two assumptions : one , that poor people are poor in part because they &apos;re uneducated and don &apos;t make good choices ; two is that we then need people like me to figure out what they need and get it to them .
in fact , suffering is so huge and enormous , his own becomes less and less monumental .
this is one of x &apos;s mantras .
alright , lets turn to iran .
what do i mean by that ?
this now is the third different output .
it &apos;s a pretty profound statement .
but alluding to the country &apos;s continual attempts to build a postracial society after being ravaged for decades by apartheid , i tweeted , # ifafricawasabar south africa would be drinking all kinds of alcohol and begging them to get along in its stomach .
but , in any event , if you can burn it with the same efficiency — because it &apos;s external combustion — as your kitchen stove , if you can burn any fuel , it turns out to be pretty neat .
we can look at all their velocities and we can build a model that predicts what is the likelihood that this shot would go in under these circumstances ?
we decided to provide vasectomy to all men , but in particular , american men to the front of the queue , right up to the ambassador &apos;s residence during his &#91; unclear &#93; .
okay , so what ? in fact , the so what is , in the brain , changes in neural activity , the things that make your brain work , the things that make your software work in your brain , are tightly correlated with changes in blood flow .
imagine the ripples of this notion for the millions of people living and dying with dementia .
in order to do that in 20 minutes , i have to bring out four ideas — it &apos;s like four pieces of a puzzle .
ecx , moreover , can become a trading platform for a pan-african market in agricultural commodities .
and the fax said , there should be songs , there should be an &quot; &quot; i want &quot; &quot; song , there should be a happy village song , there should be a love story and there should be a villain .
so they make kind of heroic assumptions about that .
and i revisit this world thinking about the image or cliché about what we want to do , and what are the words , colloquialisms , that we have with the expressions .
now it may not seem like it , but we are .
you are speaking your truth .
you can actually see , right here , it will vibrate .
but part of this internet is being held captive by the less noble aspects of our human behavior .
the simplest element on one of these structures is 100 times that size .
promoting recycling , things like garden-share , that matches up people who don &apos;t have a garden who would like to grow food , with people who have gardens they aren &apos;t using anymore .
as i told you , geologists love craters .
we call it the electronic jellyfish .
in canada , it &apos;s 3.6 percent per year .
what &apos;s unusual about this one , maybe , is that it &apos;s from 1953 .
or , even better , let &apos;s just take people right out of the emergency room — undefined , community-acquired respiratory tract infections .
do you want to come over and listen ? &quot; &quot; and i &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; yes , ma &apos;am , i do . &quot; &quot; and she &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; well what are you going to do when you get here ? &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot; &quot; and i &apos;d go over there and i would , i would just listen .
now , when your state is collapsing , your economy is heading south at a rate of knots , the last people you want coming on to the labor market are 14,000 men and women whose chief skills are surveillance , are smuggling , building underground networks and killing people .
by the way , speaking of the filing system , it never occurred to us that these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network .
and they &apos;re learning to become like us .
i mean , that &apos;s 2005 figures .
so in order to ask evolutionary questions , we need to know about reproductive success .
it &apos;s difficult because it &apos;s a very experiential medium .
( applause ) chris anderson : really powerfully argued .
the single story creates stereotypes , and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue , but that they are incomplete .
trade and industry takes 43 billion .
in philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program , so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday , taking them home , getting access to information .
based on the other images we have , i &apos;m really happy how it looks today .
and at this rate at which we are losing fish , it is a human problem of enormous dimensions , a health problem of a kind we haven &apos;t seen before .
when i wrote my report to the koreans , i said , &quot; &quot; look , i don &apos;t know what this guy was doing , &quot; &quot; but my guess was interacting with his mother or his girlfriend .
because , you know , it &apos;s great for us , but bad for humans .
( video ) claudia : oooooh !
and i remember watching my family go through that and thinking that i never wanted another family to feel that kind of loss .
hence my motto : green is the new red , white and blue . &quot; &quot; and i asked myself , in a way , looking back , &quot; when did that kind of awareness of the planet and its fragility first appear ? &quot;
last year , i was in nairobi , in the slums , in one called korogocho — which literally means when translated , &quot; &quot; standing shoulder to shoulder . &quot; &quot; and i spoke with this women &apos;s group that &apos;s pictured here .
lastly i want to say that all of you , probably , have had some relationship at some time in your life with a dog , a cat , some sort of pet , and you recognized that those are individuals .
i &apos;m going to give you four specific examples , i &apos;m going to cover at the end about how a company called silk tripled their sales ; how an artist named jeff koons went from being a nobody to making a whole bunch of money and having a lot of impact ; to how frank gehry redefined what it meant to be an architect .
it &apos;s usually some kind of choice between the vocational and the intellectual .
you &apos;d probably kick me out , or something .
so we actually started with a number of volunteers who helped us in seattle , just over a year ago , to tag what they were throwing away — different types of things , as you can see here — things they would throw away anyway .
but how could we show these teeny-weeny things ?
and this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play .
and in that moment , i started this journey .
ca : thank you for scaring the living daylights out of us . thank you , ralph .
in many theme parks , you can pay extra to jump to the head of the line .
unfortunately , over the past quarter century , epidemic obesity has made our two-ton steel cars gain weight twice as fast as we have .
and now it &apos;s a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for .
so a lot of your vision — the bulk of it is visual , and it &apos;s pouring in .
your job is only to be human .
and we recruited wonderful staff , highly motivated staff .
before you breed .
we opened the gates for higher education for every qualified student .
or this could represent a college green .
it &apos;s &apos; technology , entertainment and design . &apos; &quot; &quot; and she said , &quot; &quot; well , you design a story when you make it up , it &apos;s entertainment when you tell it , and you &apos;re going to use a microphone . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) i said , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re a peach , ma . pop there ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s the matter ? the pearls of wisdom leaping from my lips like lemmings is no good for you ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) then my pop got on there .
it &apos;s a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits , because it &apos;s always still plastic .
because of the speed and brevity of social media , we are forced to jump to conclusions and write sharp opinions in 140 characters about complex world affairs .
and here &apos;s the thing that you need to get comfortable with when you &apos;ve given the tool to acquire information to students , is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process .
in the past , different students were taught in similar ways .
so now i want to take you to the moment of — when you &apos;re an entrepreneur , and you &apos;ve started a new company , there &apos;s the , here &apos;s all the stuff we do beforehand , and then the service launches . what happens ?
it would be a crime for all of us not to be aware when somebody shows up at a swimming pool and says one word , just one word , if you don &apos;t listen if that word is &quot; &quot; lifecode . &quot; &quot; thank you very much .
and then he went to the top-most peak of the greatest mountain of the center of the world called meru .
here &apos;s an example .
but if we &apos;re already invoking aliens in this explanation , then who is to say they didn &apos;t efficiently clean up all this mess for recycling purposes ?
but i do think we &apos;re going to figure it out eventually .
so , a moment .
if there was a dial tone and you dialed a number , the odds were two in three you wouldn &apos;t get the number you were intending to reach .
he is not a political man , but in this guise he has given us the institution for democracy , from where we can rise .
that &apos;s 40 billion dollars a year wasted on electricity that does not contribute to our well-being but does contribute to climate change .
we &apos;ll see what i come up with . thanks for having me .
so there really was no tolerable margin of error .
this is the opposite of what we were built on : independence , self-sufficiency , autonomy .
and as the student video showed , we can impact and move .
you know , you guys are so great , you don &apos;t even know what a connectome is , and you &apos;re willing to play along with me .
metaphorical thinking is essential to how we understand ourselves and others , how we communicate , learn , discover and invent .
and this sort of data explosion available from these is really almost becoming a challenge .
and i think we are not really being honest about that , for so many reasons . it &apos;s so hard to talk about gender .
a brewery is essentially a bioreactor .
and on the bottom-left is a thermal camera .
they have similar sound of eyes .
trying to find a space suit to do this has led me to an area of technology that i never really expected when i set about doing this .
we end up in the situation — we have that scripted life that everybody seems to be living going up this ladder to nowhere .
it &apos;s about your own interpretation and doing something different . &quot; &quot; and i like that .
and with the known physics etc , it &apos;s something actually which has been pointed out by frank drake , many years ago , and shklovsky .
and the second world war was really a terrible event , also economically for japan .
it &apos;s great to let go .
and usually they are accompanied by videos .
the athletes &apos; bodies have gotten much more different from one another .
bringing people , future generations , together through arabic calligraphy is what i do .
it doesn &apos;t mean that at all . it doesn &apos;t ensure it .
dh : could you spread your legs a little bit ?
we know that when it comes to choosing somebody for a job , for an award , we are strongly biased by their race , we are biased by their gender , we are biased by how attractive they are , and sometimes we might say , &quot; &quot; well fine , that &apos;s the way it should be . &quot; &quot; but other times we say , &quot; &quot; this is wrong . &quot; &quot; and so to combat this , we don &apos;t just try harder , but rather what we do is we set up situations where these other sources of information can &apos;t bias us , which is why many orchestras audition musicians behind screens , so the only information they have
what you have here seems to be nothing , but contains an incredible amount of scientific information that helps us explore what makes us human .
mohammed lost both legs during the last week of the conflict .
the fall of the berlin wall would maybe not &#91; have been &#93; there .
he served 24 years for a crime he didn &apos;t commit .
they would offer sweets or money .
so , almost anywhere i went , there they were .
we &apos;re ok , though ? kt : yes .
but the idea has a merit . the idea has a merit .
the amount of energy in each cubic centimeter remains the same , even as the universe gets bigger and bigger .
we &apos;re not doing a great job managing money .
and a little bit later , they were joking around in the kitchen in spanish , that had nothing to do with me , and that is duality .
and so i went back to the united nations .
and it worked .
when those extra three billion people &apos;s identity is mobile , it isn &apos;t fixed ?
the chimps are actually interacting with each other through the computers .
e : what &apos;s the matter ?
but it matters a lot how fast we win it .
so i took another crack at it — you &apos;ve got to keep it moving — and i xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper and i pasted them down on an ugly board .
ernest madu : the lesson in this is that it can be done , and it can be sustained , and you can make it possible for everyone .
moderator : wow . okay , that &apos;s where we are going .
and then when they get old , they haven &apos;t really developed a philosophy of life , but they &apos;ve decided , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve been successful at everything ; i &apos;m just not going to die . &quot; &quot; and so they hire personal trainers ; they &apos;re popping cialis like breath mints .
well let &apos;s take a look at something like autism incidence per thousand .
this may sound a bit kooky to you .
and it also enhances nuclear weapons proliferation .
and this outer layer , this is the vasculature , which is incredible , around a human brain .
but over the centuries , we have constructed on top of this objective reality a second layer of fictional reality , a reality made of fictional entities , like nations , like gods , like money , like corporations .
what are you in america doing about it ?
but i find that with my job , that the rewards far outweigh the risks , and as many risks as i take , my clients take far greater risks , because they have a lot more to lose if their cases go unheard , or worse , if they &apos;re penalized for having me as their lawyer .
so this is not by accident that the voters are not interested to vote anymore .
this is emblematic of it — this is wing dining , recalling those balmy summer days somewhere over france in the 20s , dining on the wing of a plane . you can &apos;t see it very well here , but that &apos;s hemingway reading some pages from his new novel to fitzgerald and ford madox ford until the slipstream blows him away .
was that essential to sort of maintain the quality of what was being built ?
this is the sensory part of the program , people .
it &apos;s a sense of privilege that the natural universe doesn &apos;t share .
this is actually something that one of our engineers , dom , built in a weekend .
it &apos;s no small thing to change a prison system .
i &apos;m not an anthropologist , i have no technical study with the subject , but i do have a very , very , very deep passion , and i believe that i had to choose the most beautiful people on the planet in the most beautiful environment that they lived in , and put the two together and present them to you .
audience : yes .
my sweet angels , come back . &quot; &quot; medea she was , next time i saw her .
you &apos;d all make great blind people . ( laughter ) let &apos;s have a look at what can happen when this activation process is given some time and attention .
and this is called &quot; &quot; the wilderness downtown . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s an online music video for the arcade fire .
and when i got out of my car , the air was pulsing .
well , dickens was right and he was wrong . &#91; correction : rudyard kipling &#93; &#91; kipling &#93; said , &quot; &quot; the colonel &apos;s lady and judy o &apos;grady are sisters underneath the skin . &quot; &quot; ( applause )
we now have a platform .
jason started at darpa on march 18th , 2010 .
so again , we can see that price plays an enormous role in people &apos;s willingness to reduce their driving behavior .
the act of making is a social activity .
&quot; &quot; horizon , &quot; &quot; which takes its cue from the academics , won &apos;t touch it with a barge pole .
the department used to have a process which is very interesting .
and what they &apos;ve realized is that using violence in the situations they operate in is not only less humane , but it &apos;s less effective than using methods that connect people with people , that rebuild .
it wasn &apos;t simple to work in such environments , sometimes having pigs under you while you paint or climbing a stack of garbage to reach a lift .
it was practically everybody .
so the concept here : so if you do have a deceased or injured organ , we take a very small piece of that tissue , less than half the size of a postage stamp .
because most of you compared the price of this big mac to the price you &apos;re used to paying . rather than asking , &quot; &quot; what else can i do with my money , &quot; &quot; comparing this investment to other possible investments , you compared to the past .
be bold . stand up . be fearless . be confident .
and the conclusion was it was tasks that included social-evaluative threat — threats to self-esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance .
in the midst of such widespread uncertainty , we may , in fact , be insecure .
so , eventually , the manufacturers actually arrived at a compromise , which was the combo pack .
around the world , many people began to ask , can we ever stop ebola when it starts to spread like this ?
in recent years , because of global warming , they now cover about 10 percent — an increase by a factor of 25 to 50 .
these are just a few of the ideas that are to die for .
some of them show greater variability .
and they need to think about the substance of their agreement much more than about the labels they want to attach to them .
so the question is , so , why are they all standing there holding books ?
but the religious world doesn &apos;t think that way .
financially , seen over the long term , it was actually successful .
but what if that &apos;s not how we need to buy sneakers either ?
nuclear — there are two bars here .
one of the ranches is called the kirkeby ranch , and i &apos;ll take you there for a minute .
so clearly there was a problem with deforestation .
and that &apos;s the way , ultimately after some ups and downs , i ended up designing the chair i &apos;m going to show you .
well , they signed me up immediately .
my ideal world is a place where no one is left behind , where everyone is needed exactly where they are , like the fibers and the tendons in a bow , a place where the strong is flexible and the vulnerable is resilient .
that implies a lot of trust .
you see , the folks at the ministry of health , the hospital administrators , the doctors , the nurses — they are among just five percent of their peers who get an education after secondary school .
your phone is not very natural .
even if you don &apos;t want to , it &apos;s very difficult numerically .
i mean , that &apos;s a fine logic , that sounds pretty convincing , pretty ironclad , doesn &apos;t it ?
this is the power of nudges when trying to solve complex social problems , and when you do that , you shouldn &apos;t try to tell people how to adapt .
we found that we could discover the causation of the positive states , the relationship between left hemispheric activity and right hemispheric activity , as a cause of happiness .
i wanted to make more of these forests .
this is how to stop a runaway stage .
a well-crafted cyber attack could break into his phone , disable the overvoltage protections on his battery , drastically overload the circuit , cause the battery to overheat , and explode .
so are the pessimists right ?
a lot of my clients are very young .
that &apos;s a problem because they dropped two or three decent items .
this is a tapir .
and unlike the juicy salif , it does not threaten to attach itself to your brain , rather , it simply attaches itself to your brain .
and here &apos;s another example of that interesting cross-pollination between science and art .
we &apos;re only trying to improve our lives .
the earth can support that if we choose the right path .
but i think we &apos;re ignoring certain facts that tell us something about what we can do .
and later on in the night , i woke up because i &apos;m always waking up in the night , and i went by the computer and i see all these red dots , you know , on facebook , which i &apos;ve never seen before .
( laughter ) and what i realized is i needed an expert .
one was ray anderson , who turned — ( applause ) — turned , you know , a part of the evil empire into a zero-footprint , or almost zero-footprint business .
in afghanistan , people go to extraordinary lengths to be able to watch this program .
then we rebuild . then we respect . &quot; &quot; and i burst out in tears , because my father had only just died prior to this journey , and i didn &apos;t ever acknowledge him , i didn &apos;t ever appreciate him for the fact that i &apos;m probably standing here today because of him .
now people have a natural intuition about these trade-offs .
we can &apos;t just focus on identifying the best ; we &apos;ve got to move the rest .
and you know , there &apos;s another adage in hollywood , that nobody knows nothing about anything .
it became a policy of &quot; &quot; positive discrimination , &quot; &quot; we call it now .
but neither of my parents knew this was happening .
so these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .
it &apos;s at the tip of the guadalquivir river .
so , while this space represents someone &apos;s profession , this one certainly represents a passion .
and we commissioned them to make a maquette , or a bust , of benjamin .
candles can &apos;t burn in a vacuum , therefore , probably sparklers wouldn &apos;t either .
now this gets us quickly to the third and final bit for today ; namely , we need to lift our sights , to set our sights on well-being , so that life and health and healthcare can become about making life more wonderful , rather than just less horrible .
we wash the bug out .
hk : i take it as a good sign , because people feel secure in this democracy .
well , at that time — i should go back .
and that ability to get others to want what you want , to get the outcomes you want without coercion or payment , is what i call soft power .
other conditions show people the future self .
( laughter ) man : your father , is he alive ?
additional experiments are going on in other animals that are useful for creating models for human disease , such as monkeys .
this is morina . this is a plant — which i &apos;ve always thought to be rather tedious — named after morin , who was an enterprising french gardener , who issued the first seed catalog in 1621 .
understanding , to me , does not remove the wonder and the joy .
they were tough in the sense that , as i grew up , both my mother and father would always say to me , it &apos;s really important that you always remember two things .
if you hold it too tightly , you crush it .
but it &apos;s the living room .
that &apos;s , in the additive , about 25 percent of our problem .
at home it sounds kind of anticlimactic .
with much greater humility , he knocks again on the door .
here is here , and out there is out there . okay ?
and there are a number of schemes , which i don &apos;t want to dwell on , but this is the one that we finally used where we projected onto rear screen material that was molded in the face — literally in the face of the person .
let us therefore go to battle stations , not to fight each other , but to begin deflecting these incoming asteroids .
the last 20 years has been the age of intervention , and afghanistan is simply one act in a five-act tragedy .
it &apos;s to have a look at different worlds .
it &apos;s really good . it starts with &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; and goes to &quot; &quot; aw . &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; is high , the &quot; &quot; aw &quot; &quot; is low .
because of data .
here &apos;s another example .
i &apos;ve been lucky enough to answer some of these questions as i &apos;ve explored this nocturnal world .
so figuring out all these relationships with relative and absolute location , distance , timing , velocities — that &apos;s really the key to the science of moving dots , or as we like to call it , spatiotemporal pattern recognition , in academic vernacular .
it should not be . until one of my colleagues said , &quot; &quot; it looks to me like a thermal blister , and the mid-ocean ridge must be a cooling curve . &quot; &quot; we said , &quot; &quot; let &apos;s go find out . &quot; &quot; we punched a bunch of heat probes . everything made sense , except , at the axis , there was missing heat . it was missing heat .
well , more idea creators .
( laughter ) ( applause ) brought in more women .
but this , i show you , when kids from the poorest congressional district in america can build a 30-foot by 15-foot wall , design it , plant it and install it in the heart of new york city , that &apos;s a true &quot; &quot; sí se puede &quot; &quot; moment .
it &apos;s real slavery in exactly the same way that slavery would be recognized throughout all of human history .
you know , reputations are built on trust , consistency , transparency .
so now it &apos;s able to train with just this little piece on the back .
now you &apos;ve probably seen pictures of neurons before .
in the 1980s , i developed an underwater keyboard .
the entire project is predicated on this act of love which is listening itself .
we took the english story and translated it to russian .
we &apos;ve got the fox watching the henhouse here .
if there &apos;s an achilles &apos; heel in one our projects , we want to know it now , up front , not way down the road .
half the children in this classroom have no parents because they &apos;ve died through aids .
whether it &apos;s in sierra leone or in boston , i hope this not only restores but indeed transforms their sense of human potential .
but some of them spend a lot of time in the sand , making mountains and seas — well , not seas , but different things — people and dogs , etc .
like those chloroplast cells — they &apos;re completely surrounded by other life .
where does it stop ?
( applause )
i &apos;ve been eating cereal for breakfast all of my life .
so low income here , high income there .
it &apos;s the autobiographical self which some species have , i think .
so to me , this was just so bizarre about how they could get the packaging so mysteriously beautiful and perfect and the message so unbearably , clearly wrong .
so it was true .
and stop where you want .
through back and forth conversations , they increase the resilience of the whole community .
how many people here have heard of pms ?
it &apos;s only a problem now when the chocolate is next to us .
i worked on a film called &quot; &quot; apollo 13 , &quot; &quot; and when i worked on this film , i discovered something about how our brains work , and how our brains work is that , when we &apos;re sort of infused with either enthusiasm or awe or fondness or whatever , it changes and alters our perception of things .
that was the question we wanted to know , so my colleagues and i decided to take a deep dive into the data .
anyway , i felt that it was important that you didn &apos;t have to make an adjustment in order to get this kind of action .
they blamed the leader of the opposition for not fighting it hard enough .
now it &apos;s a little bit less than 30 percent .
and so , she really just completely ignored me most of the time .
and i &apos;m working at all the energy i have to sort of communicate this message that we need preschool , we need head start , we need prenatal care .
( laughter ) ka : by being totally surprising and humorous , casey niestat got his funny idea and point seen five million times .
well , it &apos;s not going to come as any surprise for me to tell you that banks accept dirty money , but they prioritize their profits in other destructive ways too .
we developed leonardo in collaboration with stan winston studio .
but i did come to embrace this new identity , and in many ways i think of myself now as african .
and the technology we have developed — it &apos;s called sim ofdm .
on a business trip to florida in the early 1980s , bonica got a former student to drive him to the hyde park area in tampa .
it &apos;s really about designing from the inside out .
we wanted to be the only political party with no particular political leaning .
and i was in the states at the time , and they called me . he was very sick , the first time he got sick .
( applause )
they inhabit the trees at all body sizes , and , of course , they inhabit the land .
what are they going to think when we actually form a colony on mars ?
it &apos;s true .
the more output you churn out , the more variety you get and the better your chances of stumbling on something truly original .
all of this is a variation of the if-then model .
and i believe that magic and puzzles are the same because they both key into one of the most important human drives : the urge to solve .
( laughter ) it will look something like this . ( laughter )
i wanted people to ask me about my experiences .
you are going to hit the ground .
you know viennese audiences usually don &apos;t interfere with the music .
instead , get rid of the school bell .
there , it &apos;s nothing more than a gurgle of water that issues forth from beneath a rock in a boulder in a pasture , high in the bitterroot mountains .
these are scottish terriers .
he really wants that sargassum .
teacher : well done . very good ...
now , already in the case of the brain disorders that i &apos;ve been talking to you about , depression , obsessive compulsive disorder , post-traumatic stress disorder , while we don &apos;t have an in-depth understanding of how they are abnormally processed or what the brain is doing in these illnesses , we have been able to already identify some of the connectional differences , or some of the ways in which the circuitry is different for people who have these disorders .
a lot of urban areas have been converted into parking lots in a sort of indiscriminate use .
to be able to change fences and window guards into flowers , it &apos;s fantastic .
so these all have the property of self-similarity : the part looks like the whole .
but it &apos;s not like that everywhere .
and that would take care of your problem , and that would provide the solution for you . &quot; &quot; so i immediately jumped in my car , went downtown , saw the trailer — it was a small trailer , but under the circumstances , i figured that was the best thing that i could do .
i remember my father receiving anonymous letters saying , &quot; &quot; your daughter is spreading western culture in the honorable societies . &quot; &quot; our car was stoned at one point .
think about it : in 2013 , the second decade of the millennium , if you &apos;re concerned about a cancer diagnosis and you go to your doctor , you get bone scans , biopsies and blood tests .
because egyptians are more optimistic than they have been in years , far less divided on religious-secular lines than we would think and poised for the demands of democracy .
the first thing i &apos;m going to show you is a change between age three and five , as kids learn to understand that somebody else can have beliefs that are different from their own .
now , it turns out that the more egalitarian our relationships , the happier both partners are .
it &apos;s analyzing trends . it &apos;s predicting the future .
it &apos;s quite hard , actually , to get those very small changes .
i don &apos;t need to know that at the end of the year when it &apos;s too late .
they &apos;re absolutely everywhere .
and then what happened ?
and this is how it works : patent holders , inventors that develop new medicines patent those inventions , but make those patents available to the medicines patent pool . the medicines patent pool then license those out to whoever needs access to those patents .
these are cane toads in australia .
because the personal , as you know , is political .
it &apos;s almost more important than their eyesight .
well , this is another trend in the field .
it uses x-rays , x-ray beams , that are rotating very fast around the human body .
this is not the stomping ground of our pleistocene ancestors .
it was like a star trek episode , you know ?
now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us , but we can admire the institutional way in which they &apos;re doing it .
let &apos;s look at spam .
it was , &quot; &quot; why are you doing the work that you &apos;re doing ? &quot; &quot; and so often their answer would be , &quot; well , because somebody told me i &apos;m supposed to . &quot;
and the concept is to create a kind of onion , a kind of structure in layers .
that machine doesn &apos;t care about the environment , about racism , about all these issues that make this life worse for all of us , and so the government does have a role to take resources from more productive uses , or from richer sources , and give them to other sources .
and then here &apos;s senegal — it &apos;s got a higher level of social progress than chad , but the same level of gdp .
so , visualizing information can give us a very quick solution to those kinds of problems .
we &apos;re going to do that very soon .
( laughter ) now it &apos;s just the way it is .
so that &apos;s where we are today , and that &apos;s what i wanted to give you a flavor of .
so you have less waste , and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign as it is with cow dung .
and for the past 23 years , at an increasing rate , we &apos;ve been pouring more and more ideas and capabilities and so on into mathematica , and i &apos;m happy to say that that &apos;s led to many good things in r &amp; d and education , lots of other areas .
( laughter ) but we don &apos;t have gta because , maybe it &apos;s my own reflection , i &apos;ve never been able to do anything but crashing cars and shooting prostitutes and pimps .
i think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time , thereby conserving mating time and energy .
what made me do it ? at school , i will admit this : academically , i couldn &apos;t express myself .
and of that stuff , what do you actually use ?
it never happened .
so close your eyes for a minute .
it goes down to 15 degrees centigrade from 35 , and comes out of this perfectly fine .
much of my life has been a quest to get some answers to these questions .
there were markets in africa before the colonialists stepped foot on the continent .
three days later , after everybody has left the home , my mom went and brought a nurse .
thank you .
11-year-olds cannot do simple addition , they cannot construct a grammatically correct sentence .
i started building this project when i was about 12 or 13 years old .
he says , &quot; &quot; i feel bad about the polar bears .
of course , they covered that with make-up , because lara croft did all those same stunts — but she doesn &apos;t get black and blue , because she has sprezzatura .
this little guy is called the kinesin , and he pulls a sack that &apos;s full of brand new manufactured proteins to wherever it &apos;s needed in the cell — whether it &apos;s to a membrane , whether it &apos;s to an organelle , whether it &apos;s to build something or repair something .
so there &apos;s a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic and that analogy is the electric industry .
but to me , they are fascinating objects to visually narrate a story .
and one of the most tedious ones , i think , was saying that beauty was about symmetry .
and even if they were able to do so , even if i &apos;m wrong , it &apos;s extremely unlikely the taliban would invite back al-qaeda .
and i think if we can do that , we might be able to fundamentally change not only human beings &apos; sense of their own agency and power — because i think that &apos;s the most wonderful thing about new power , is that people feel more powerful — but we might also be able to change the way we relate to each other and the way we relate to authority and institutions .
give us a few pages out of your playbook about what someone who is inspired about their city can do to take on projects like yours ?
and so , like many people , we start with a house on a lot , and i &apos;m going to show you a typical construction on the top and what we &apos;re doing on the bottom .
they &apos;ve never been dived . &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; yeah .
what glamour is all about — i took this from a blurb in the table of contents of new york magazine , which was telling us that glamour is back — glamour is all about transcending the everyday .
and there &apos;s opportunities in a circular economy .
and then as you enter it again , looking in all directions towards the city .
for example , xcl technologies , they developed two of the mission critical systems for the new boeing 787 dreamliner , one to avoid collisions in the sky , and another to allow landing in zero visibility .
i believe that everyday soundscape can be the most unexpected inspiration for songwriting , and to look at this idea a little bit more closely , i &apos;m going to talk today about three things : nature , language and silence — or rather , the impossibility of true silence .
and it has led me to think that perhaps these questions are the ones that propel people to cross the line , and that some affairs are an attempt to beat back deadness , in an antidote to death .
there have actually been 22 species of hominids that have been around , have evolved , have wandered in different places , have gone extinct .
the battle against corruption exacts a toll on ourselves , our families , our friends , and even our kids .
it &apos;s not , perhaps , the dimensions appreciated by art critics or architecture critics or city planners .
thank you .
this is the disney hall — the concert hall .
and i was particularly fascinated with sharks .
the civil defense programs were disconnected from the reality of what we &apos;d see in all-out nuclear war .
i don &apos;t know , and i should .
the average boy now watches 50 porn video clips a week .
we &apos;re about to ride the wave of technological opportunity .
or that we require kids to sit still too much , and so boys initially feel like failures ?
and so this is after a day and about half a night smelting this iron .
today , these roads that interconnect our world are dominated by cars and trucks that have remained largely unchanged for 100 years .
but here &apos;s the thing : we are the only advanced civilization in the solar system , but that doesn &apos;t mean that there is no microbial life nearby .
we are here to dream together .
now to some , this was an audacious goal , because our school is located in the brownsville section of brooklyn — one of the most underserved and violent neighborhoods in all of new york city .
a recent study in the archives of surgery reported surgeons removing healthy ovaries , operating on the wrong side of the brain , carrying out procedures on the wrong hand , elbow , eye , foot , and also mistakes born out of thinking errors .
obviously , it &apos;s difficult to calculate .
the first one was actually two hours .
( applause ) can we cue the music please ? ( applause )
so , as a bottom-of-the-rung architecture graduate , i might expect to earn about 24,000 pounds .
this is a facility dedicated to the next generation of aviation fuels using halophytes .
why the need for accumulating money , then doing philanthropy ?
what we &apos;ve found is a whole range of new viruses in these individuals , including new viruses in the same group as hiv — so , brand new retroviruses .
i only need two things .
this is in 1960 .
it all comes back to those ones and zeros .
but the real secret i think lies more in the way that they organize their society .
today , i don &apos;t write the translation of the message anymore on the wall .
that &apos;s what art is for .
this is systemic causation .
now you look at a master &apos;s student , a little further along in their education , and you see they know a bit more , but it &apos;s been narrowed somewhat .
so , what is to be done ?
and it ends like this : &quot; &quot; this telegraph is a fantastic instrument to diffuse religion , civilization , liberty and law throughout the world . &quot; &quot; those are nice words . but i got sort of curious of what he meant with liberty , and liberty for whom .
i found these little bits of glass .
charlie : not in my book , it isn &apos;t .
lotte reiniger , an amazing shadow puppeteer in the 20s , that started doing more elaborate things .
we collect data on animal populations , analyze complex patterns , try to explain them .
lewis , have the courage to go in there , because we are going to look after you every moment of it . &quot; &quot; and i just , i got so much confidence from him saying that , because he knew me so well .
india , the largest democracy in the world , 94 and dropping .
greenpeace and other organizations put that number in the tens of thousands .
devices like this will bring 3d holographic content right into our world , enhancing the way we experience life beyond our ordinary range of perceptions .
we never succeeded in using ten fingers , but there are certain things you can do , obviously , with more than one-finger input , which is rather fascinating .
last i heard we had 93 percent accepted to college .
then we could all be engaged in helping .
my goal is to be able to travel and do things that are simple to you .
it &apos;s clear that multilateral cooperation is essential .
this is the former trolley terminal that was the depot for passengers traveling over the williamsburg bridge from brooklyn to manhattan , and it was open between 1908 and 1948 , just around the time when my grandparents were living right in the area .
and i have one right here .
introduction of red down here , when whales are being cut up .
age is another thing when our attitude toward our appearance changes .
and according to that theory , it &apos;s already too late to avoid a disaster , because if it &apos;s true that our best option at the moment is to prevent co2 emissions with something like the kyoto protocol , with its constraints on economic activity and its enormous cost of hundreds of billions of dollars , or whatever it is , then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure .
now i eat whenever i &apos;m hungry , and i &apos;ve lost 10 pounds .
then in early 2007 , a really interesting thing happened .
you see that enough in the media .
so kids don &apos;t have as hard of a time with this , and i saw in my own son , i gave him this book .
now in a sense , when we think about the effect of video games on the brain , it &apos;s very similar to the effect of wine on the health .
it &apos;s an accelerated view , where you can see the robot actually carrying out some of its replication process .
we know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like .
paint is all low-volume chemical , which is very important when you &apos;re working in the room all the time .
i had a bit of an epiphany being lost in pennsylvania , and i took a left turn trying to get back to the highway .
when we have a bad idea , the response to a bad idea is not no ideas , it &apos;s not to stop thinking .
a person can come in and take somebody else &apos;s gown , cut off three inches from the bottom , go to the e.u. and register it as a new , original design .
ka : obviously , what you faced in trying to do something as substantial as this project — and this is only one of four that you &apos;ve designed to surround the site — you must have run up against the incredibly byzantine , entrenched bureaucracy and powers that be in new york real estate and new york politics .
i &apos;m being told which part of the stick to use .
there &apos;s the solar panels of the cell , some switches that turn your genes on and off , the girders of the cell , motors that move your muscles .
out of that empathy , he spun a whole new field , played a major role in getting medicine to acknowledge pain in and of itself .
when the participants arrived for their interview , i offered them a set of drinks : coke , diet coke , sprite — seven , to be exact .
on the other , every time you turned to your phone , there is this deluge of insults .
it wasn &apos;t the resume of breaking this record here , it was more like , who had i become ?
and there was a project with , funded by the national science foundation — sent a bunch of scanners , and the american libraries were supposed to send books .
i know i should mention : i &apos;m making all these things .
is it just the wind or a dangerous predator ?
we see this in the public sector as well .
( laughter ) we tore everything down and buried it in his backyard .
it lives in our oceans and in freshwater ponds .
( applause ) in my very last example — i do a lot of my work using speech recognition software .
now failure to produce enough insulin is incompatible with life .
it challenges the norms .
if we perceive it in this way as a brand , or other ways of thinking at it like this , we will not resolve or counter terrorism .
that &apos;s where dinosaur origins is to be found : at the bottom of the cliff .
this is a more interesting one where half faces were shown to some people , and then to add them into a list of most beautiful to least beautiful and then exposing a full face .
thank you very much . ( applause )
for reference , fact one : exxon &apos;s revenues in 2005 were a billion dollars a day .
but now you &apos;ve got this virus in there , and we don &apos;t know what the long-term effects of that are .
so where do we go now ?
sighted astronomers depend on this kind of plot in order to interpret how this light intensity changes over time .
and again , closely related to inequality .
they all bitched about each other . i mean , quite gossipy , those cables . okay , but i thought it was a very important point for all of us to grasp , these are human beings just like us . they don &apos;t have special powers .
so what we really want to focus on is the long-run evolution of wealth inequality , and what &apos;s going to happen in the future .
and it is always extraordinary to see a thing of beauty .
so , good things come out of , you know , incomprehension — ( laughter ) — which i will do a painting of , and then it will end up in my work .
so if you were there 3.3 million years ago , to hear when this girl was crying out for her mother , she would have sounded more like a chimpanzee than a human .
umar also has polio .
and so , we wanted to know , how green could we be ?
didn &apos;t know how on earth i &apos;d ever pass a medical .
it was sensitive , we had to go up the chain of command , convince them that this was the right thing to do and do all of this on electronic medium .
i have to say , this sounds awesome . ( laughter ) i could totally have used this 10 minutes ago .
so that &apos;s where we stand at the moment , and i &apos;ve just got a few final thoughts , which is that this is another way in which biology is now coming in to supplement chemistry in some of our societal advances in this area , and these biological approaches are coming in in very different forms , and when you think about genetic engineering , we &apos;ve now got enzymes for industrial processing , enzymes , genetically engineered enzymes in food .
so she &apos;s even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn &apos;t stupid , even though she thought she could look stupid .
we &apos;re not the only ones .
this is the result of my hobby , which is unofficial bin inspections . ( laughter ) strange you might think , but if we could rely on corporations to tell us what they were doing in the back of their stores , we wouldn &apos;t need to go sneaking around the back , opening up bins and having a look at what &apos;s inside .
sp : the imprisonment of nonviolent drug offenders and the toleration of rape in our nation &apos;s prisons .
and that is me , going to , hurrying to uganda , to try to save that 4,000 material , with people carrying them on the bikes , bicycles .
this is autumn 1989 , and imagine that all those people standing up and protesting for change had a mobile phone in their pocket .
it &apos;s a free swimming shark with a satellite tag jumping after salmon , sending home its data .
so where does this leave us ?
so , about three years ago i was in london , and somebody called howard burton came to me and said , i represent a group of people , and we want to start an institute in theoretical physics .
i would argue , only government is capable of creating these necessary conditions for economies to thrive .
and the acoustic habitat of the north atlantic right whale has been reduced by up to 90 percent .
so , basically in 2002 there were 1,200 dancing bears .
this is a black coral called leiopathes , an image taken by my colleague , brendan roark , about 500 meters below hawaii .
but , in fact , you can start , even though we haven &apos;t trained this neocortical column to create a specific reality .
they claim to be psychics , or sensitives , whatever they can .
but we &apos;ve got an opportunity to recycle them into something more useful that enables us to get energy all of the time .
well , suffice it to say it &apos;s not all like that , but that &apos;s part of it .
ca : what , to power — for lighting and stuff ?
i love my mother , but she thought i was wasting my life with this museum stuff .
and i &apos;m sure buckminster fuller would be very , very proud to see a bamboo geodesic dome .
but it &apos;s an animal that &apos;s about 98 percent in decline throughout most of its range .
and today , less than five years in , kiva &apos;s facilitated more than 150 million dollars , in little 25-dollar bits , from lenders and entrepreneurs — more than a million of those , collectively in 200 countries .
it &apos;s not the same thing as good , better and best .
he felt it . he lived it .
i was past 40 when my father died .
they &apos;re big , hot planets that are easy to see .
the managers and the security guards , on the other hand , did not find it particularly funny .
what we need to do is to use our ingenuity and our scientific knowledge to try to design a new generation of treatments that are targeted to specific neurons and specific regions of the brain that are affected in particular psychiatric disorders .
we &apos;ve only just begun to analyze all of this data .
so we took a drug that is already known and by just delivering it locally where it &apos;s needed the most , we allow a response that is 12 times more powerful , reducing the systemic toxic effect .
it &apos;s sort of called a meta-motivational theory about how we look , a theory about motivation and the mood we &apos;re in and how the mood we &apos;re in determines the things we like or dislike .
what it means is all the guys were lying about their height .
and the chinese then , in one of their periods of media openness , decided that they were going to let it go , that they were going to let this citizen reporting fly .
and we wanted to push the idea of the music video that was meant for the web beyond the four-by-three or sixteen-by-nine window and try to make it play out and choreograph throughout the screen .
and how big a problem is this ?
it makes for an exotic and chilly commute .
the final project i &apos;ll talk about is one that &apos;s very close to my heart , and it involves an economic and social value that is associated with epiphytic plants .
but what if we get it right ?
and that &apos;s why helium &apos;s called helium .
it &apos;s usually presided over by religious leaders and village elders , and jirgas are often used in rural countries like afghanistan , where there &apos;s deep-seated resentment against the formal system .
at the lower end of the scale , you find a rigid sequence , a sequence of all a &apos;s , and you also find a computer program , in this case in the language fortran , which obeys really strict rules .
now think about it . this is an amazing thing : that in this frequency range where whales communicate , the main source globally , on our planet , for the noise comes from human ships , thousands of human ships , distant , far away , just all aggregating .
pigs have dna .
so if this is now , and that &apos;s the past , and we start thinking about change , you know , all governments are seeking change , you &apos;re here seeking change , everybody &apos;s after change , it &apos;s really cool . ( laughter ) so what happens is , we get this wonderful whooshing acceleration and change .
if they don &apos;t know , who are the people trying to influence the decision , how much clout do they have , how much they care about this issue , and what do they say they want , are they experts ? that &apos;s what it means to be an expert , that &apos;s the basic stuff an expert needs to know .
and the thing that &apos;s so unique about our species is that we &apos;re really designed to play through our whole lifetime .
so when i came back there , i found these two kids , eight- and 12-year-olds , who were playing a game on the computer .
we &apos;ll go into areas we have no knowledge of .
so what we did is we took all the books — we just ordered them by time — for each book we take the words and we project them to the space , and then we ask for each word how close it is to introspection , and we just average that .
based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness , cognitive behavioral therapy , &#91; very &#93; strong for our well being .
it &apos;s practiced , it &apos;s no anesthesia , it &apos;s a rusty old knife , and it was difficult .
corals are born in a number of different ways , but most often by mass spawning : all of the individuals of a single species on one night a year , releasing all the eggs they &apos;ve made that year into the water column , packaged into bundles with sperm cells .
the third step , following the second step , is to create new mental habits .
lp : yeah , absolutely .
in germany , they made one small change without checking with me — nor did they have to , because it was done through agencies — but see if you can tell the difference .
how do we know that all those graphs , all that progress , is enough to solve what you showed in the first part ?
take a look at this plant .
so this is the end of a ph.d. project from one of the best robotics institutes .
why did it fail miserably ?
sometimes , you get disease organisms that don &apos;t rely on host mobility at all for transmission .
here &apos;s a slide of the first 1,000 digits of this prime .
it &apos;s now home to alma , the large telescope that &apos;s being developed there .
she argued and argued , and finally she struck lucky when a researcher came through town studying the history of mines in the area , and she told him her story , and at first , of course , like everyone , he didn &apos;t believe her , but he went back to seattle and he did his own research and he realized that she was right .
it &apos;s a very logical plan , but it was not always like this .
with a brain the size of a peanut , they maintain individualized , long-term social bonds , we didn &apos;t know that was possible .
empathy and respect . empathy and respect .
most of us got put in front of a disciplinary council , and were rejected from the communities that we loved because we wanted to make them better , because we believed that they could be .
as susan cain said in her &quot; &quot; quiet &quot; &quot; book , in a chapter that featured the strange canadian professor who was teaching at the time at harvard , i sometimes go to the men &apos;s room to escape the slings and arrows of outrageous extroverts .
he suspected an outbreak that concentrated would probably involve a single point source .
let &apos;s first at least decide what is it we &apos;re trying to achieve . &quot; &quot; so with a lot of push and pull and debate , haryana set itself a goal which said : by 2020 , we want 80 percent of our children to be at grade-level knowledge .
and that rover will be more kind of like a chemist .
we also think that individuals can make a difference , and they should , because individuals , together , we can all help create a movement .
aging : the problem is enormous , 300,000 broken hips per year ; but the solutions are extraordinary , and they include so many different things .
we &apos;ve been asking it here at ted already .
so governments who are failing , who are dropping the ball at a national level , have even less ability to get their arms around the problem at an international level .
that &apos;s understandable and important .
and you can see an image produced by this consortium .
and we &apos;ve reached that time . we cannot afford to underestimate this problem . if we face irreversible and catastrophic consequences , we must act , and we must act decisively .
soldiers have a name for these clips .
doaa was sitting with her legs crammed up to her chest , bassem holding her hand .
there are political food fights .
take the first step , as soon as life appeared on this earth .
it &apos;s the best return on investment they ever received . ( laughter ) ca : and the best news of all , i guess , is this .
it has to decide whether to turn around and stay in the same odor , or whether to cross the midline and try something new .
let &apos;s put it that way .
and i &apos;ve put the formula up there .
but as far as we know , we &apos;re the only upright-walking ape that exists on planet earth today , except for the bonobos .
so if the world is not as it seems and we see things as we are , then what we call reality is a kind of hallucination happening inside here . it &apos;s a waking dream , and understanding that that is what we actually exist in is one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history .
( applause )
in chapter seven , i focus on the effects of a genocidal act on one bloodline .
and an interesting thing happened : the jacques cousteau shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on earth .
it &apos;s a perfect world .
they only know the moments that make up their story , even when the book is closed .
my seduction into the world of fireflies began when i was back in graduate school .
teacher : do not pay any attention to what anybody else is doing .
in san ramon , california , they published an iphone app in which they allow you or me to say we are certified cpr-trained , and then when someone has a heart attack , a notification goes out so that you can rush over to the person over here and deliver cpr .
we were all scared and confused .
for starters , there are two things we can all do .
however , there is an underlying argument about logistics , which has driven so much of this debate . right ?
that &apos;s a huge problem .
do you live in a more walkable city or do you live in a less walkable city , or where in your city do you live ?
and now libya as you see it .
but our multitasking reality is pretty different , and full of tons of information .
the rest of us are meant to feel like amateurs in the sense of suckers .
and everybody &apos;s a narrator , because everybody has a story to tell .
now , i am going to show you how my bow works .
and the way i think about this is that healthcare is like any other system .
it started as a means of self-expression .
so it &apos;s not obvious how it leads to inflation in the country doing the actual printing unless it leads to a currency depreciation of that country .
in a region famous for the soft , porous loess plateau soil , there lived until recently an estimated 40 million people in these houses underground .
maybe you want to invest in a stock market of things .
then you &apos;re going to paste them where it makes sense for you to place your own statement .
so what &apos;s goliath ? he &apos;s heavy infantry , and his expectation when he challenges the israelites to a duel is that he &apos;s going to be fighting another heavy infantryman .
in a nutshell , that &apos;s what i was trying to do with these things , but more importantly , that &apos;s what the past 30 years of music has been .
there &apos;s something terrible happening . &quot; &quot; and she said , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t be so silly . &quot; &quot; and i started to cry .
so when i was eight years old , a new girl came to join the class , and she was so impressive , as the new girl always seems to be .
but what might feel just right for that middle-aged executive can be a problem for an adolescent who needs to develop face-to-face relationships .
lassa virus is a lot like ebola .
not the kind of librarian that takes her glasses off , lets her hair down , suddenly she &apos;s smoking hot .
and i cut it into smaller questions , and i have the answer to these smaller questions .
( music : &quot; &quot; flight of the bumblebee &quot; &quot; ) ao : or another one ? how about in g minor ?
salman rushdie was pissed-off i think because i altered the map of new york , if you notice .
in sweden we read it once and then we went partying .
those half of you , roughly , who are women , at some point may have had a pregnancy test .
you can see the lgbt community is not really getting along with the geek community that well , the arts community , the music community .
and i did everything i could to spend my time , every waking hour possible trying to hound these guys , hanging out and having beers and workouts , whatever it was .
so , this is an example of a device made from a simple piece of paper .
rb : well , i like to think it stands for quality , that you know , if somebody comes across a virgin company , they — ca : they are quality , richard . come on now , everyone says quality . spirit ?
so he got volunteers to go move to cuba and live in tents and be voluntarily infected with yellow fever .
and you can see the red dots , in this particular patient &apos;s case , were finger sticks , which would have missed both ends .
i had so many examples — i have so many instances like this , when i &apos;m writing a story , and i cannot explain it .
and i think that &apos;s a really damaging and dangerous narrative that we have , that allows these types of things to happen , as the general public just kind of turns a blind eye to it .
so i &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; cool . i can do whatever the hell i want , since it &apos;s my responsibility and i gotta maintain it . &quot; &quot; and this is how i decided to maintain it .
( laughter ) i &apos;m also a software engineer , and i make lots of different kinds of art with the computer .
here &apos;s the thing : everybody loves a beautiful baby .
so what you &apos;re seeing on the left is a touch device .
what would be your reason ?
i now decide where i &apos;m going to be in that space , so i &apos;m down on this small part of the bottom rib of the letter &quot; &quot; e , &quot; &quot; and i &apos;m thinking about it , and i &apos;m imagining this space that &apos;s really high and above . if i asked you to reach out — you don &apos;t have to literally do it , but in mind — reach out to the top of the &quot; &quot; e , &quot; &quot; where would you reach ?
they have to be able to act along with their fellow actors in the production .
they &apos;re not very animated . ( laughter ) this was the fourth take , i &apos;m told . ( laughter ) okay . so , as we &apos;re talking about cambridge , let &apos;s now move on to technical advancements , because since we started putting this technology on mobile phones less than 12 months ago , the speed and the processing in these devices has grown at a really phenomenal rate , and that means that i can now take cinema-quality 3d models and place them in the world around me , so i have one over here .
so breaking things back down and delivering smartly , elegantly , sophisticated solutions that take into consideration the entire system and the entire life of the thing , everything , all the way back to the extraction through to the end of life , we can start to actually find really innovative solutions .
he was in some sort of catatonic state where he could be aware of his surroundings , but couldn &apos;t even blink to indicate that he was alive .
but i don &apos;t believe in hope without endeavor .
it was a very , very terrifying situation .
and because of that , as grain changes hands — and i &apos;ve measured that it changes hands four , five times in its trajectory from the farmer to the consumer — every time it changes hands — and i &apos;ve seen this all over rural africa — it also changes sacks .
so these two devices , drivegrip and speedstrip , are very effective .
in fact , when i know the data that &apos;s being shared and i &apos;m asked explicitly for my consent , i want some sites to understand my habits .
so i just put the paper on the focal length , which was an etching print , then i got the portrait of &#91; the &#93; sun from sunlight .
my lab started working on this , and i want to show you the result .
i &apos;ve lost count of how many times people of all sizes have told me that the show has changed their lives , how it helped them shift their relationship to their own and other people &apos;s bodies , and how it made them confront their own bias .
and also , one year , the g3 bondi blue thing — that caddy would come out , like , dangerous , like , &quot; &quot; whack , &quot; &quot; like that .
it &apos;s an extraordinary change .
or it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be .
today &apos;s cybercriminal , what do they look like ?
so , all we would need to do is to fit a small microchip to every potential illumination device .
when we look at a map of los angeles or london , it is hard to believe that as of 2005 , only 15 percent of the world was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail .
nowhere in the world do women earn the same as men .
it &apos;s almost like ...
and some things look very familiar today .
in other words , we have possibly stumbled upon the holy grail of modern day planetary exploration , or in other words , an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms .
egos , systems of government — figuring it out — massive change .
in the tool that we &apos;ve built , what we did was we collected 1.5 million cases from all around the united states , from cities , from counties , from every single state in the country , the federal districts .
bogota , where mayor mockus , when he was mayor , he introduced a transportation system that saved energy , that allowed surface buses to run in effect like subways , express buses with corridors .
people have created and invested millions of dollars into non-profit organizations with the mission of helping people who are poor .
&quot; &quot; i don &apos;t know . you know ?
by 2010 , college graduates , if you said two circles followed by a semicircle , two sixteens followed by what , they would say eight , because eight is half of 16 .
he was clearly embarrassed .
we object to genetically engineered food .
ok . now . if something absorbs the energy , the electron can travel .
the name is a misnomer .
what happens is , they burn into flash memory the software , and then test them for a few hours .
and a small indulgence , like eating one scoop of ice cream , is more likely to lead to a food binge in controlled eaters .
and essentially , the story is this with right whales , that about a million years ago , there was one species of right whale on the planet , but as land masses moved around and oceans became isolated , the species sort of separated , and today we have essentially two distinct stocks .
ca : just between us . ( laughter ) em : i made that bet , i think , two or three years ago , so in roughly 18 years , i think we &apos;ll see more power from solar than any other source .
with all these things i &apos;ve been learning about the food system , it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer , or we can pay the hospital .
these are the faces of the children that i have tested with stories just like justin .
and there &apos;s some younger clones dotting the landscape behind it .
milo : what do they want to come here for anyway ?
now my adviser &apos;s concern was what if the penile wall tissue is just the same as any other hydrostatic skeleton .
and before you know it , any social cause can be actually financed in this way .
but long term — i didn &apos;t mean that .
has a direct effect on what happens in my country — as we in london saw in the 7 / 7 bombings .
the director of sports who &apos;s responsible for getting her into the program asks her to come out of class .
i &apos;m not sure what it was . might have been gas .
our boat crashing onto the rocks , i slipped into the water and destroyed my camera , whatever i had documented .
but it did lead to newton discovering gravity .
you may remember that we were talking about a super-massive star that became a very strong magnetic field magnetar .
if you want to find the big new ideas , it &apos;s often difficult to find them in mainstream markets , in big organizations .
and while it &apos;s growing , all these literal transformations are taking place .
one reason is they are always comparing india with china .
it has photonic crystals on its surface , according to people who studied it , which are extremely sophisticated crystals .
and the next year it shipped running on something new called an apple ii personal computer .
but each bag we &apos;d sell would provide a year &apos;s worth of school meals for one kid .
when i was about three or four years old , i remember my mum reading a story to me and my two big brothers , and i remember putting up my hands to feel the page of the book , to feel the picture they were discussing .
and now they &apos;re all in here .
robust systems are also fault tolerant and fail-safe .
the year after it was finished in 2004 , you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months .
that &apos;s not the novel part .
it &apos;s called cannonau .
once you start cutting things in half , you kind of get carried away , so you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan .
we &apos;re awfully careful in the lab to try and avoid various biohazards .
the membrane is translucent .
we back so far up we &apos;re finally seeing a containment around us — the afterglow of the big bang .
and this is a static culture .
for example , the one on the left here allows me to add a little bit of reverb to my sound , which gives me that — ( trumpet ) — flavor .
as you know , an animation is a series of images .
we went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on .
i have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation .
( laughter ) which just resulted in a fantastic photograph . ( laughter )
the students were just scared : scared to sit in rows in fear that something would happen ; scared because they were often teased in the cafeteria for eating free food .
it &apos;s like , why didn &apos;t i follow up on that ?
and this is a picture of hong ngu , vietnam today .
one woman i talked to , who also told a joke that landed badly , she stayed home for a year and a half .
there &apos;s something sacred about a space where you can work on a project , and you don &apos;t have to justify to anyone that it &apos;s going to make a lot of money , that it &apos;s going to save mankind , or even that it &apos;s feasible .
the real trouble comes when pregnant women are , in a sense , unreliable narrators , when fetuses are led to expect a world of scarcity and are born instead into a world of plenty .
it turns out , it &apos;s hopeful . it &apos;s hopeful .
but sometimes i try to put myself in an evil man &apos;s position .
obviously a really profound moment , and it changed our lives in many ways .
and there were lots of widows and orphans , people like that , who needed a foster home .
so , i like to use them .
well , this happens to be the most important painting we have in italy by leonardo da vinci , and look at the wonderful images of faces that nobody has seen for five centuries . look at these portraits .
in the decades to come , 75 percent of the world &apos;s population will live in cities , and 50 of those cities will be of 10 million people or more .
we can use technology for transparency , and many other things .
if some of you play chess , you &apos;ll know that 64 is a square number , and that &apos;s why chessboards , eight by eight , have 64 squares .
and now , together , what we can see on this ocean of color that &apos;s temperature , we can see ten-day worms of makos and salmon sharks .
and the last suggestion i have is that , if you do have a meeting coming up , if you have the power , just cancel it .
now , i know that there are family feuds .
until i got to my house , where the client was my wife .
so , effectively we created a digital puppet that brad pitt could operate with his own face .
some of them are agglomerating together to form larger particles .
and how do you make it simple ?
and that wasn &apos;t the goal . it wasn &apos;t the point . right ?
they &apos;ve also saved me from my righteous anger by offering insights into this third way .
the glacial silence we have experienced in the face of the shredding of the constitution , the unraveling of our public institutions , the deterioration of our infrastructure is not limited to the universities .
virtually every society has ingested psychoactive substances to deal with pain , increase our energy , socialize , even commune with god .
and they started slashing away at the back of the camels , and they started galloping .
and actually this last guy here said a phrase a few years ago that i think fits perfectly to the situation of rio winning the olympic bid .
when yared was seven years old his father died , and his mother sent him to go live with an uncle , who was a priest of the ethiopian orthodox tradition , one of the oldest churches in the world .
we tend to meet disclosure with disclosure , even with strangers .
the real challenge then , is to try to figure out how we can change rules .
carlos had post-traumatic stress disorder .
it &apos;s the only possible explanation of why humans , if they &apos;re very unlucky , can become grossly obese , in a way that would be totally impossible for any other primate , physically impossible .
what about anyone with body image stuff going on ?
i &apos;m listening to the sound of my voice , my voice on surreptitiously taped phone calls that a supposed friend had made the year before .
but before we pat ourselves too much on the back , we have poured 151 megawatt hours of energy into constructing this house when there was a house there before .
what &apos;s a drug ? a drug is made up of a small molecule of hydrogen , carbon , oxygen , nitrogen , and a few other atoms all cobbled together in a shape , and it &apos;s those shapes that determine whether , in fact , that particular drug is going to hit its target .
thank you . ( applause )
realizing that nyota might get hurt , panbanisha , like any human mother , carefully tugs to get the scissors back .
how much ?
the first is that there is so much more to learn and we &apos;re not making the investment in fully understanding the extent of these sex differences .
and that &apos;s where our goal is — to have something clinically pragmatic to wear .
i want to hold your hand . i want to hold your hand .
so how do we prevent them ?
no helicopter can reach you out there , and no plane can land .
we could make a space for change .
but it wasn &apos;t enough to use the priests .
and if you look at the figures up there , it says that we have a third more mouths to feed , but we need an agricultural production increase of 70 percent .
and i meet them at the university , i also have a few field offices that i set up in various places that provide an immersion in some of the environmental challenges we face .
let me show you some brief clips , so you have a sense for what that actually looked like on the ground .
so maybe &quot; &quot; history doesn &apos;t repeat itself , but sometimes it rhymes . &quot; &quot; today , productivity is at an all-time high , and despite the great recession , it grew faster in the 2000s than it did in the 1990s , the roaring 1990s , and that was faster than the &apos; 70s or &apos; 80s .
one of the works , in fact , so didn &apos;t meet her mark , she had set it out in the trash in her studio , and her neighbor had taken it because she saw its value .
( applause )
in the side effect profile , etc . , you want to see where those genes are turned on .
and i &apos;m in favor , actually . of course i am .
it &apos;s a tool used by those in power against those who have no power .
internationally comparable data on life expectancy , on kids &apos; maths and literacy scores , on infant mortality rates , homicide rates , proportion of the population in prison , teenage birthrates , levels of trust , obesity , mental illness — which in standard diagnostic classification includes drug and alcohol addiction — and social mobility .
so , this is what sristi is saying : &quot; give me a place to stand , and i will move the world . &quot;
he &apos;s back to his normal life .
i wanted to put these people on a pedestal .
so they identified that as a priority , and then they &apos;ve got and recruited now 300 researchers from around the world that are studying that topic , essentially the same topic .
what i really did was i just followed nature , and nature doesn &apos;t know monocultures , but a natural forest is multilayered .
you don &apos;t need to dig down for these chemicals , and we can do things much more efficiently .
that raises another wrinkle when it comes to war and conflict . good guys might play around and work on these as hobby kits , but so might bad guys .
they could not confront myself , with myself as a normal human being .
now , here &apos;s the thing : the subject has no idea what all the patterns mean , but we &apos;re seeing if he gets better at figuring out which button to press .
jabbar : you can , even if you don &apos;t believe in yourself right now .
it &apos;s that we expect them to bring us happiness .
it actually reflects changes in the brain that provide an excellent opportunity for education and social development . thank you . ( applause ) ( applause )
rives : so that &apos;s &quot; &quot; close encounters , &quot; &quot; and the main character is all worked up because aliens , momentously , have chosen to show themselves to earthlings at four in the morning , which does make that a very solid example .
and we &apos;ll have a chance to solve a 3,000 year old dispute .
student 4l : &#91; i decided to &#93; do the shot put and the sponge ball because they &apos;re two totally different weights , and if you drop them at the same time , maybe they &apos;ll drop at the same speed .
if we looked in the world of 1945 and looked at the map of capitalist economies and democratic polities , they were the rare exception , not the norm .
so , the emotional and intellectual profits are huge — the acquisition of leadership , teaching and training principles , the sense of commitment , responsibility , generosity and dedication to others , and the individual contribution to achieve great collective goals .
the largest set piece in the opera is called the system . it &apos;s a series of books .
but what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones .
broadband is not necessary .
right ? why would work tire us if it &apos;s in our nature ?
and right now most of the preparedness is deeply flawed .
and i think this is something really important .
she is an illiterate girl , trained , skilled as a welder .
they don &apos;t feel as if they &apos;re doing something that really matters to them , so they pick up these kinds of activities .
( laughter ) so , nobody would like this .
but you can see the beginning of an idea there , because you can see the word &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; emerging from the &quot; &quot; old . &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what happens .
( applause ) when i went to visit him two days later , he gave me a hug and was crying and thanking me for saving his life .
there &apos;s a cave where all these animal-headed creatures travel between two worlds .
well , it &apos;s simple in the sense that it has fewer neurons , but is that a fair metric ?
jh : are you ripping off somebody else &apos;s avatar with that , sort of — pr : no , no . i didn &apos;t . one of the other guys at work had a fantastic avatar — a female avatar — that i used to be once in a while .
here it says the word &quot; &quot; mathematics . &quot; &quot; but actually , they &apos;re just dots , right ?
their marketing is slightly different .
we have to , we must .
and i ...
so there are 30 wars that are about as deadly as the six days war , but there &apos;s only four wars that are 100 times deadlier — like world war i.
but nobody was really worried about this .
he looks pretty good at this stage .
we collected 200,000 jars of peanut butter and over 365,000 valentine &apos;s day cards .
he just sat there watching me cry for an hour .
this young man posted a video of him abusing his cat on youtube .
he &apos;s just moved house . he &apos;s got no friends .
last january , my company , fark.com , was sued along with yahoo , msn , reddit , aol , techcrunch and others by a company called gooseberry natural resources .
i am very happy and honored to be amidst very , very innovative and intelligent people .
so , it goes from a circle , to a round , to a square , to a figure eight .
to actually make the robot , we take inspiration from two organisms .
in a wimbledon final match , these two guys fight it out .
the last time i heard my son &apos;s voice was when he walked out the front door on his way to school .
the price of human beings across the last 4,000 years in today &apos;s money has averaged about 40,000 dollars .
but what if i lived in a food desert ?
what we say — and i include the most austerely mechanistic among us , which is probably me — what we say is , &quot; &quot; vile monster , prison is too good for you . &quot; &quot; or worse , we seek revenge , in all probability thereby triggering the next phase in an escalating cycle of counter-revenge , which we see , of course , all over the world today .
and so we peer through a legal microscope , and look at everything .
it &apos;s efficient not only because toyota invested in material science but because they invested in behavioral science .
electronics kits are very powerful in that they teach us how things work , but the constraints inherent in their design influence the way we learn .
yeah . totally .
to pretend they &apos;re not a mess when they are a mess .
again , you can do that outside and just let it dry in the air .
first , population growth .
and so far there are only three major sources of that — coal and gas , hydro-electric , which in most places is maxed-out — and nuclear .
and be able to type into wolfram alpha , &quot; &quot; the theory of the universe , &quot; &quot; and have it tell us .
and it just went to prove that storytelling has guidelines , not hard , fast rules .
but the next step is called &quot; &quot; universal responsibility . &quot; &quot; and that is very important — the charter of compassion must lead us to develop through true compassion , what is called &quot; &quot; universal responsibility . &quot; &quot; in the great teaching of his holiness the dalai lama that he always teaches everywhere , he says that that is the common religion of humanity : kindness .
and as she did , other ones came to mind .
elam &apos;s graduates : are they proving this audacious experiment right ?
erinaceous : pertaining to the hedgehog family ; of the nature of a hedgehog .
not at all .
it &apos;s just fabulous . ( laughter ) also , the way i dress has changed .
and i asked him , &quot; &quot; how is it possible to do this ? &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; well , i guess with everything in life , there &apos;s a place of balance . &quot; &quot; and this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point .
a room like this has acoustics , this one very good acoustics .
we even heal them .
i &apos;m going to log in .
we feel we &apos;re on the beginning of a journey of experiment and improvement to turn the studio school idea into something which is present , not as a universal answer for every child , but at least as an answer for some children in every part of the world .
and that , by the way , is why i think men so often wear ties . ( laughter )
that &apos;s a haiti earthquake every eight days .
so we worked hard to refocus our agenda , to maximize efficient mobility , providing more room for buses , more room for bikes , more room for people to enjoy the city , and to make our streets as safe as they can be for everybody that uses them .
and i think this is a really important thing that we do all the time .
here are some selection planes .
and i asked the founder of this effort , called tahrir supplies , how long it took him to go from when he had the idea to when he got started .
and i &apos;m following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as i &apos;m holding the light in the same position , i &apos;m getting the same type of reflection on it — that &apos;s the level of detail i &apos;m going into this thing .
the fuel , like i said , is ceramic inside zirconium fuel rods , and in the event of an accident in one of these type of reactors , fukushima and three mile island — looking back at three mile island , we didn &apos;t really see this for a while — but these zirconium claddings on these fuel rods , what happens is , when they see high pressure water , steam , in an oxidizing environment , they &apos;ll actually produce hydrogen , and that hydrogen has this explosive capability to release fission products .
in fact , if you look just at the upper and northern states in the west , they could do geothermal , or you could look at texas and say , we could lead the nation in the solutions to smart grid .
so , okay .
first of all , i &apos;d like to give you an argument for why that list is complete .
so on the one hand , there was a mocking of authority , but on the other hand , there was a deference towards authority , and these caribbean people had an overbearing obedience towards authority , which is very striking , very strange in a way , because migrants are very courageous people .
sarah smith , who was a mathematics professor at mit , wrote , &quot; &quot; the playful search for beauty was man &apos;s first activity — that all useful qualities and all material qualities were developed from the playful search for beauty . &quot; &quot; these are tiles . the word , &quot; &quot; playful &quot; &quot; is a necessary aspect of our work because , actually , one of our problems is that we have to make , produce , lovely things throughout all of life , and this for me is now 75 years .
would they really have different laws ?
and then we were going to have lunch with the mayor and we were going to have dinner with the most important people in malaga .
i hope that &apos;s a non-controversial statement .
we then take the parks and lay them out as ecological infrastructure .
that awful buzzing sound at night around your ears that drives you absolutely crazy ?
there are lots of people who believe that , and i think it is utter baloney .
we call it &quot; &quot; proofing . &quot; &quot; proofing means to prove that the dough is alive .
so what do you do ?
just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect : when we teach people about the pleasant life , how to have more pleasure in your life , one of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills , the savoring skills , and you &apos;re assigned to design a beautiful day .
( laughter ) a gigantic helmet .
furthermore , there &apos;s an experimental way to tell this theory , apart from the inflationary explanation that i told you before .
what we &apos;re trying to do , or what we believe , because this is how we believe the world really works , is that without the environment you have nothing .
eventually , these technologies will become so powerful that we will use them to know ourselves by deconstructing and reconstructing our own brains .
very next day , i bopped into school with my brand new air jordans , man , i was cool .
and people always say , is that really what you guys are still doing ?
i was there . evel knievel was my friend .
and as you breathe , think about what is in your breath .
tesla , what is 236 multiplied by 501 ?
a couple years ago , i was in south africa on safari .
and we need to be able to build this thing using simple manufacturing techniques and factories that don &apos;t cost us a fortune .
in other words , unlike the word hope , which one could look up in a dictionary and derive origins for , and , perhaps , reach some kind of a consensual use analysis , these are essentially contested concepts .
to begin with , artificial landscapes , which i invented sort of , are used in cinema all the time .
i love to think what they thought , what it was like .
to sort of illustrate that , this diagram emphasizes that if you &apos;ve got a sick person in bed , somebody &apos;s going to be taking out the contaminated materials .
and you have a problem making ends meet .
they &apos;re focusing on very cheap , very easy-to-use tools .
then i &apos;m going tell you about what we , as sex workers , actually want .
( applause )
so this — ( applause ) thank you very much . ( applause ) this is not only useful for stadia . we can use that also in open-air places and streets , and we &apos;ve been working on the city of the future in masdar , which is in the united emirates , abu dhabi .
and geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology .
now just because we have a distributed foot and spines doesn &apos;t mean you can climb vertical surfaces .
you turn a faucet and there is warm water and cold water , and drinkable water .
( laughter ) so that christmas — maybe i &apos;ve got time for this — that christmas i got the mister wizard fun-o-rama chemistry set .
as a person who buys the products .
bernard devauchelle and sylvie testelin , who did the first operation , are studying that .
we use technology to define ourselves by sharing our thoughts and feelings even as we &apos;re having them .
north korea did that to some extent .
you can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted .
the luwak is an asian palm civet .
it is not a fork designed to grab three hors d &apos;oeuvres at a time , which would be useful out in the lobby , i would say .
but we were still missing a critical element .
it &apos;s impossible .
taking that idiom of , as it were , the darkness of the body transferred to architecture , can you use architectural space not for living but as a metaphor , and use its systolic , diastolic smaller and larger spaces to provide a kind of firsthand somatic narrative for a journey through space , light and darkness ?
and it has altered the earth . it covers earth like a skin .
and a clash is going to take place , like on the banks of the indus .
and we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges , to do that which we must do .
researchers at the cdc and other places have increasingly been linking suburban development patterns with sedentary lifestyles .
and most importantly , they show us it &apos;s never too late to change your story .
( laughter ) so it was traumatizing , actually .
we were saying no to something that was very important to them , challenging their code of honor , and hurting them deeply in the process .
and so glaciers are these magnificent beings , and there &apos;s lots of reasons to be obsessed with them , but what i &apos;m particularly interested in is in human-glacier relations .
but lately i have had the opportunity to take a step back and ask myself : &quot; &quot; what is it over the last few years that helped me grow my website , but also grow myself ? &quot; &quot; and i &apos;ve summarized those things , for me personally , as three as .
we &apos;re going to see them more like this , as part of the productive , organic framework of which they are inevitably a part , symbiotically connected .
( beep ) ( beep ) ( beep ) kt : oh , my god !
the colors are codes for the direction , from whether it is back to front or vice versa .
somehow in tickling our eardrum that transmits energy down our hearing bones , which get converted to a fluid impulse inside the cochlea and then somehow converted into an electrical signal in our auditory nerves that somehow wind up in our brains as a perception of a song or a beautiful piece of music .
partly , they &apos;d had a bit of a delay .
you can have winds 20 to 40 miles an hour .
one way to look at it is this .
and there &apos;s the first little cam that drove furby .
you know , they engage .
&quot; &quot; it hurt so much , and i shed some tears , but something inside of me wanted to do this despite his words .
that &apos;s lower than the figure in the united states .
so the people of the gulf have essentially been subsidizing the rest of us through a less-clean environment .
in response , tens of thousands of dissatisfied citizens poured into central kiev to demonstrate against this allegiance .
but losing weight alone will not get you across the finish line with a winning time .
it was just called &quot; &quot; tall horse , &quot; &quot; which was a life-sized giraffe .
so this is the sort of momentum that we &apos;ve got at the moment .
&quot; &quot; naked city &quot; &quot; is a nickname for new york , and &quot; &quot; spleen &quot; &quot; embodies the melancholia and inertia that come from feeling alienated in an urban environment .
so about a hundred years ago , some scientists invented a stain that would stain cells .
and so if i &apos;m going to pursue them , i need to have the capability to go after them , and again , the controls are in how i apply that capability , not that i have the capability itself .
so it could be from writing to our local politician to talking to our boss at work or being the boss at work , or talking with our friends and family , or , quite simply , changing our lifestyles .
( laughter ) you — so it &apos;s — yes , he likes that .
imagine that you slice your body in all these directions , and then you try to put the slices back together again into a pile of data , into a block of data .
so epilepsy patients sometimes need the electrical activity in their brain monitoring .
it &apos;s 23 feet long and just six feet across at its widest point .
the next morning , when she comes again to the so-called clinic , her first patient is waiting for her with her husband .
pure content and pure form , side by side .
so that ice sheet is partly floating , and it &apos;s exposed to the ocean , to the ocean heat .
i looked for temporary materials , like spitting out food — ( laughter ) — sidewalk chalk and even frozen wine .
they also exist as corporate entities .
benki came back to his village full of ideas — new technologies , new research , new ways of understanding what was going on .
it &apos;s been tremendously powerful for consumers .
so it doesn &apos;t matter whether we choose nuclear power or carbon capture and storage , upscale our biofuel production , or go for a much bigger roll-out of wind turbines and wave turbines .
contemplation , meditation , being deep in thought .
i thought i &apos;d begin with a scene of war .
and beyond all that , the chinese have this feeling in their heart of hearts and in their gut of guts that those of us in the collective west are just too damned arrogant .
so wherever you look , the message , it seems to me , is the same : that less is very often more , that slower is very often better . but that said , of course , it &apos;s not that easy to slow down , is it ?
and i realized , of course , this dialogue is definitely not occurring in the public at large .
well , of course , as soon as anybody did look , which was after about 20 years , when radio astronomy really took off . because it turned out the universe is absolutely full of all kinds of wonderful things radiating in the radio spectrum , much brighter than the sun .
i want you to breathe in . this is what i say .
this is a little piano circuit right in here , and this is an ordinary paintbrush that i smashed it together with . ( beeping ) and so , with some ketchup , — ( musical notes ) — and then i can kind of — ( musical notes ) — ( laughter ) ( applause ) and that &apos;s awesome , right ?
and this is the kind of city that &apos;s devoid of smell , devoid of mess , certainly devoid of people , because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape .
i want to argue that though africa is not the front line in the war against terror , it could be soon .
like , oh , i don &apos;t know , tedx usc .
i believe that we all have a vision for healthcare in this country .
suddenly these characters that you &apos;ve fallen in love with become husks of themselves , they &apos;re shadows of themselves .
or vice versa , because they are less productive , we put more pressure and they are less engaged .
thank you .
money is not capital in most of the developing countries .
again , you can &apos;t really see much .
they do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures , many of which are similar , or even identical , to ours and formed in the same context . greeting chimpanzees embracing .

his family lost everything , and at age 11 , he had to live in motels with his dad , motels that would round up all of their food and keep it hostage until they were able to pay the bill .
independent diplomat is now established in five diplomatic centers around the world , and we &apos;re advising seven or eight different countries , or political groups , depending on how you wish to define them — and i &apos;m not big on definitions .
yeah , so what we &apos;d do if we had you who gave the answer as a participant , we would have calibrated the difficulty level of the puzzles to your expertise .
then i got married .
so looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design , interiors and furniture , we came up with the solution of taking an old airstream trailer and gutting it , and trying to portray laminate , and a trailer , in kind of a fresh , new contemporary look .
( applause )
i think that &apos;s very , very important .
frankly , it &apos;s a sector that many of us who work in the field worry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology .
do we have the comparative advantage to use another sort of energy ?
and that experiment was done in northern alabama .
actually , it &apos;s not , it &apos;s actually an important social cue .
and what psychologists and behavioral economists have discovered is that by and large people use two simple rules .
and in a short period of time , the city went to a 30-year crime low .
and i wanted this guy to be involved in my crazy project , and he was kind enough to lend his image to the character of eugène spaak , who is a cosmologist and artist who seeks relation in between time , space , love , music and women .
they had fixed behaviors .
which size ? it &apos;s a piece of cake . i like challenges . which size ?
the advent of the internet definitely helped her .
and in these instances , the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards , from the last word to the first .
the point of the website is that it denounces terrorism while recognizing that it &apos;s ridiculous that we have to constantly denounce terrorism .
right now , we have a quarter of a million people that have signed up for protonmail , and these people come from everywhere , and this really shows that privacy is not just an american or a european issue , it &apos;s a global issue that impacts all of us .
( fussing ) ( laughter ) ls : so you just saw two 15-month-old babies do entirely different things based only on the probability of the sample they observed .
you take these particles . you slam them together .
that &apos;s where his strength lies .
so what you suddenly started to realize — or what i started to realize — is that when you started having conversations with these companies , the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem .
fears also have plots . they have beginnings and middles and ends .
so this came out in a scientific journal a few years ago , but more importantly , it was featured on &quot; &quot; csi : miami , &quot; &quot; so you really know it &apos;s true .
so we could make this problem go away simply by making clean needles universally available and taking away the fear of arrest .
he didn &apos;t have to select that from a menu .
on top of that , we selected some strategic points reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines , and this modified this initial pattern .
how could i have been so blind ?
in general , and maybe , again , it &apos;s because i &apos;m a tech entrepreneur , i look at things as platforms .
and guess what ?
ca : can we take a look at this ?
and there is no way of your being not limitless too .
&quot; ... who said , reach out and touch ... &quot; ( laughter )
they still have to start from scratch every single time , and that &apos;s because they never learn .
eh : you &apos;re a pro .
what i came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell .
go home and ask those questions , and then help the people around you .
my friend adam curtis says that maybe the internet is like a john carpenter movie from the 1980s , when eventually everyone will start screaming at each other and shooting each other , and then eventually everybody would flee to somewhere safer , and i &apos;m starting to think of that as a really nice option .
let me explain why by taking the example from my own career as a filmmaker .
and if you have been looking at the headlines lately , then you will see that we have discovered a subsurface ocean on europa , on ganymede , on enceladus , on titan , and now we are finding a geyser and hot springs on enceladus , our solar system is turning into a giant spa .
now , if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons and fire into this bottle , how will those photons shatter into this bottle ?
according to burrelles , the movie premiered in january , and since then — and this isn &apos;t even the whole thing — we &apos;ve had 900 million media impressions for this film .
only together can we solve these big problems .
so we basically figured out which bones are important for us and collected their motion in 3d .
so what i &apos;m saying is that entrepreneurship is where it &apos;s at .
&quot; why don &apos;t you try ? &quot;
here &apos;s rhex entering the woods .
( laughter ) ( audio ) nr : and i &apos;m thinking , what ? that &apos;s amazing — if it &apos;s true .
as one of them said to me , &quot; ron , we ain &apos;t going anywhere at the moment . &quot;
that problem is solved .
you can see from the slide , very very strong .
pollution , global warming , these things — the consequences are distant in time and space .
it &apos;s an object that behaves like a wave , so that it doesn &apos;t just move in one direction or the other , but can follow multiple pathways at the same time .
and the future , for them , doesn &apos;t look particularly promising — in fact , it &apos;s downright bleak .
they came to earth briefly transformed to stop you from being artistic , from becoming artists .
the length is smaller by eight percent by the way .
and what we can see is that just over these few weeks , we have a much more radical change , a setback of many months of normal development , followed by a relatively rapid recovery , and by the time he reaches day 838 , which is the end of this video , you can see that he has essentially reached the healthy adult stool community , despite that antibiotic intervention .
so how might the airplane of the future look ?
as humans , ultimately being part of the universe , we &apos;re kind of the spokespeople or the observer part of the constituency of the universe .
i &apos;d encountered so much strange love , and i fell very naturally into its bewitching patterns .
no meals on saturday .
that &apos;s fun .
( laughter ) and there was only about 30 to help retire the debt .
through that small little slit between the glass box and the wood , the air goes underneath the sculpture and creates the other one .
and it &apos;s pretty simple .
so it had better be the gist of the gist , right ?
and i went to visit louise bourgeoise , who &apos;s also still working , and i looked at her sink , which is really amazing , and left .
and it was really interesting because i was the last speaker and before me there were people that were really talking about luxury , and i didn &apos;t want to be a party pooper but at the same time i felt that i had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality .
there are nest maintenance workers working throughout the nest .
you didn &apos;t claim to be anything .
we don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
you can &apos;t actually build much on a roof , they &apos;re not designed for that .
it &apos;s tricky .
and even when i first flew in the shuttle back in 1995 , 74 shuttle flight , the odds were still now that we look back about one in 38 or so — one in 35 , one in 40 .
family history says he loved being a fireman , and so in 1938 , on one of his days off , he elected to hang out at the firehouse .
so with very little effort , you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters , which is the same as a chinese eight-year-old .
and here is what we got .
now there &apos;s a problem there , and we &apos;ll come back to it in a minute , which is that if you bring the most powerful together to make the rules in treaty-based institutions , to fill that governance space , then what happens to the weak who are left out ?
and whilst i &apos;m painting i have to be very careful , because the paint starts to turn into little blobs .
anyway , there isn &apos;t . ( laughter ) you don &apos;t need something more to explain something more .
in this nursery , we &apos;re going to grow 10 times more than the number of species .
( &quot; &quot; although it &apos;s nothing serious , let &apos;s keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn &apos;t turn into a major lawsuit . &quot; &quot; ) and we certainly see it in the world of business .
it all feeds in as minute reinforcement .
here is a fact that might surprise you : 413 billion dollars , 413 billion dollars was the amount of remittances sent last year by migrants to developing countries .
just like many of them , i was completely apolitical until 2009 .
and matthew has made this remarkable observation that i &apos;m just going to offer you and let it sit .
weddings were reported to be interrupted so guests could cluster around the t.v. set , and then turn their attention back to the bride and groom .
now i have to confess , when i was a college undergraduate , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex — it seemed pretty reasonable at the time , but with each passing year , i &apos;ve come to have increasing doubts .
which is — you know , like check it out , i &apos;m pretty young , i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
in our accelerated media culture , desertification is simply too slow to reach the headlines .
and for three to four years , i went to university .
and actually , although we &apos;ve got a long way to go and a lot of work to do , i can see the day where my two great passions — cars and the environment — actually come into harmony .
it turned out , the light in that room was slightly different .
well , we decided we were going to create growth charts of social engagement .
but during that entire process , more and more people have been born , and more and more people are moving to cities .
and it &apos;s pretty incredible because i took my iphone there , and he was like , &quot; &quot; yeah , do you want an upgrade ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) i was a bit skeptical , but then , i decided to give him a nokia instead . ( laughter ) but what i was amazed about is this reverse engineering and know-how that &apos;s built into this little two meters of space .
but when it comes to consciousness , questions about behavior are among the easy problems .
in the first phase of this testing , which is called testing for toxicity , it &apos;s called phase i.
i mean these guys are extrapolating in realms that are not necessarily valid .
that is , almost everybody sees the planet saturn .
then finally she said , &quot; &quot; the third thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll never drink alcohol . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) well i was nine years old , so i said , &quot; &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot; &quot; i grew up in the country in the rural south , and i have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger .
these are the rocks kanzi used and these are the flakes he made .
so when we developed glass , we thought really about , can we make something that frees your hands ?
now , when an ecologist looks at the ocean — i have to tell you — we look at the ocean in a very different way , and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean because when an ecologist looks at the ocean , we see all those interconnections .
but you can also talk about sunny places .
my friend , on the other hand , she was a good terrorist because she was very good at following orders .
hey , hey , black-eyed susie ! hey , hey , black-eyed susie !
simply by making it happen .
foremost , it was its enormous power , because it united different functions in one organization .
ra : so now you &apos;re about to see how we do our own movies here , with or without any assistance from anybody .
since 1970 , no human beings have been back to the moon .
and today i will tell you about five of them and their particular features and why these plants are so unique .
and i guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg , or something like that , and then you wait , and , lo and behold , out pops a little baby dinosaur .
then after this , you go to crystal chamber .
and we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards , and we &apos;re destroying the world .
there &apos;s actually more mountains in the ocean than there are on land .
let me highlight a couple of things here in the fake review . the first is that liars tend to think about narrative . they make up a story : who ? and what happened ? and that &apos;s what happened here .
( applause ) i hope you enjoyed mathemagics .
the old man turned to me and he said , &quot; you could pick a red card or a black card . &quot;
but we needed to get a database of him doing more than that .
this is about citizens taking action .
so that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking for developing . ( applause ) and we replace the human being — to go , for example , for measuring radioactivity , you don &apos;t want a human to be sailing those robots — with batteries , motors , micro-controllers and sensors .
imagine if instead of facing that , they could actually face the regeneration of that limb .
tragically , she passed away before he did , and he &apos;s big on delegation , and — ( laughter ) — he said — ca : tweet that .
no , the pioneer is the one who allows himself to throw overboard a lot of ballast .
so my plea today to everyone , especially those who sincerely believe in islamist jihadism ...
and when you use indoor spraying with ddt and those nets you can cut deaths by over 50 percent .
and by the way , this appeal went through after he had finished serving his sentence , so he was out and working at a job and taking care of his family and he had to go back into jail .
that was the only criteria , was that you be — you looked like a gentleman , and they &apos;d let anybody could come .
it feels the force , understands that chris is there and doesn &apos;t push through him and hurt him .
someone is always watching .
consider the ancient greek myth explaining seasons .
it &apos;s just steel and timber .
so it &apos;s reasonable to say that grand crossing is already in the process of being something different than it is today .
facing the given with intent . doing things by design .
this is deeply democratizing .
and this was a hard shot to get — i think this is the shot of the ant foot on the superstrings .
&quot; &quot; there are three sorts of people in the world : those who are immovable , people who don &apos;t get it , or don &apos;t want to do anything about it ; there are people who are movable , people who see the need for change and are prepared to listen to it ; and there are people who move , people who make things happen . &quot; &quot; and if we can encourage more people , that will be a movement .
it &apos;s nearly impossible to get paint to stick to the grease in an egg .
they &apos;re looking for answers to questions , and they want to take action when they &apos;re done , which is really hard to do from a site that looks like this .
and it hadn &apos;t been up for more than a couple hours before i received this exuberant email from the guy who mailed me this postcard .
and our anatomists are going to go in and take a deeper look at this .
that &apos;s really bad for the worker .
the government must be planning a massacre tomorrow . &quot; &quot; i was hit hard on my head .
so in this next experiment , we &apos;re going to give babies just a tiny bit of statistical data supporting one hypothesis over the other , and we &apos;re going to see if babies can use that to make different decisions about what to do .
how to move you with your emotions , but also make your mind work .
a lot of kids were being referred to me for adhd , or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , but when i actually did a thorough history and physical , what i found was that for most of my patients , i couldn &apos;t make a diagnosis of adhd .
in europe alone , by 2050 , there is going to be a 70 percent increase of individuals over 65 , and 170 percent increase in individuals over 80 .
i think they &apos;d make good allies .
it &apos;s going to be a place where people can meet , where you can put nature .

this was scott fischer , rob hall , andy harris , doug hansen and yasuko namba .
another major revolution : the communications revolution .
i got rid of all my poly-cotton t-shirts .
and what he said was that this mindset , this framework discovered by bentham , was the key means of societal control for modern , western societies , which no longer need the overt weapons of tyranny — punishing or imprisoning or killing dissidents , or legally compelling loyalty to a particular party — because mass surveillance creates a prison in the mind that is a much more subtle though much more effective means of fostering compliance with social norms or with social orthodoxy , much more effective than brute force could ever be .
so she &apos;s stunned that he &apos;s standing in a subway station .
you &apos;re probably asking that . why should you care ?
adam ockelford : i promise there won &apos;t be too much of me talking , and a lot of derek playing , but i thought it would just be nice to recap on how derek got to where he is today .
he basically said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve designed everything . &quot; &quot; and also ikko tanaka was a very important mentor in my life — the paul rand of japan . he designed most of the major icons of japan , like issey miyake &apos;s brand and also muji .
&quot; &quot; bring these kids home because they are misled . &quot; &quot; but yes , these youth who have been inspired by universal values , who are idealistic enough to imagine a magnificent future and , at the same time , realistic enough to balance this kind of imagination and the process leading to it — not using violence , not trying to create chaos — these young people , they did not go home .
and eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic .
tell us , charlie , why would you say he should be able to use a golf cart ?
so from that day on , i was an ordinary kid walking around on dry land , but my head was down there , underwater .
these kids are real pros . there were just 7,000 machines out there being tested by kids . being a nonprofit is absolutely fundamental .
again , it &apos;s noisy . they &apos;re playing for dancers .
well , i know the world is flat now .
if you think about it , it &apos;s the very least that we owe our fellow citizens . thank you . ( applause )
they are in this constant state of wonder , and i do firmly believe that we can keep listening like these seven-year-old children , even when growing up .
shortly after i walked into my new school , a huge fight broke out among the girls .
you , your miserableness , have got to be kidding . &quot; &quot; and they say , &quot; &quot; no , no , that &apos;s what it says here in our holy book . &quot; &quot; cut to our century , same country , same pyramids , another people spreading the same idea of equality with a different book .
it does increase security .
what does that mean ?
we ingest nutrients . we excrete nutrients as well .
and then he went and knocked an old lady house .
and you actually did inspire me . i looked at you , i thought , well , he &apos;s made it . maybe there is a different way .

ca : can you give us a sense of what it &apos;s like in those negotiations ?
why have i chosen to talk to you about the phosphorus crisis today ?
but it &apos;s a misconstrual .
there was no time to develop it .
here &apos;s the key feature though . these neurons are also involved in the way you can assign value to literally abstract ideas , and i put some symbols up here that we assign value to for various reasons .
so those three ways — transparency , accountability and choice — will make a huge difference .
but only if i get permission from my dad .
it wasn &apos;t until days later as i lay in a coma that the doctors diagnosed me with bacterial meningitis , a vaccine-preventable blood infection .
how long did it take to go from one system to the next ?
and he cues in a flute player like this .
i thought , at the time , i did a pretty good job .
ak : it works good .
the present encapsulates the past and a promise for the future .
fujifilm survived because it applied the principles of prudence , diversity and adaptation .
i used to carry a big gun .
but in 2008 , there isn &apos;t one single american city that has done effective plans to deal with a nuclear detonation disaster .

be my guest , do your best , harvest me , track the clues .
we don &apos;t really think of the evolutionary need to be protected by our senses , but that &apos;s probably why our senses really evolved — to keep us safe , to allow us to live .
so , you know , this does happen .
my story is the power of thought .
but it was really about the fact that i was looking for a project on my own and there was no open source , really , on my radar at all .
the consequence of that is that all those nutrients that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries , of the sardines of california or in peru or whatever , those slow down and those fisheries collapse .
they &apos;ve created jobs .
so i made sure the work was not compromised in any way and that the integrity of the work remained the same .
months later , she was joking that her husband had threatened to pull her out of the classes , as he found out that his now literate wife was going through his phone text messages .

where does my fish come from ?
the weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion — 10 to the 21st — molecules of isoprene .
i do know that education is a huge part of it .
why do we travel too much ?
so here &apos;s the world , and here we are in bali .
that &apos;s when the dinosaurs went extinct , that &apos;s when 75 percent of the animal and plant species went extinct , and that &apos;s when mammals overtook their ecological niche , and to anthropomorphize , biological evolution said , &quot; hmm , this neocortex is pretty good stuff , &quot; and it began to grow it .
that is how we live .
and i quit .
we need to make the gas price better reflect the real cost of oil .
i call it the idea of tribes .
it &apos;s just never going to happen . &quot; &quot; it took me a couple of days to fully absorb this incident and its implications , but once i did , i reached three conclusions .

i did expect it to be difficult , have sleepless nights , constant feedings , but i did not expect the feelings of isolation and loneliness that i experienced , and i was really surprised that no one had talked to me , that i was going to be feeling this way .
if you want to get to the phoenix islands , it &apos;s five days from fiji , it &apos;s five days from hawaii , it &apos;s five days from samoa .
bg : that &apos;s the most important .
and it seems like every department had nothing , so they had to rely on our creativity and turn every problem into an opportunity .
they &apos;re doing it because they are expecting things to happen .
stem cells provide hope for new beginnings — small , incremental steps , cells rather than organs , repair rather than replacement .
okay , we know how to measure attention in the lab .
and what i &apos;m going to do is to show you pretty much what &apos;s here .
the typical city is more like cedar rapids , where they have an all four-lane system , half one-way system .
it &apos;s a movie . i did &quot; &quot; the tempest &quot; &quot; on a stage three times in the theater since 1984 , &apos; 86 , and i love the play .
it &apos;s a circle of silk on the floor that disappears into the hole in the stage floor .
and space does not exist for most people .
why was it effective ?

we paid a lot of money for that information , be we didn &apos;t get it .
the principle behind the mouthguard is this : it fits onto your teeth .
well my characters , like the ones in my shows , allow me to play with the spaces between those questions .
what africans practiced was a different form of capitalism , but then after independence , all of a sudden , markets , capitalism became a western institution , and the leaders said africans were ready for socialism .

bj : but we truly do spend day and night trying to capture unique footage .
this is version eight of this software , and do you know what they put in version eight ?
the bottom of it is carved from a grain of sand , because i wanted to get a bit of the stone effect .

so , very quickly , what is the optimal time profile ?
it &apos;s now an empty , six-acre lot waiting for a shopping mall right across from the new ikea .
i feel it &apos;s sort of like the vimalakirti sutra , an ancient work from ancient india in which the buddha appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people come to see him from the biggest city in the area , vaishali , and they bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make an offering to him .
you can also bike the tour de france without steroids , right ?
but remember this example .
or taking the time to look at a problem from all angles in the office to make the best decision at work .
here &apos;s a typical south atlantic contact call from the &apos; 70s .
can you imagine ?
now that &apos;s bigger than europe and america put together in today &apos;s money .
and the thing is , if we can put in all the words , no longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad , we can really describe the language like scientists .
this beetle , unlike this chip bag here , this beetle uses one material , chitin .
but unfortunately , as we &apos;re on our way to solving one monstrous problem — and as i said , we &apos;re not there yet ; we &apos;ve got a lot of work to do , but i can see where we will — but even as we &apos;re in the process of doing that , another huge problem is looming , and people aren &apos;t noticing .
anybody , quick ?
well , think about it this way . who changed ?
and so a punch card can hold about 80 characters , and you can fit about 2,000 or so cards into a box , and you put them in , say , my home region of new england , it would cover the entire region up to a depth of a little less than five kilometers , which is about three times deeper than the glaciers during the last ice age about 20,000 years ago .
you could now start doing surgery everywhere , on the gut , on the liver , on the heart , on the brain .
but it doesn &apos;t work , my eyes are still small .
you came back to — nl : radio operator .
the little dust particle will again , reflect the light , and we realize the existence of light .
he wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends who was j.d. hooker , or at that time , president of the royal society , so the maximum scientific authority in britain speaking about the brain in the plants .
if i asked you to picture the air , what do you imagine ?
after about an hour of speaking with jason , he asked us if we knew the story of pandora &apos;s box .
it &apos;s formal . it uses long sentences like this gibbon one .
so you need to help him out .
it is wrong . it is irresponsible .
or polio ? how many of you remember the iron lung ?
look around you — here will do , in this room .
and i had a lot of — always interested in the concept of a crystal ball .
it doesn &apos;t tell us about our dreams and our aspirations .
it &apos;s all just the same thing happening .
thank you so much .
( laughter ) in fact , i ’ m finished . science will never go away .
wonderful as they are , i believe the time has come for us to complement these bulky electronic giants with what nature has already invented : the microbe , a single-celled organism that is itself a self-generating , self-replenishing , living machine .
but the point is , by constantly depicting the state part as necessary but actually — pffff — a bit boring and often a bit dangerous kind of leviathan , i think we &apos;ve actually really stunted the possibility to build these public-private partnerships in a really dynamic way .
so will new power elites just become old power and squeeze ?
the light blue is refugee camps these volunteers had spotted from the &#91; satellite images &#93; .
he says , &quot; &quot; we need more boots on the ground in afghanistan . &quot; &quot; and everyone goes , &quot; &quot; great idea . &quot; &quot; he leaves , people go , &quot; &quot; no no no , we &apos;re not going to do that .
and then we need to pair those medical people with the military .
i photographed for over 30 hours in this picture .
look what they &apos;ve done .
so this perspective is perhaps justified .
these two titles both showed up in the top 50 entertainment titles in pc data — entertainment titles in pc data in december , right up there with &quot; &quot; john madden football , &quot; &quot; which thrills me to death .
we can see tendons and muscles .
and the epitome was when i literally marched into the streets of nyamirambo , which is the popular quarter of kigali , with a bucket , and i sold all these little doughnuts to people , and i came back , and i was like , &quot; &quot; you see ? &quot; &quot; and the women said , &quot; &quot; you know , jacqueline , who in nyamirambo is not going to buy doughnuts out of an orange bucket from a tall american woman ? &quot; &quot; and like — ( laughter ) — it &apos;s a good point .
to tell you about that i have to talk about this fellow here , his name is julius .
( music : &quot; &quot; la di da di &quot; &quot; by slick rick &amp; doug e. fresh ) ( music : &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t stop &quot; &quot; by miley cyrus ) so miley cyrus , who wasn &apos;t even born yet when &quot; &quot; la di da di &quot; &quot; was made , and neither were any of the co-writers on the song , has found this song that somehow etched its way into the collective consciousness of pop music , and now , with its timeless playfulness of the original , has kind of translated to a whole new generation who will probably co-opt it as their own .
when this story was published in the washington post , i started receiving death threats , and i was forced to leave afghanistan , as my parents were .
and as i did so , i started thinking : well , what are we actually looking at here ?
so the question is : how are we all going to respond to this ?
that patient was my government .
what i dispute is the conclusion that so many people draw from them , namely that we &apos;re all screwed because the problems are unsolvable and our governments are useless .
and do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound .
but then , given the way of the world , things change .
what &apos;s trending now ? what &apos;s the popular talk now ?
there &apos;s actually a company in greece that produces these cigarettes that actually contain hemoglobin from pigs in the filter .
i can &apos;t stop this from happening .
like , thoughts and ideas go in , but none ever comes out , i mean at least not that are revealing .
or we can just leave it to fate and continue on with a business-as-usual type of attitude .
( laughter ) a few years later , i heard a joke about the greatest violinist , jascha heifetz .
what you can find there is really evidence of a lost world .
( laughter ) this is not that catchy catchphrase .
i don &apos;t think the legislation is going anywhere , because they realized it is so hard to tell the difference between a pirated design and something that &apos;s just part of a global trend .
so i mean , the reason i put those things all together , ok , here &apos;s the way you &apos;re supposed to do science — some science is done for other reasons , and just curiosity .
and those differences can be biological , physical , functional , political , cultural , socioeconomic .
and so , as we evaluated , and as the dust settled from this tragedy , we realized that , of those two problems — in the initial iteration of our organization , we were a disaster response organization that was using veteran service . we had a lot of success , and we really felt like we were changing the disaster response paradigm .
it &apos;s used to puncture through the ligaments in the spine and deliver anesthesia during childbirth .
so on the same night that barack obama won his historic presidency , the lesbian and gay community suffered one of our most painful defeats .
fast-forward , 2004 : in the peak of our activism , the minister of gender liberia called me and said , &quot; &quot; leymah , i have a nine-year-old for you .
and of course , those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society .
and he did not want to pay .
and the object is the passive no-voice .
recently , at the seattle art museum , isaac bunn and i mounted this exhibition , and the exhibition was used as a platform to launch his voice .
and one doctor said to the others , &quot; &quot; did you see my article in the new england journal of medicine ? &quot; &quot; and the other said , &quot; &quot; no . that &apos;s great . congratulations ! &quot; &quot; the next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said , &quot; &quot; well while you were , you know , doing your research , &quot; &quot; — notice the condescending tone — &quot; &quot; while you were off doing your research , i was off doing more surgeries than anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution . &quot; &quot; and the third one got the same wry smile and said , &quot; &quot; well , while you were off doing your research , and you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery ,
and over that time , i &apos;ve seen a lot of crazy things in the markets , and i &apos;ve traded a lot of crazy manias .
so what we know from this picture is that the labor supply , so people who provide labor , will go down in germany , and will go down significantly .
we gather the world &apos;s only all-female orchestra , we play fantastic music by forgotten or overlooked women composers , we have amazing conductors — it &apos;s marin alsop there from baltimore conducting , petula clark singing — and i give a lecture on women &apos;s history .
( applause ) a long time ago in a galaxy — oops , wrong script .
the car pays for itself .
but if trees can create art , if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year , if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs , then perhaps there are other static entities that we hold inside ourselves , like grief , like addictions , like racism , that can also change .
you do not have to be a professional player to get insights about movement .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
the crowd on the day of weidmann &apos;s execution was called &quot; &quot; unruly &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; disgusting &quot; &quot; by the press , but that was nothing compared to the untold thousands of people who could now study the action over and over again , freeze-framed in every detail .
so , in favor of the proposition , possibly shockingly , is one of , truly , the founders of the environmental movement , a long-standing tedster , the founder of the whole earth catalog , someone we all know and love , stewart brand .
if you look at a map of cartel influence and violence , you will see that it almost perfectly aligns with the most efficient routes of transportation from the south to the north .
october , november , december . that is not the northeast monsoon season .
you want to lose weight in a way that enhances your health rather than the one that harms it .
what are we going to do about it ? i define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity , transparency and empathy , building humanity into communications .
as one woman said , &quot; &quot; i ’ ve got 20 friends in this package of cigarettes , and they ’ re always there for me and nobody else is .
but , if not , there is now high-definition surround sound .
six thousand miles of road , 600 miles of subway track , 400 miles of bike lanes and a half a mile of tram track , if you &apos;ve ever been to roosevelt island .
i call myself a maker of things .
yours is faith .
and what we find is that there &apos;s a wide diversity of performance in the world today .
it doesn &apos;t take lots of technology or biological evolution to be able to do arbitrary computation ; just something that happens , naturally , all over the place .
so this world that we live in , this world in which every conversation has the potential to devolve into an argument , where our politicians can &apos;t speak to one another and where even the most trivial of issues have someone fighting both passionately for it and against it , it &apos;s not normal .
so very small , but very useful .
recording : ♫ hey ♫ ♫ you &apos;re okay ♫ ♫ you &apos;ll be fine ♫ zf : so that &apos;s one of the better ones , really .
( &quot; &quot; intrigue and murder among 16th century ottoman court painters . &quot; &quot; ) ( laughter ) all right , so i got a collection of the paintings together and i looked at them and i deconstructed them and i put them back together .
it said , &quot; &quot; you know , this is a car that has lots of faults .
to 1,200 ? no .
this climber is on the last pitch of it .
the mycelium infuses all landscapes , it holds soils together , it &apos;s extremely tenacious .
the main reasons why people cooperated with the stasi were political conviction and material benefits .
and with a mobile phone , you can record a song , load it up to soundcloud and become famous .
but that made me think about collecting toys , and this thing that &apos;s going on right now in the toy world with blind box toys , and being able to collect these rare toys .
so , how do we rebuild it ?
this idea is nicely captured by this quote : &quot; &quot; things without all remedy should be without regard ; what &apos;s done is done . &quot; &quot; and it seems like kind of an admirable philosophy at first — something we might all agree to sign onto ...
but it was only when i interviewed mario moretti , the head of the red brigades , the man who kidnapped and killed aldo moro , italian former prime minister , that i finally realized that terrorism is actually business .
by 18 , under the excellent tutelage of my mother , i was therefore , as you might expect , defiantly feminist .
and i think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that , over the past couple of decades , we went from the physical world to the digital one .
( applause )
could you give us the money now ?
and then , in the postwar period , you had unusually high growth rate , partly due to the reconstruction .
and a lot of people talk about trucks and moving bees , and that being bad , but we &apos;ve done that for thousands of years .
to his left is his student . she &apos;s six .
now i &apos;m going to show you what that does to our societies .
for more than 10 years , people who were charged with my care abused me physically , verbally and sexually .
and this is the project today , 12 years old , still in best condition .
this is a picture of a maternal health clinic in africa — mothers coming , pregnant and with their babies .
but what we want to propose , is that the highest levels of abstraction , things like mathematics , computing , logic , etc . — all of this can be engaged with , not just through purely cerebral algebraic symbolic methods , but by literally , physically playing with ideas .
but there are two in particular that fascinate me .
netflix — they could so easily have been content with earlier generations of distribution , but they always — and i think they will always — keep pushing for the next battle .
the city actually approached us .
and again , going on thinking about this , i realize that in a way we &apos;re all victims of a certain kind of tyranny of the triumph of modernism whereby form and function in an object have to follow one another , or are deemed to do so .
( rumbling ) so right here , these are the motor units that are happening from her spinal cord out to her muscle right here , and as she &apos;s doing it , you &apos;re seeing the electrical activity that &apos;s happening here .
one of the great ironies of modern food systems is that they &apos;ve made the very thing they promised to make easier much harder .
so for example , if someone said , &quot; &quot; my likelihood of suffering from cancer is about 50 percent , &quot; &quot; and we said , &quot; &quot; hey , good news .
but one of them carlos ghosn , ceo of renault and nissan , when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating .
the rest , almost 500,000 people , are dying outside of conflict zones .
you can give yourself your morning pleasures in various languages .

&#91; the &#93; tasmanian devil is found only on the island of tasmania , which is that small island just to the south of the mainland of australia .
and so i wonder if we should just take a leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things .
the challenge here , though , is that the popular men and women are sticking to 97 words on average that are written very , very well , even though it may not seem like it all the time .
the evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species , at particular times of the year .
let me show you some examples .
but , using the language of galois , we can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things are actually the same .
so i don &apos;t know what the balance is , but i think sharks have more right to be fearful of us than we have of them .
i think in some ways , the reason i started the project , even though i didn &apos;t know it at the time , was because i was struggling with my own secrets .
but what does it mean ? how does it impact on our everyday life ?
i mean , in that circumstance , couldn &apos;t you argue that what he did was reasonable ?
you have to be willing to take those risks .
and then we divide it , and this one big piece of dough is divided into smaller units , and each of those units are given shape by the baker .
but the real issue is there &apos;s no food at home .
i didn &apos;t know ted then , but what i did was i closed my eyes tight , and i started dreaming . i could imagine people coming in , dressed up , looking beautiful , my paintings with all the light , and in my visualization i actually saw a very famous actress launching my show , giving credibility to me .
that &apos;s why , when we launched photos on twitter , we made the decision to strip that geodata out .
well , you have to let me say this .
it is , as steven johnson has talked about , an emergent phenomenon .
but i don &apos;t always know the degree to which a changing context ...
if that is true , it leads to some very complicated questions for the london olympics .
it is a structure for maintain , for centuries , by generations , without any department , without any funding , so the secret is &quot; &quot; &#91; unclear &#93; , &quot; &quot; respect .
you can see the united states ahead of everyone else , and much of the economic success of the united states draws on its long-standing advantage as the first mover in education .
so for example , if your date is smiling at you , this technology can help you to determine whether she actually likes you or she is just trying to be nice to you .
imagine being able to — and , again , it &apos;s a templated process , and it solidifies out of a liquid process — imagine being able to have that sort of structure coming out at room temperature .
where do we come up with these ideas ?
twenty-three years ago , at the age of 19 , i shot and killed a man .
so it &apos;s common — don &apos;t expect to be out of here in 10 minutes .
so presently , we are doing the following : first of all , we are decomposing the k-12 math curriculum into numerous such apps .
therefore , ending poverty is simply a matter of delivering proven goods and services to people .
it &apos;s structured , so it ends up being simple to remember , and it &apos;s okay to break it here and there .
they live in groups with a very strict social hierarchy .
we &apos;re born to make a difference .
first rule : there is no clan distinguished and political division in somali society .
what do i mean by these two different forces ?
they bring the medicines up from the pharmacy .
she &apos;s trying to force-feed my camera , which is every photographer &apos;s dream .
saparmurat niyazov , he was one of them .
he &apos;d been expecting me . mohamed had phoned .
but we should be getting out there ourselves and not depending on large institutions to do it for us .
this is the lowland tapir , the tapir species i work with , the largest terrestrial mammal of south america .
and finally , point number three : whatever one wants to say about lesterland , against the background of its history , its traditions , in our land , in usa-land , lesterland is a corruption , a corruption .
it turned out , as i think you could see in aimee &apos;s capabilities and attitudes , people with a desire to do something are quite remarkable and nature is quite adaptable .
i used the three bs of stand-up don &apos;ts as i call them in the middle east : blue content , keep it clean ; beliefs , not religion ; and the third b , bolitics .
so what they did is they — i mean , they put csi to shame here — the internet detectives came out .
( video ) ( laughs ) you are peaceful people .
so the challenge was — i worked for microsoft for a little bit , working on the microsoft barney .
but no , i wasn &apos;t born there .
on the other hand , i didn &apos;t know anything about this . ok ?
and i know how we got here .
and as a result of this program , something &apos;s happening for conservation .
you turn up the dials , the wheel starts to turn .
come the one year anniversary of my journey , i went to see my surgeon , dr. john healey — and by the way , healey , great name for a doctor .
and maybe if we all tried to read our fears , we too would be less often swayed by the most salacious among them .
when we think about working memory , we have to realize that this limited capacity has lots of different impacts on us .
this is why we decided to take the operation undercover when necessary , and use mostly hidden cameras .
was the internet actually a place that you could visit ?
it &apos;s called hutchinson-gilford progeria , and it is the most dramatic form of premature aging .
and when we solve real problems for people , we solve them for the rest of the world at the same time .
am i out of time ? ok .
and when i began looking into these cases , i was wondering , where do these bizarre memories come from ?
that the reason that you want to be below two watts is that &apos;s roughly what you can generate with your upper body .
if your bank account &apos;s one dollar , and you flip a single bit , you could end up with a thousand dollars .
we really have no idea .
i was so determined to be a teacher now so that i could make a difference in my family .
and we can use that same pulse , now applied to the rtpj , to ask if we can change people &apos;s moral judgments .
we , as i &apos;ve said , have got to hit that market , but we &apos;ve got to use our heads rather than our might .
you do some routine refresher training , and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you .
they want to get out .
i was on bowman lake in glacier national park , which is a long , skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it , and my partner and i have a rowing shell .
and we owe a tremendous credit to that .
when they were sick , we would collect specimens from them .
video : now she comes up to dr. sue and starts writing again .
we have a process where we , you know , kind of put it into the computer and digitize it , and then a whole lot of analysis .
of course , the accuracy keeps getting worse .
resurrection is possible .
so they &apos;re all well documented deviations from rational behavior .
i was going to say , i had a great social experience when i went to college that i hadn &apos;t had before , a more fraternal experience , where i met six or seven other guys who i studied physics with , and i was very competitive with them , so then i started to get a &apos;s . but you &apos;re right : i wasn &apos;t an a student .
he realized at once what had happened .
so we were looking at how we could make a power station , that , instead of keeping people out and having a big fence around the outside , could be a place that pulls you in .
so what we have to do , i think , is invent a new kind of agriculture that blends the best ideas of commercial agriculture and the green revolution with the best ideas of organic farming and local food and the best ideas of environmental conservation , not to have them fighting each other but to have them collaborating together to form a new kind of agriculture , something i call &quot; &quot; terraculture , &quot; &quot; or farming for a whole planet .
and those three verses are the core of authenticity .
the battery is not the gas tank , in a sense .
this baby is a human body : it evolved .
one of the reasons is a lot of their telephones use ip protocol and use things like skype and so on that go through the internet right now , and so in fact we &apos;re becoming dependent on it for more and more different things , like when you take off from lax , you &apos;re really not thinking you &apos;re using the internet .
it was that the nobel prize was the tombstone on all great work , and it resonated because i had won 35 out of 36 contests that i &apos;d entered over 11 years , and it made me bananas .
but five years ago , i went on a personal journey .
&quot; &quot; you &apos;ve never really been sure of this , but i can assure you that this quirk you &apos;re so self-conscious of is intensely endearing .
but that is clearly insufficient to address the needs of the people and address the needs of the countries that are supporting the people .
now , pay transparency takes a lot of forms .
and we also have some terrific women who are writing new stories for our kids , and as three-dimensional and delightful as hermione and katniss are , these are still war movies .
this is not about money .
but if you grow up in an area like this , you see affirmative action as a tool to hold people like you back .
so during the chicago mayoral election there was a parody account .
some of you would eat it only if it &apos;s a strangely colored piece of tofu .
if they &apos;re talking about having lost a family member , don &apos;t start talking about the time you lost a family member .
it &apos;s great to be a kid .
so by trying to preserve our dead bodies , we deny death , poison the living and further harm the environment .
audience : now . daniel kish : good . excellent .
and so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open .
it is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult , expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks , and doing that with a local resource , plenty available .
so , we study the holistic health experience of 1,000 seniors over the last 10 years in 20 different countries .
and we call that the meme-ome .
we organized into cities . we had many people .
i can &apos;t feel the wind here , but i just asked one of the caretakers who passed by what it felt like , and she said it felt warm , like melted butter .
( applause )
so production and comprehension rely on very similar processes .
so each chain , or each element , wants to turn right or left .
long steps . so a lot of milongueros — the tango dancers will use very short steps .
to illustrate these mindsets in action , i &apos;m going to take you back to 19th-century france , where this innocuous-looking piece of paper launched one of the biggest political scandals in history .
one way of asking them the question is like this : &quot; &quot; others in similar circumstances have thought about ending their life ; have you had these thoughts ? &quot; &quot; confronting the person head-on may just save their life and be the turning point for them .
so there can be some biologists , psychiatrists , mathematicians , and so on .
this is what the code on your phone looks like , but this is what the code on your computer looks like .
and i lied .
only 18 percent of italians and 15 percent of greeks believe that their vote matters .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard about it — newspapers ?
not just in the streets , but in their homes , at school and at work .
to whom do you speak at least once a week , be it face to face or on facetime ?
i thought that was a pretty big deal .
but the people of the middle east have been deprived of any form of what we know as civic education .
one area is called experimental economics . the other area is called behavioral economics .
and we need preparedness .
and the chinese character for crisis is actually the same side of the same coin .
it is a struggle to try and live a life that is set by the moral codes written in the koran .
i &apos;m not alone , and i am loved .
there is no area of the government — not the epa or the fda — that controls genetically-engineered pets .
and you might be thinking that it was good luck , but it wasn &apos;t .
thank you very much .
that &apos;s it . the task is finished . &quot; &quot; so , now we had a student — an acting student — that was a part of the group .
we want every girl to experience the dance , right ? &quot; &quot; so the girls thought for a moment , and one girl suggested , &quot; why don &apos;t we just take the dance in the jail ? &quot;
we stand today on the threshold of the post-antibiotic era , in the earliest days of a time when simple infections such as the one joe had will kill people once again .
they came up with the very same rules that we had , except they &apos;re theirs .
let me talk about something a little technical for a moment here .
but i don &apos;t want to take responsibility of your emotional baggage .
there was not a flashlight , not a lantern , not a candle — pitch black .
we can tell in the operating room , in the field , at a molecular level , where is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do and how much more work they need to do to cut that out .
what would it look like if there was an easy pathway for the very entrepreneurs and innovators who have disrupted our tech sector to come and disrupt their government ?
when you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms , at first it &apos;s very bizarre .
if you are surrounding yourself with the right people , they will not only get it , they will appreciate it .
but getting this out is one of the things we want to do .
in fact , the winners have to pay their own way to come to the ig nobel ceremony , which most of them do .
that &apos;s where she has to pull herself out from the depths of mortality , come in , release her spirit .
with the patient insensitive to pain , and a sterile operating field all bets were off , the sky was the limit .
of more concern , i think , is the asteroids that exist between mars and jupiter .
first , we need strong health systems in poor countries .
you know , you have new diseases that require new drugs .
we &apos;ve got to start thinking about asking people to retire a little bit later .
is there a way to know ?
( laughter ) ( video ) : ninety .
it was an act of kindness .
i had fun again , i worked harder and , to cut a long story short , did all the things that took me back up to success .
i imagine a whole world of surrogate donors from all walks of life , different sizes , different ages , coming together in this voice drive to give people voices that are as colorful as their personalities .
so , we &apos;ve become one of the hot , young jazz recording studios in the united states of america ( laughter ) in the middle of the inner city with a high crime rate .
listen to this : less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treated stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment .
but i think it &apos;s insane to believe that we will ever make a society that is genuinely meritocratic ; it &apos;s an impossible dream .
i want to quote this guy — the guy in robes , not the other guy — the dalai lama , who said , &quot; &quot; if you want others to be happy , practice compassion .
and this material that &apos;s deposited either starts as a liquid form or a material powder form .
but look what happened in europe after the plague : rising wages , land reform , technological innovation , birth of the middle class ; and after that , forward-looking social movements like the renaissance , and later the enlightenment .
or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere .
look what happened by 2000 to the average call .
and they actually lived another 14 days , or 28 when we finally killed them , and took them apart and figured out what went wrong .
this proved that anonymous and this idea can rally the masses from the keyboards to the streets , and it laid the foundations for dozens of future operations against perceived injustices to their online and offline world .
not so much different from us , they can use plants to treat their intestinal parasites .
evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment .
just think of people at a checkout line or at a red light .
and so the citizen scientists , when they saw this , they notified the science team that they found something weird enough that it might be worth following up .
it turns out that women are really driving the social media revolution .
that would be very boring .
in fact , i am a data nerd .
one of the key qualities of all stories is that they &apos;re made to be shared .

in fact — ( applause ) thank you .
and you know what my response to all of that is ?
( laughter ) it &apos;s all i got . ( laughs ) so , in this suburb , the poo and the pee and the wash water are going to this treatment plant right in the middle of the community .
under normal sentencing procedures , judge russell would have had little choice but to sentence pettengill to serious jail-time as a drug felon .

( laughter ) summer vacations often consisted of my father trying to heal me , so i drank deer &apos;s milk , i had hot cups on my back , i was dunked in the dead sea , and i remember the water burning my eyes and thinking , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s working ! it &apos;s working ! &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) but one miracle cure we did find was yoga .
let &apos;s hear what jeff han has to say about this newfangled technology .
and then finally , there &apos;s how the system can handle uncertainty .
the effect of this has been that , within the first year , we really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served , which is over 50,000 people .
mcintyre wrote about this and it was read by the editor of high times magazine .
they were screaming .
now , when john f. kennedy sent a man to the moon and decided to bring him back , or decided to do both those things , he didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; hey , whenever you guys get to it . &quot; &quot; he gave us a deadline .
time for development — it took around 10 years and 700 million dollars .
i think all schools could use extra equipment , extra cash — it &apos;s going to be an incentive for them to do that .
perhaps even worse is when it finds its way into our oceans , like in the great plastic gyre , where these materials are being mechanically broken into smaller and smaller bits , but they &apos;re not really going away .
that &apos;s quite a lot .
our instinct as parents is to order our kids around .
as a little girl , i always imagined i would one day run away .
it just came on the scene three years ago .
why do we dance together ?
and the great thing is there &apos;s no trick like with the glass ceiling .
in fact , no , education spending should not be cut .
so one approach we ’ re taking is to try to design drugs that function like molecular scotch tape , to hold the protein into its proper shape .
what rises twice a year , once in easter and then two weeks before christmas , has a mini peak every monday , and then flattens out over the summer ?
maybe it &apos;s going to rain .
i mean , we want to build frameworks in a way that makes it acceptable and makes it productive down the road .
and this is a little bit freaky , because what motts is seeing is actually this .
in theory , this means we could restore hundreds of native species that have been pushed to the brink .
i signed up for something called the personal genome project .
you want button fly or zipper fly ? you want stonewashed or acid-washed ?
we developed a theory called &quot; &quot; dragon-kings . &quot; &quot; dragon-kings represent extreme events which are of a class of their own .
reclaiming yourself can be one of the most gorgeous acts of self-love and can look like a million different things , from hairstyles to tattoos to body contouring to hormones to surgery and yes , even weight loss .
karl marx saw this as the tragedy of capitalism , the alienation of the worker from the product of his labor .
and i &apos;m not suggesting that we do , but the bottom line is , we &apos;ve always had alternatives .
and that needs to be recognized , first of all , that peacekeeping works .
for example , the incarceration rate , the prison population in this country has quadrupled since 1980 .
you &apos;re not supposed to rip off the shark or the monster .
check ignition and may god &apos;s love be with you .

he said , &quot; &quot; i am a scrap of a man , but if you help me , i &apos;m ready to do anything , even if i have to crawl on the ground . &quot; &quot; and then he sat down .
i &apos;m thrilled to be here .
so half the earth &apos;s internet population is using facebook .
if you &apos;re going to look for where the change is happening , you have to look on the margins .
and we &apos;ve studied this on a whole slew of different political issues .
they are expecting to create little , tiny black holes .

i &apos;m a global citizen .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super sex . &quot;
thanks so much , chris . cu : thank you . ( applause )
( laughter ) eh : i want to talk about your work .
or maybe your brother-in-law who doesn &apos;t believe in global warming .
and i &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; didn &apos;t we just go through this last year ? &quot; &quot; but i &apos;m going to pick the one that interests me most , and that is the completed marriage of the cell phone and the internet .
it &apos;s things like androstenol , androstenone or androstadienone .
we tell them we &apos;ll see them in 18 years , and getting there is kind of on them .
so that &apos;s a ship .
i washed my face with this this morning in preparation for this .
the anger in me against corruption made me to make a big career change last year , becoming a full-time practicing lawyer .
further advances came when the team removed the restriction enzyme genes from the recipient capricolum cell .
ca : and so , and that windmill , what — it worked ?
dendritic cells , or macrophages , capture the virus and display pieces of it .
and secondly , where did the leprosy bacteria come from ?
and every culture comes up with its own understanding of life , its own customized version of mythology .
the doorbell rang and it was a trick-or-treater dressed as my character . it was so cool .
and because the probability of me throwing it just right is very low , given everybody watching me , what we &apos;re going to do instead is show you a video that we shot last night .
chaz ebert : it was chaz who stood by my side through three attempts to reconstruct my jaw and restore my ability to speak .
cryptocurrencies can be used for illegal transactions , just like cash is used for crime in the world today .
okay , now the question is really , why is this so ?
we also talked about the white shark cafe .
so those folks in new mexico — why did they do it ?
and to tell you a bit about the things that i make , the easiest place to start the story is with a hat .
in the case of the indus script , the problem is the reverse .
but that &apos;s not right .
and really , this is the reason i came here tonight .
so this should really be seen at home with you typing in your own address , but i &apos;m going to give you a little preview of what you can expect .
and for me , the sound of a steel guitar , because one of my parents &apos; neighbors just gave me one of these things .
there are over 500,000 local and state offices in america .
if there is only one machine , and our little handhelds and devices are actually just little windows into those machines , but that we &apos;re basically constructing a single , global machine .
president obama has got the red carpet , he goes down air force one , and it feels pretty good , it feels pretty comfortable .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
it &apos;s essentially like he &apos;s extending his skin up there , far away .
ok . now , children get their ideas not from teachers , as teachers often think , but actually from common sense , from experience of the world around them , from all the things that go on between them and their peers , and their carers , and their parents , and all of that . experience .
this is where we stand today .
none of these techniques result in any amount of recycling in any significant way .
we live in the post-sampling era .
and drew barrymore , for all her wonderful charm , is not glamorous either .
we brought it into the rover , we tasted it , and guess what ?
we &apos;re at last starting to debate this issue , and the benefits that are available for designing for the ears in education , unbelievable .
these pictures mean more to me than you know .
but the human brain — ( laughter ) the human brain always triumphs , and indeed , in the united states today , 86 percent of americans will marry by age 49 .
and we as citizens , as we go through this experience of the kind of , the crisis of confidence , crisis of competence , crisis of legitimacy , i think there &apos;s a temptation to pull back from the world and say , ah , katrina , iraq — we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re doing .
and it &apos;s not a special effects film ; it has to be a man .
now it &apos;s 11 : 00 pm in rio .
but if you take that logic , you know , you should consider life unfair , because the test of truth in life is not whether we can remember what we learned in school , but whether we are prepared for change , whether we are prepared for jobs that haven &apos;t been created , to use technologies that haven &apos;t been invented , to solve problems we just can &apos;t anticipate today .
as many of you are aware , the world of academia is a rather inward-looking one .
how the heck could they be &#91; a &#93; developing country ?

when i entered prison , i was bitter , i was angry , i was hurt .
try and build a political settlement first .
and you see this teenager running down a street , and then you see google street view and google maps imagery and you realize the street he &apos;s running down is yours .
moreover , today , more than half of the world &apos;s population live in cities .
and my grandchildren and everyone else will .
if you climb these three , six steps you will find something very nice .
the canneries are gone . the pollution has abated .
neither can attack the other , because to attack the other side you &apos;ve got to come down the mountain into the valley and then up the other side , and you &apos;re completely exposed .
so we have created a very disruptive structure which mimics the design of bone , or a skeleton , which occurs in nature .
much of the road congestion in and out of our cities will disappear .
on up to iceland .
i don ’ t know of any other submersible , or even remote , that just takes advantage that this is a three-dimensional space .
here on the model you see the predator attacking .
i &apos;m talking about losing it in the same way that we lost the dinosaurs : actually losing it , never to be seen again .
here &apos;s what most of the sand in our world looks like .
bassem was a good swimmer , so he held her hand and tread water .
i came mainly to be reunited with my family and to reconnect in a way that i found my place in the society .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
so was mars habitable ?
and he went back to them , and they agreed to do another 10 .
it &apos;s not because she is stupid or he is stupid .
it &apos;s especially important now .
i &apos;m going to argue tonight that compassion and the golden rule are , in a certain sense , built into human nature .
this is a measurement we obtained a few years ago from a mars-orbiting satellite called odyssey .
for anyone here from brazil , you &apos;ll know about this plant .
the publication of those images , as opposed to the images themselves , caused a government to change its policies .
we see it as terrorism versus democracy in that brand war .
this is a bit shocking , because in fact our government is relying on that for us to meet kyoto , and do all those kind of things .
and i use that sort of technology to create things that are quite beautiful .
our credit scores have helped us deliver over 200,000 loans in kenya in just the past year .
but there are more important things that are already occurring : embryo screening .
let &apos;s talk about dna analysis in space .
we &apos;ve used it to bring people face to face and connect them with each other , building real relationships and supporting people to find work .
and i &apos;ve done this in three parts .
the years went by and the princess grew up into a beautiful young woman , who whistled even more beautifully . ( whistling )
what ought we to be studying ?
worldwide , over 1.5 billion people experience armed conflict .
abed said that i should call back in a few weeks , and when i did , and a recording told me that his number was disconnected , i let abed and the crash go .
everything that is allowed , every configuration that is allowed to be obtained by the molecules in this room , would eventually be obtained .
and then the process on shore takes around three or four days , and then , when it &apos;s done , they put the manhole cover back on top , and they push the sand over that , and we all forget about it .
we like our suffering because it &apos;s so good when it ceases for a while . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) this is what i see from the balcony of my hermitage in the himalayas .
while we humans , we are happy in our comfort zone , these plants also need their ecosystem to be preserved , and they don &apos;t react — endemic plants don &apos;t react to very harsh changes in their ecosystem , and yet we know what are the challenges that climate change , for example , is posing to these plants .
my funeral home sells a few caskets made out of things like woven willow and bamboo , but honestly , most of our families just choose a simple shroud .
165 .
now hold your breath , not too long , to imagine what comes next .
i &apos;d say , watch any successful well-written , family-friendly sitcom in the west for your answers .
that &apos;s actually not so bad . if you go back to the carter and even reagan administrations , they were rating the other party 43 , 45 . it &apos;s not terrible .
getting the cause and the effect right makes all the difference in the world .
( applause )
and what we &apos;re doing with them is taking a traditional race-car chassis and giving it a nervous system .
what &apos;s your hope / depression level on this ?
we need to get away from feeling , in the same way , human rights matters because of the other things it brings , or women &apos;s rights matters for the other things it brings .
and i started to fall .
and you &apos;re kind of trapped in the texture of kymaerica .
as a result , they can &apos;t improve on others &apos; ideas or learn from others &apos; mistakes — benefit from others &apos; wisdom .
truly extraordinary altruists &apos; compassion extends way beyond that circle , even beyond their wider circle of acquaintances to people who are outside their social circle altogether , total strangers , just like the man who rescued me .
we have .
there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors . thanks .
and i think we can go and use our technology to go and digitize things , put them on the net , and then download , print them and bind them , and end up with books again .
any event that happens anywhere in the world , i should be able to know about it pretty much instantaneously , as it happens , for free .
and how much will they pay for this ?
and it &apos;s not based on theology or philosophy , it &apos;s in the study of the mind , across all these spheres of research , from neuroscience to the cognitive scientists , behavioral economists , psychologists , sociology , we &apos;re developing a revolution in consciousness .
all right ? anybody else like that , no ?
that &apos;s it , thank you .
100 years later .
i can &apos;t tell you when this will start , because i don &apos;t want my competition to know my schedule .
so the oyster was the basis for a manifesto-like urban design project that i did about the new york harbor called &quot; &quot; oyster-tecture . &quot; &quot; and the core idea of oyster-tecture is to harness the biological power of mussels , eelgrass and oysters — species that live in the harbor — and , at the same time , harness the power of people who live in the community towards making change now .
like one of the ways to understand our greenhouse future is to drill down in time to the last period where we had co2 double what it is today .
he &apos;s not quite a child , and he &apos;s not quite a man .
that &apos;s a very powerful idea , and it &apos;s a very powerful reality .
so i just lifted my face up from the manuscript and i directed my comments to an empty corner of the room .
i didn &apos;t know what was the war for .
good news : chariot &apos;s coming . good news : chariot &apos;s coming .
and after a few years , you can remove some of those shade trees .
embarrassed , the animals fled , and that was the last time they revealed themselves this way .
and if you were going to fight orcs on the fields of mordor against the ra &apos;s al ghul , you &apos;d probably want to be the bigger one , right ?
but along with the scientific challenge and the economic challenge , there &apos;s also a cultural challenge , and this is probably the part about malaria that people don &apos;t like to talk about .
so what is happening ?
right around d-day , bonica showed up to madigan army medical center , near tacoma .
here &apos;s the mystery , then : how do we actually make these polymer chains inside the brain so we can move all the biomolecules apart ?
now it &apos;s a little bit of a surprise that to get an answer to that question , we have to go to tool use in the chimpanzees .
we said : if we take the top hundred companies , what percentage of all 15 commodities do they touch , buy or sell ?
preach technology to all the twittering members of all the iranian demonstrations who are now in political prison in tehran , where ahmadinejad remains in power .
what is raveling ? you see that in this road that the stones at the surface come off .
you can see on the pottery and the baskets .
we didn &apos;t — a lot of flying , a lot of experiments , a lot of things that didn &apos;t work , and ones that did work , and the plane kept getting a little better , a little better .
and i love my country , and i &apos;m not going to fail that . i &apos;m not going to fail that .
so let me just end with a couple of scenarios .
it &apos;s a start .
whoosh . okay .
here &apos;s koko with her kitten .
i want to stress , you know , social organization can transcend political bounds .
that &apos;s what we do .
some of it is controlled , like music or theater , but most of it is chaotic and incoherent , which some of us refer to as noise .
you don &apos;t learn how to hold two things just from the fluff , you learn it from the grit .
it &apos;s a death sentence .
all they had was mike &apos;s hard lemonade , which was five percent alcohol .
the human brain also seems special in the amount of energy that it uses .
the brain is a bit of a hog when it comes to using glucose .
familiarity destroys and trumps fear . try it .
dj : so at this stage , i guess , we had very , very firm ideas on what conservation meant .
but we only looked at a handful of individuals at this point .
( applause )
we need to somehow get their message to the policymakers .
we ride the elevator up and we crawl in , on your hands and knees into the spaceship , one at a time , and you worm your way up into your chair and plunk yourself down on your back .
he was wrong .
and third , it had to be what amitabha calls infinitely expandable .
or worse , about to sue them . and so i went through — ( laughter ) right ? i went through my entire business career , and never spoke about being a woman , never spoke about it publicly .
but as early as 1968 , this visionary man , robert kennedy , at the start of his ill-fated presidential campaign , gave the most eloquent deconstruction of gross national product that ever has been .
it &apos;s also the great theoretical triumph of biology .
but this time , i was the patient .
and this work corrects that bias in our culture , that dehumanizing bias .
a single cave system , like mammoth cave , which is in kentucky , can be as long as more than 600 kilometers .
mahmood ali balogun : i think filmmaking in nigeria , for those who work in it , is a kind of subsistence filmmaking — what they do to make a living .
♪ sending out an s.o.s. ♪ come on now .
jp : no not at all . i &apos;m having a great day with the kids .
they asked the fbi to go to congress and make the case .
almost anybody who &apos;s looked at well-run organizations has come to pretty much the same conclusion .
the unforgivable shit i would do to her . &quot; &quot; online misogyny is a global gender rights tragedy , and it is imperative that it ends .
for the hundred or so countries that are ranked below china , more than half of them are electoral democracies .
i didn &apos;t know who she was , and she said , &quot; &quot; did you get george abbott to talk ? &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; yeah . apparently i did . &quot; &quot; and she said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m his old girlfriend , maureen stapleton , and i could never do it . &quot; &quot; and then she made me go up with the tape of it and prove that george abbott actually could talk .
he wrote that , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radical acts like the brain of one of the lower animals . &quot; &quot; this is not a metaphor .
face 2 face demonstrated that what we thought impossible was possible — and , you know what , even easy .
on october 7 , he calls his cousin in belgium , and explains his situation .
so what does it mean to design at a global scale ?
what i &apos;m going to do is look at five categories of experiments , each of which challenges an old assumption of philanthropy .
and she doesn &apos;t know when it &apos;s going to be available again .
modeling , they tried modeling all the time . they were always modeling things .
do you hear me ? do you hear me ?
so nice , all week . he &apos;s the kind of man you could say to , &quot; &quot; chris , i &apos;m really sorry , i &apos;ve crashed your car .
so , an interpreter of what ? of a piece of music , right ?
we look in cortical areas that control specific movements , and the sequences of movements that are required in the behavior , and so forth .
how do you know ?
i was surrounded by extraordinary women in my life : grandmothers , teachers , aunts , cousins , neighbors , who taught me about quiet strength and dignity .
we were totally dependent during those years on this amazing acronym , which is mad .
the rest of you , you will grow older and you will get two billion children .
they &apos;ve funded research that shows that we can double global palm oil production without cutting a single tree in the next 20 years , and do it all in borneo alone by planting on land that &apos;s already degraded .
we can track these changes , and have tracked these changes in many such behaviors across time .
so , clearly , we were in a substantially better place for this .
they &apos;re probably going to be angry , depressed , frustrated .
and one of the things i really like about gardening is that it doesn &apos;t take all your concentration , you really can &apos;t get hurt — it &apos;s not like woodworking — and you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation .
and here &apos;s what i found : most people are worrying about the wrong thing .
so let me just explain to you that the smartest man ever was a scotsman .
dysmorphophobia is a perversion of this where people who may be very good looking regard themselves as hideously ugly and are constantly seeking surgery to correct their facial appearance .
this is the first experiment that we did — eight year-old boy on your right teaching his student , a six year-old girl , and he was teaching her how to browse .
i &apos;ve heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet is the adolescent male .
so the next time you find yourself in a pitch-black closet clutching your grenade , know we have all been there before .
the color represents different rooms they are in the house .
so it turns out the two species were interdependent , like yin and yang .
sometimes i get little old ladies from the seventh day adventist church showing me these cartoon pictures of heaven .
that &apos;s the place to be .
i &apos;m going to talk to you now about the elephant rather than the camel in the room .
yeah , so seeds that could save your life . you know ?
i &apos;m watching who &apos;s watching me .
you know , the spanish didn &apos;t sink the battleship maine , the lusitania was not an innocent vessel but was loaded with munitions , the north vietnamese did not attack the seventh fleet , and , of course , saddam hussein hated al qaeda and had nothing to do with it , and yet the administration convinced 45 percent of the people that they were brothers in arms , when he would hang one from the nearest lamppost .
and when i came back , i had to give them a lot of gratitude and praise because they showed me that they truly had my back and that they truly had their own backs .
it &apos;s like the old maxim of &quot; &quot; you can tell somebody something and show them , but if they do it they really learn it . &quot; &quot; here is another thing you can do .
we had heard this story about lost gold from a gold rush-era robbery , and we wanted to go up there .
now i &apos;m going to close with a video that is kind of unusual .
her spanish was great because she was from mexico .
so , you can kind of get an idea from this extrapolating that back under this huge picture , so we get this idea of what the primal universe looked like .
for decades , workers with a high school degree have been denied a fair share of what they have produced .
if you have any videos of yourself , three or four years ago , you probably feel embarrassed because you don &apos;t recognize yourself .
hyperbolic overkill is a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit , just for the fun of it . this was a piece i did — a brochure again — &quot; rms tyrannic : the biggest thing in all the world . &quot;
we could test the safety of chemicals that we are exposed to on a daily basis in our environment , such as chemicals in regular household cleaners .
the first thought is that , hey , you know there &apos;s somebody somewhere out there playing some music , and this is a small but i think important human connection to make that perhaps the technology affords .
would you describe that as global citizenship ?
taiwan succeeded , china under mao zedong didn &apos;t .
here are three sets of firing patterns . the top one is from a normal animal , the middle one is from a blind animal that &apos;s been treated with this encoder-transducer device , and the bottom one is from a blind animal treated with a standard prosthetic .
here &apos;s another one : &quot; &quot; sorry i didn &apos;t respond to you earlier .
and so i asked jawad , &quot; &quot; how do you guys navigate ? this is a really diverse community .
is this just an interesting mathematical structure that might be able to explain some previously unexplained features of the world , or can we actually test for these extra dimensions ?
or languages have different word orders .
what did we want from each other ?
and if you reach back into the dark corners of your memory , you might remember something like what i felt when my grandfather died and when i realized it could happen to me too , that sense that behind all of this the void is waiting .
( applause )
they held my mouth and dragged me out of the stadium , where they thoroughly beat me up and locked me up in jail .
and for those of you that don &apos;t have that authority : it &apos;s time to stand up for your right to .
i &apos;ve lost all faith in the media — a hapless joke i would much rather laugh at than become a part of .
the problem is that we have these color-tinted glasses as we look at all kinds of situations .
thank you .
and as adults , we &apos;re certainly not alone .
i believe at this time we need a moratorium .
again , it &apos;s perfectly safe for people . it puts out the fires , doesn &apos;t hurt anything .
if not , well , this is the hardest problem perhaps in science and philosophy .
it listens to the lecture , and then it uses the amplitude of each word to move a point on the x-axis , and it uses the inflection of sentences to move a same point up and down on the y-axis .
transistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen , and technology has really benefitted from that .
if you want to change the world , you have to group together , you have to be collaborative .
you &apos;ll see that this is exactly the same condition , only in the no-director condition they just have to remember to apply this somewhat arbitrary rule , whereas in the director condition , they have to remember to take into account the director &apos;s perspective in order to guide their ongoing behavior .
this is why politics is so tribal .
we &apos;re going to need individuals of all ages , from the young to the old , and with all different shapes and sizes of the autism spectrum disorder to make sure that we can have an impact .
one is a little larger , it maybe also has a few tricks in the exact way it &apos;s wired .
he created this experiment that is used in many other experiments in behavioral science .
but under the surface was a very different reality .
it turns out , miguel spent the better part of his career in the mikumi national park in africa .
they don &apos;t shy away from infrastructure .
it &apos;s in spite of doctors , not because of doctors .
now , unfortunately , there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly .
so governments from russia to china to iran are actually hiring , training and paying bloggers in order to leave ideological comments and create a lot of ideological blog posts to comment on sensitive political issues . right ?
they believe juniper smoke is holy .
they rock the mic outside my window every morning .

but i got a phone call from bono in 1985 and , as you know , he &apos;s a great singer , but he &apos;s a magnificent hustler , and — ( laughter ) — a very hard guy to say no to , and he was saying , you know , just after i &apos;d done the biko song , we &apos;re going to do a tour for amnesty , you have to be on it , and really that was the first time that i &apos;d been out and started meeting people who &apos;d watched their family being shot in front of them , who &apos;d had a partner thrown out of an airplane into an ocean , and suddenly this world of human rights arrived in my world ,
we pay for it in our taxes on april 15th .
tracey gamley stepped up to give me the impossible kidney that i was never supposed to have .
down the road , there was another building , a nice visual structure : horizontal , vertical elements , little decorative lines going across , these magenta squiggles , the workmen being reduced to decorative elements , just a nice , kind of , breakup of the urban place .
and when we made a solution of this , tagged with the fluorescence and injected in the body of a mouse , their nerves literally glowed .
so they built the buildings and then they waited a few months for the paths to form .
eventually , hasbro themselves invited me to their headquarters so they could go and unveil their new easy-bake oven product to me in black , silver and blue .
we begin to go on the hill and lobby .
these are called minimization procedures .
third , i work at an enormously supportive workplace at usc law school .
so however we do it ...
we want to be able to build technological artifacts that are maybe good for the world .
but my clearest and sharpest memory of my auntie , is also one of my first memories of life at all .
thank you . ( applause ) ( applause ) thank you very much . ( applause )
and i &apos;ll tell you why we need to change it , but we absolutely have to change it .
let &apos;s go back to that time , to this city .
ur : i &apos;d never learned it before , but he told me that we would be playing that on stage , so i was familiar with it , so that &apos;s why i had so much more fun learning it .
now you might recognize this one .
a little rarer are the fallstreak holes . all right ?
julian treasure : i call this the mixer .
bg : now what about the money ?
certainly not good for the police department .
as : so how do you make a selfish character likable ?
in every case , they got the weapons before they got the nuclear power .
of diamonds , correct ? ( audience : no . ) lg : yes ?
it was then that abed resumed at once the tale of woe he had begun over the phone 16 years before .
how did we get so information poor and how can we do better ?
so i decided to start a lawsuit against them , because i wanted to have this information .
and we have the elves in the form of china .
poster for atlantic center for the arts , a school in florida .
the teachers always say , well , it &apos;s fine , but it &apos;s too expensive for what it does .
find an artist or a writer — or , heaven forbid , find a philosopher and talk to them .
( applause ) let &apos;s talk about film now .
so , 16 inmates and 18 girls were invited .
here &apos;s just a symbolic picture of that .
they &apos;re busting through obstacles .
jk : we still had this idea of the hill , though .
so , if we want to track something that was spreading through a network , what we ideally would like to do is to set up sensors on the central individuals within the network , including node a , monitor those people that are right there in the middle of the network , and somehow get an early detection of whatever it is that is spreading through the network .
when my schedule ends , mira briefly shows me how i progressed throughout my session .
their acuity — our acuity is 20 / 20 ; babies &apos; acuity is like 20 / 800 , so they are looking at the world in a very , very blurry fashion .
we all internalize it from a very early age without even having a language for what we &apos;re doing .
and it &apos;s not a banal story — after the liberation he continued to make false papers until the &apos; 70s .
i love contemporary art , but i &apos;m often really frustrated with the contemporary art world and the contemporary art scene .
you may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there but you know to demand it .
we &apos;re ready , because today we have the technology to gather and analyze data in ways that would have been unimaginable to kuznets .
the music &apos;s half of me , but the other half — i landed probably the best gig of all .
and it &apos;s serving 52,000 villages , which represent about 80 million people .
the book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape dictionaries come in . and it &apos;s not going to be the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in .
funny , that .
using molecular engineering , we can actually design a superweapon that can travel through the bloodstream .
eventually i decided , if i was going to end up in prison , i &apos;d better end up on the right side of the bars , so i thought i &apos;d check it out , take a tour of the place my dad worked , the mcneil island penitentiary .
but first , i have to explain why they &apos;re important because vaccines , the power of them , is really like a whisper .
what about bigger numbers ?
imagine an immersive system that permits to go and dive and reconstruct the venice of a given year , some experience you could share within a group .
but there was something really exciting , because i could see at a distance the tv channels covering it , and they had these big vans and the teams and the cameras , and i was basically doing the same thing and all i had was a backpack .
i see that you &apos;re clutching a teddy bear , etc . , etc .
you can have an amazing shot of atrocity , but if you can &apos;t verify it , it &apos;s worth nothing .
now , why am i telling you this story at this meeting ?
it &apos;s a little paper chip .
you end up like some kind of rabid windmill .
come with me .
i actually don &apos;t say this in despair .
very simple .
( applause )
and based on this , people have calculated that the number of permutations and combinations of brain activity exceeds the number of elementary particles in the universe .
it gets worse than that — or perhaps better than that .
a few years ago , after finishing my ph.d. in london , i moved to boston .
and i &apos;m also inspired by the actions that i &apos;m seeing older people taking in service of this movement .
we are committed to making sure that all our agricultural raw materials are sourced from sustainable sources , 100-percent sustainable sources .
what i want to do this afternoon is something a little different than what &apos;s scheduled .
so , it makes one wonder , &quot; &quot; why is it there ? &quot; &quot; i mean , why is there that stop sign in each direction ?
the cmus also include some non-muslim prisoners .
like , now you can do whatever you want , like , you gotta get on with that .
and if we can eventually get good solar in space , that also could help .
fourteen americans die each day from asthma , three times what it was in the &apos; 90s , and it &apos;s almost all coming from car exhaust .
but it &apos;s going to work . it &apos;s more effective than just computational aids .
like this pattern of pulses here actually means &quot; &quot; baby &apos;s face , &quot; &quot; and so when the brain gets this pattern of pulses , it knows that what was out there was a baby &apos;s face , and if it got a different pattern it would know that what was out there was , say , a dog , or another pattern would be a house .
so sometimes fear can produce a constructive response .
but also because the content was very close .
this diagram on the right shows a very beautiful compilation of studies suggesting indeed that there is a nonlinear — possibility for a nonlinear transition just in the next few decades .
and what we found — we thought , these are the older people who are going to be really interested in this program .
unlike , say , a traditional maker of shoes or cabinets , the worker in an industrial factory has no control , no pleasure , and no true satisfaction or understanding in her own work .
one of the most dramatic manifestations of these improvements will be moving from population pyramids to what we might term population coffins .
we &apos;re trying to process so much stuff that some people get synesthetic and just have huge pipes that remember everything .
there &apos;s a about a tenfold difference there , log scale up the side .
there &apos;s — no reactor &apos;s been even built to an old design , much less a new one , in the united states for 25 years .
we so rarely note how different it is from moment to moment , with clouds coming and going .
i &apos;ve got a hydro conversion at a watermill that i own .
autonomous robotic weapons concentrate too much power in too few hands , and they would imperil democracy itself .
for instance , i took them skiing in the mid-atlantic range , which is this range of mountains in the middle of the atlantic .
so online dating is the second most popular way that people now meet each other , but as it turns out , algorithms have been around for thousands of years in almost every culture .
but if you look in nature , you see that different kinds of animals can have really different lifespans .
and i think that &apos;s much better , that kind of control would be much better as a drug .
think about that for a minute .
i don &apos;t know if you have this , but in britain we have two major political parties .
all of quality control , which has had a major impact on industrial processing , is underpinned by statistics .
and how would that change the experience for the patient ?
i don &apos;t know for sure that the brits invented this particular view of the world , but i suspect we might have done so : we are right in the middle , and we &apos;ve cut the pacific in half and flung it to the far corners of the world .
and crazy as it may sound , i believe we can revive the joy of voting .
these are different wars , with different religious factions , different political factions , and different socioeconomic problems .
the mushrooms then are harvested , but very importantly , the mycelium has converted the cellulose into fungal sugars .
and that &apos;s why we can tell the emotion of somebody else — because their muscles are acting , subconsciously , except that we &apos;ve evolved to make the facial muscles really rich with emotion .
here &apos;s an example from hong kong , where some kids made a game and then built their own physical interface device and had a light sensor , so the light sensor detects the hole in the board , so as they move the physical saw , the light sensor detects the hole and controls the virtual saw on the screen and saws down the tree .
and luckily for us , we live in a time where we &apos;re incredibly good at capturing information about ourselves .
well , a lot .
what if we created a private sector challenge to the governors ?
so , she &apos;ll make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys , with african material mixed in . very creative designs , has reached a stage where she even had an order from wal-mart .
these are the ayatollahs , mostly based in qom , who have great clout in the religious community , have been quiet on politics and are going to be getting louder , because they see iran going in an unhealthy direction , a direction contrary to what khomeini had in mind .
it can be wonder .
so maybe you get into things like high-powered lasers or tugging using nets or tethers , as crazy as those sound in the short term .
one of the things that defines a tedster is you &apos;ve taken your passion , and you &apos;ve turned it into stewardship .
and if you look at this tree again within the african context , in west africa , it &apos;s known as the palaver tree , because it performs great social functions .
and from these kinds of serial electron microscopy slices , one can start to make reconstructions in 3d of neurons that look like these .
i want you to imagine that the girl is a chip in the huge macrocosm of collective consciousness .
what was interesting is , by videotaping on a bus , they were able to produce exactly what people on their smartphones were typing , and then they had a surprising result , which is that their software had not only done it for their target , but other people who accidentally happened to be in the picture , they were able to produce what those people had been typing , and that was kind of an accidental artifact of what their software was doing .
this is getting ready for the monsoon in bombay , india .
the devil is in me , court .
this is a donated japanese atom incubator that we found in a nicu in kathmandu .
i got a ferocious sore throat two days later .
when does the learning process begin ? does it begin in first grade ?
you hear it all the time .
the mother came to me , knelt down , and said , &quot; &quot; leymah , take my daughter .
what ? did we do this ? really ? does anyone do this ?
now , recently i &apos;ve been told i &apos;ve been taking the high road .
and i said , &quot; &quot; kids , really quickly — i woke up this morning , i decided i wanted to be able to jump over a house — nothing too big , two or three stories — but , if you could think of any animal , any superhero , any cartoon character , anything you can dream up right now , what kind of legs would you build me ? &quot; &quot; and immediately a voice shouted , &quot; &quot; kangaroo ! &quot; &quot; &quot; no , no , no ! should be a frog ! &quot;
and this reminds me of something i understand lord salisbury said to queen victoria over a hundred years ago , when she was pressing him , &quot; &quot; please change . &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; change ?
it was fun . that was pretty much it .
( music ) panbanisha is trying to give nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors .
even worse , what if blaming the obese means we &apos;re blaming the victims ?
but look in the southern hemisphere .
there were enormous differences between kids who resisted and kids who yielded , in many ways .
and hold onto this . good luck to you .
population growth will mainly occur among the poorest people here because they have high child mortality and they have many children per woman .
and if we have b , a , g , f , what do we expect next ?
they , the woodpeckers , typically will peck , they will bang their head on a piece of wood thousands of times every day . every day !
well , anne frank touched millions with her powerful account of the holocaust .
( applause )
and so you can see here , old-fashioned technology of the paintbrush being applied .
and we &apos;re going to read to you . &quot; &quot; a child who has not been read to is in danger when that child gets to school .
how can we apply this knowledge ?
so it &apos;s not just my father that i &apos;ve imitated .
and you describe it , gabby , over and over , as deeper on so many levels . yes ?
she is on the taliban &apos;s hit list .
where is it ? there &apos;s no way — kt : ( beep ) kt : oh , my god !
as you know , when you put oil and water together , they don &apos;t mix , but through self-assembly we can get a nice oil droplet to form , and we can actually use this as a body for our artificial organism or for our protocell , as you will see later .
and the pattern of these interactions determines whether the ant comes back out , and what it does when it comes back out .
i had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak , looking like the michelin man .
we &apos;re moving into this future where the factory is everywhere , and increasingly that means that the design team is everyone .
this work is called xia gang ( &quot; &quot; leaving post &quot; &quot; ) .
i can tell you , even if you have ten ph.ds. , you can never beat bill gates in understanding the computer industry .
they &apos;re smart .
each time you &apos;re closer , it gets bigger , down to very , very small distances .
so it was a moment in time where all of these startups had to sit and think and got really excited about what they could be .
so , stepping down out of the bus , i headed back to the corner to head west en route to a braille training session .
college ended and i returned to jerusalem for a year .
look at zanesville , ohio .
( laughter ) and especially if it &apos;s kind of interesting books that you care about , in languages that you can read .
and yet , we all rejected this project , none of the donors was willing to have their name connected with it , and it was the first project to be implemented .
so we &apos;re asking for human artifice to become a living thing , and we want growth , we want free energy from sunlight and we want an open metabolism for chemicals .
the thing that &apos;s special about it is this modular targeting system .
just as water drops come together to form oceans , i believe that we all must come together when tackling this global problem .
as you remember , cindy gallop said men don &apos;t know the difference between making love and doing porn .
and the chords , it turned out , were capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions .
and the person walks up to me , and says , &quot; &quot; hi , my name is so-and-so .
what &apos;s more important is that they all seem to share the same ability to implement a process that transforms their assistance , transforms the way they practice medicine .
even if we borrow just a fraction of its ability to tolerate radiation , it would be infinitely better than what we already have , which is just the melanin in our skin .
almost all of these are not only small , they are proliferation-proof .
ultimately , there &apos;s a quantum level where we have to delve into this weirdness .
and about four or five months ago , he underwent an experimental procedure .
it &apos;s very easy to adopt .
so we &apos;ve talked a lot about facial appearance .
and when we have overwhelming problems in front of us , we tend to seek simple answers .
you may just be loud or obnoxious , or some other way causing them to have the headache .
this is about 50 million light years away , so one of our neighboring galaxies .
she &apos;s interacting with her kids and her grand kids .
anyone can lead . anyone can follow .
and with biomimicry , if you &apos;ve got an underutilized resource , you don &apos;t think , &quot; &quot; how am i going to dispose of this ? &quot; &quot; you think , &quot; &quot; what can i add to the system to create more value ? &quot; &quot; and it turns out that different things crystallize out at different stages .
in the world of 4shbab , it &apos;s not about bump and grind .
their face doesn &apos;t look like this . when they &apos;re angry , they look ugly , every being , but when they &apos;re happy they look beautiful .
what would happen if you could actually pay twice as much money to cross the bridge , but go through a lane that &apos;s an express lane ?
so newcastle gave me a call . i said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ll do it from delhi . &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; there &apos;s no way you &apos;re going to handle a million pounds-worth of university money sitting in delhi . &quot; &quot; so in 2006 , i bought myself a heavy overcoat and moved to newcastle .
yes , that &apos;s us , with the greatest income inequality and the greatest social problems , according to those metrics .
i was the kind of religious where everyone i know donated 10 percent of everything they earned to the church , including myself .
that takes an enormous amount of faith and dedication .
because we have all those old men that are creating wars in africa . they will die soon .
i know you &apos;ve been given a lot of challenges today , but if you can take this one piece and think about it a little differently , because diversity is magic .
we &apos;re facing this problem .
but for the first time in three decades into this epidemic we have a real chance to come to grips with hiv .
all this stuff that happens around .
there &apos;s important insights just locked away in company data .
now , when we talk about suicide , there is also a medical contribution here , because 90 percent of suicides are related to a mental illness : depression , bipolar disorder , schizophrenia , anorexia , borderline personality . there &apos;s a long list of disorders that contribute , and as i mentioned before , often early in life .
there &apos;s a definition of leadership which says , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s the ability to use the smallest possible crisis for the biggest possible effect . &quot; &quot; and i want to talk about how we ensure that this crisis , which is by no means small , really is used to the full .
now , imagine building that up to a city , or to a society , and you &apos;ve got , obviously , an interesting problem .
in fact , this image also contains the equivalent of this , more specifically , this .
( music ) l.d. was my college romance .
the second thing i learned is that when people like me , who understood that fear , who had learned a new language , who had navigated new systems , when people like us were sitting at the table , we advocated for our communities &apos; needs in a way that no one else could or would .
it was mairead &apos;s sister .
when we saw that , we asked : could the impairment in visual integration be the manifestation of something underneath , of dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism ?
so if you lose that precious resource , where you are somewhat equal to the richer countries , that &apos;s a huge waste .
and the last thing is that — actually , the direction of the conversation .
here for example is a flamenco dancer , except there was one problem .
it will be prohibited because we &apos;ll have to save our natural resources in a few decades from now .
and it was a shocker , because it was everything we wanted those other pictures taken from orbit to be .
and tonight , what i would like to do is speak directly to other plutocrats , to my people , because it feels like it &apos;s time for us all to have a chat .
( applause )
the banks — these banks are now consolidated , and that strengthening of the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside .
i mean , that &apos;s what &apos;s harvest — we say we harvest the pig , you know ?
and so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world , unless you &apos;re a particle physicist .
but again , you can see this , kind of , organic fusion of multiple building elements to make a thing which is whole , but breaks down into smaller parts , but in an incredibly organic way .
why , we found , people were interested in this , is that at work they don &apos;t feel very expressed .
we need sustainable harmony . i love this term .
some things are certain , i think .
my mom &apos;s great-uncle was a jesuit priest .
one of the earlier results that we got — we have a singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a village of 25 vietnamese girls for their education , and that was one of the earliest results . and as i said , now there have been many , many stories that have come in , because we do have hundreds of charities in there , and the google foundation will be an even broader endeavor .
they look somewhat similar , but they mean very different things .
maybe we don &apos;t quite need the data , but we need reminders .
she says , &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t know , my mom always did it ! &quot; &quot; so they call grandma , and grandma says , &quot; &quot; my pan was too small ! &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so , it &apos;s not that we have good words and bad words .
by mid-century we &apos;ll be about 80 percent urban , and that &apos;s mostly in the developing world , where that &apos;s happening .
thank you .
here &apos;s a little caricature of a million individuals .
but compassion , from my vantage point , has a problem .
plank number one : adapt all the time .
just wanted to say , &quot; &quot; hey guys .
and two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people experience at that moment and the amount of skill that they feel they have at that moment .
he also runs this amazing drone mapping program , some of the images of which you can see behind me here and here .
do you know that today , there are over 70 million americans today who are underbanked , because existing banking services are not designed to address their basic needs .
women , celebrate your body , for god &apos;s sake .
it requires hundreds of steps , and it takes a long , long time .
but the money ran out .
so digging deeper into this with the science and technology council of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences reveals some truth behind the trickery .
and then we can debate , you know , is it better to be there , where performance is strong at the price of large disparities ?
they all have their breakfast and complain about everyone right there . and it &apos;s a great experience , and i really encourage you to drop in at that diner during that time , because that &apos;s quite essential american experience .
it was the most inspiring and empowering moment of my life .
many blind people use them to read pages on the web to themselves .
and you can see just what a shoestring operation this really was , because we cast these 16 blue leds in epoxy and you can see in the epoxy mold that we used , the word ziploc is still visible .
because in some way one could say sex isn &apos;t something you do , eh ?
that meant that in 1998 , the oldest among the group were only 14 , and the youngest , just four .
you need efforts to supplement schools .
they make balloon animals .
but the doctors of the day thought he was crazy , because they knew , and had for hundreds of years , that odorous vapors called miasmas caused disease , not these hypothetical particles that you couldn &apos;t see .
we haven &apos;t even started to try to solve the problems .
taniyama tried and tried and tried and he could never prove that it was true .
they came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread called carta musica made out of durum wheat , a type of cheese made from grass-fed animals so the cheese is high in omega-3 fatty acids instead of omega-6 fatty acids from corn-fed animals , and a type of wine that has three times the level of polyphenols than any known wine in the world .
the oceanographers , when they go and look at these hydrothermal vents , they &apos;re teeming with life , regardless of whether the water is acidic or alkaline — doesn &apos;t matter .
these thoughts were going through my head when i looked at the pages of my first dinosaur book .
and we looked at that and we said , we have to start much earlier .
i &apos;ll connect you , or say &quot; &quot; details , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; go back . &quot; &quot; dp : he &apos;s connecting me ! he doesn &apos;t even tell me the phone number .
you &apos;re immersed in the liquid .
the only thing anyone was trying to find out is what percentage of zambian children are vaccinated , and this is the data , collected on paper over weeks , from a single district , which is something like a county in the united states .
but that &apos;s only half of the story — 99.9 percent of the folding ratios produce not this , but this , the geometric equivalent of noise .
the attacks happened everywhere : in the hardware store , in my office , or even while reading a book in bed .
all stories interest me , and some haunt me until i end up writing them .
they even took the word &quot; &quot; citizen &quot; &quot; away from us , and imprisoned them for a whole year .
and i really think that &apos;s where we are .
thank you .
the visibility &apos;s 600 ft . ; we &apos;re on our safety lines ; the ice is moving all over the place .
our drinking water safe we make .
because it was when that happened with this walk-and-talk idea that things became doable and sustainable and viable .
and we believe that as designers , it holds us accountable to our customers .
very different notion .
these are my valentines from 2005 and 2006 .
and today , if you go to kurdistan , you &apos;ll see that kurdish peshmerga guerillas are squaring off against the sunni iraqi army .
in other words , the victim of an affair is not always the victim of the marriage .
i hope you are too .
and everyone agrees : politicians and scientists are in agreement that we are headed for a phosphorus crisis .
that &apos;s not being politically active , that &apos;s being bureaucratically active .
what about the problem of picking up a chess piece , dexterously manipulating it and putting it back down on the board ?
when i was a diplomat negotiating the disarmament treaties with the soviet union in geneva in the 1970s , we succeeded because we understood we shared a destiny with them .

there &apos;s something big and loud over here .
this fish actually has high beams .
everything is based on the files leaked by mr. snowden .
moral arguments within cultures are especially about issues of in-group , authority , purity .
mexico is not at all on par with the united states , but they are quite close .

similarly , the astronomer royal , whom we heard speak yesterday , also has a 50 percent probability estimate .
pm : so tell me , what do you look for in a friend ?
and it &apos;s the responsibility of the artist to ask questions about what that technology means and how it reflects our culture .
they feel fear and doubt . they procrastinate .
this image , to me , is almost like from a shakespearean play , with a man , surrounded by various influences , desperate to hold on to something true within himself , in a context of great suffering that he has created himself .
weather patterns have changed .
we can revert the malignant phenotype .
so this then seems pretty obvious that everything we &apos;ve achieved , and everything we care about , depends crucially on some relatively minor changes that made the human mind .
it &apos;s not a video game peripheral .

the smell of the garbage unloaded from those trucks was intense , and the noise of the traffic was loud and overbearing .
so i appreciate being here . thank you .
but basically by the time you &apos;re nine months and you &apos;re given birth , you have almost 60,000 miles of vessels inside your body .
so i came back to newcastle with these results and decided that there was something happening here that definitely was getting very serious .
and when i came out of my coma , i recognized my family , but i didn &apos;t remember my own past .
so again , you can see the extension of this great wall of galaxies showing up here .
( laughter ) so , you might say , ok , there are these differences between liberals and conservatives , but what makes those three other foundations moral ?
the top one , in fact , is walmart on the right .
maybe i can do this all the time .
you can make money , you can lose money in africa .
the meaning of her name is pig .
so we basically copied the format of the comic book to actually tell the stories of behind the scenes , how our projects actually evolve through adaptation and improvisation .
compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cross this tipping point .
it &apos;s really changed our lives in ways that are sort of imperceptible ; and yet , when you pull back , you see it all the time .
and if i tried , i &apos;d disappoint them .
and he studied — there was a film about king fishers .
black field , brown field , toxic waste field , battlefield — we &apos;re proving in the bronx that you can grow anywhere , on cement .
but at some point , he must have given up all hope .
so in 2000 , when it was announced that the citizenship application fee was going to more than double from 95 dollars to 225 dollars , i decided it was time to apply before i could no longer afford it .
so i remained with them , and the more i wrote that story , the more i got into those beliefs , and i think that &apos;s important for me — to take on the beliefs , because that is where the story is real , and that is where i &apos;m gonna find the answers to how i feel about certain questions that i have in life .
the thing about cancer — when i got into this , i really knew nothing about it , but working with david agus , i started watching how cancer was actually being treated and went to operations where it was being cut out .
a teacher once instructed me in the hallway : &quot; aaaaaas-king . &quot;
in a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute , only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have .
that &apos;s another piece .
( laughter ) yeah , i &apos;m not worried about it now .
so it &apos;s a really slow process , it &apos;s really expensive , and the outcome of that process , namely electronic circuit boards , are limited in all sorts of kind of interesting ways .
secondly , when we talk about men who are succeeding , we rightly consider them icons or pioneers or innovators to be emulated .
they &apos;re being generated at a pace that &apos;s far beyond what any human , or teams of humans , could hope to view , and you and i are contributing to that at this ted .
and this is really heavily backlit .
i see evidence everywhere of how it works .
and if your brain is failing at integrating bad news about the future , you will constantly leave your rose-tinted spectacles on .
when schools stop doing that all the time , i will admit that , yes , it &apos;s obvious that trial and error is a good thing .
some of you may wince to remember this riddle .
quantum mechanics was developed in the 1920s .
but excessive reliance on incentives demoralizes professional activity in two senses of that word .

i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m sorry , art center — art center is good , too .
an account that explains the presence of beauty in everything on this list is not going to be easy .
we should not shrink from this opportunity simply because we don &apos;t really understand it .
one of my students , who has now become an instructor , when he lost his vision , after a few months he was sitting in his three story house and he realized that he could hear everything going on throughout the house : conversations , people in the kitchen , people in the bathroom , several floors away , several walls away .
now , it was the courage and verve of radical designers like bucky and moholy that drew me to design .
think about that for a minute .
not stamps , but one day .
cheryl responded , &quot; &quot; well , first , i don &apos;t know what quinoa is . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) &quot; &quot; but i do know that it &apos;s a monday , and that in my school , at high school in the community , i always cook pasta . &quot; &quot; see , cheryl explained that for many of her kids , there were no meals on the weekends .
we can even add microprocessors and have this as an input and create squishy sound music that we &apos;ve done .
so far , a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music , but singers , like frank sinatra , could use the mic and do things that they could never do without a microphone .
so you ask about a defining moment — ain &apos;t no defining moment in american history for me .
that &apos;s a juvenile .
created after the post-election riots in kenya in 2008 , this crisis-mapping website and community is actually able to crowdsource and target the delivery of better rescue services to people trapped under the rubble , whether it &apos;s after the earthquakes in haiti , or more recently in italy .
about four months ago , we finally tied all this together and produced one of the first computer vision models that is capable of generating a human-like sentence when it sees a picture for the first time .

the next — second — equation says that there is no magnetism other than that .
( bono : yes ! ) andrew mwenda : i can see bono says he knows the country .
new models for pedagogy for the displaced .
and i ran the story and i said , &quot; &quot; what do you think ? &quot; &quot; and in the back of the room , a woman stood up and she said , &quot; &quot; in 35 years of living in this god forsaken place , you &apos;re the only person that &apos;s come down here and treated us with dignity .
she left , did the same thing — it was a 10-second conversation , such a short interaction .
and so i sat down to wait .
clearly , human locomotion is more complex than cat and salamander locomotion , but at the same time , the nervous system of humans is very similar to that of other vertebrates .
i was flying back to the u.s. from an exhibition overseas .
some use and advocate violence .
i take a picture of them everyday because i never know if i will make it back to them .
firstly , because greenhouse gases , once released , stay in the atmosphere for decades .
you &apos;d just have information come to you as you needed it .
think of the allosphere as a large , dynamically varying digital microscope that &apos;s connected to a supercomputer .
and he gets right over the trap , and i see that he &apos;s seen it .
i was in the gulf , and i was swimming around and saw a little octopus on the bottom .
and so , of course , i decided to create an art installation called the dna vending machine .
energy is the key factor here . it changed everything .
it has truly revolutionized the way we communicate on the planet .
and somehow , these most essential workers are also among the world &apos;s most underpaid and exploited today .
i started in 1999 to try and address this problem with an experiment , which was a very simple experiment in new delhi .
i can &apos;t tell you how reassured i was by the very last sentence in that glorious presentation by dean kamen a few days ago .
i enjoyed being pregnant . i loved it .
but i wanted the score of a game to be the byproduct of these other things , and not the end itself .
you could take these special unpaid leave , as they called them , and yet remain part of the diplomatic service , but not actually do any work .
this is a whole wall of bananas at different ripenesses on the opening day in this gallery in new york .
which means that each and every one of you here today knows at least one child that is suffering from a developmental disorder .
( laughter ) but what makes our experiences perhaps a little bit different and a little more unique than that of the average person is that we have this gnawing thing in the back of our mind that even in our darkest moments , and those times of despair , we think , &quot; &quot; hey , there might be an image to be made here , there might be a story to be told . &quot; &quot; and why is storytelling important ?
but there &apos;s also a certain beauty within this technology .
people who happened to be women didn &apos;t have the same rights , couldn &apos;t vote .
visible light has a wavelength , a size , that &apos;s much smaller than the things around you , the features on people &apos;s faces , the size of your cell phone .
it turns out , when you add mobility — the ability to roll around the table — you get a little more of a boost .
so if you take , say , natural gas , which is the most prevalent hydrocarbon source fuel , if you burn that in a modern general electric natural gas turbine , you &apos;ll get about 60 percent efficiency .
and this problem is : where are the plants ?
it evolves .
it &apos;s a very holistic way of improving the lives of the people living in the villages around the park .
some of it even came from lianas , those things that dangle in the middle of the jungle .
and then it &apos;s a high savings rate .
no , i &apos;m not even going to look up . no . &quot; &quot; to understand why this is happening to us , and what we can do about it , we need to learn more about moral psychology .
but not all the vessels have those to date .
and they decided to tell me that i could see .
tm : ok , now for all the talking , and inspiring , and possibility-modeling we &apos;ve done , we &apos;ve been nowhere near perfect .
fatah , hamas and the popular front !
what happens right now , though , is that we have this mixing airflow pattern .
and i wanted to see — i want to dedicate this film to my father , homer .
haryana is a state which has 30 million people .
the idea is that , with free electricity , they will no longer have to use firewood to cook their food .
so , i was going to throw some condoms in the room and whatnot , but i &apos;m not sure it &apos;s the etiquette here .
well i don &apos;t have time to tell you about all the mathematics , but underlying this is the social networks , because this is a universal phenomenon .
and we &apos;ve never looked back .
it started out in the &apos; 80s , but at the beginning it was machines carving out of a foam block a model that was very , very fragile , and could not have any real use .
this was a brain that paid its dues .
in spite of what some people in the press don &apos;t get it , didn &apos;t understand it , we didn &apos;t take it off because we didn &apos;t want to do — having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want .
they do this with their toes . it &apos;s bizarre ! this peeling inspired irobot — that we work with — to build mecho-geckos .
we have this war with iran coming for 10 years now , and we have people , you know , afraid .
bringing up three children when you &apos;re the world &apos;s richest family seems like a social experiment without much prior art .
( singing ) ( laughter ) and i took a high-speed video of my throat while i was humming .
all right , so you get your little tutorial right there .
and it &apos;s expanding .
i was a misfit .
within 12 hours , i was horribly sunburned , just like richard dreyfuss in the movie .
the stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter .
all right , let me show you some more about this .
this is clara , a famous rhinoceros that was traveling europe in the mid-1700s , at a time when seeing a rhino was an exciting rarity .
i am a leader , so i know i cannot do anything alone .
but we know that occasionally ants go astray , and what happens is that , if army ants are wandering around and they get lost , they start to follow a simple rule — just do what the ant in front of you does .
salmon is a carnivore , it has no way to digest soy .
this is where we want to get , though , in the next three years .
all right , i can see a rhinovirus — and here &apos;s the blow-up of the rhinovirus &apos;s little barcode — but what about different rhinoviruses ?
they were delighted , and by the time it was time to go see the principal , whom they &apos;d actually come to see — not the computer room — they went upstairs and they said , &quot; &quot; this is absolutely remarkable !
of course , there are the bases , which refer to specific sexual activities that happen in a very specific order , ultimately resulting in scoring a run or hitting a home run , which is usually having vaginal intercourse to the point of orgasm , at least for the guy .
so as a great physicist once said , there &apos;s these little upstream eddies of biology that create order in this rapid torrent of entropy .
people look at the roads , for example , and they &apos;d say , &quot; angola : 90 percent of roads are untarred . ah , problem ! &quot;
this is sea-monkeys .
uncontacted peoples hold a mystical and iconic role in our imagination .
let &apos;s journey together . let &apos;s journey together .
the way we do that , i believe , is at the level of the city .
we &apos;re the ones who have to do it .
so you just get a bigger and bigger ball of whatever that is mixed with your tears on your eye until eventually , the ball becomes so big that the surface tension takes it across the bridge of your nose like a tiny little waterfall and goes &quot; &quot; goosh &quot; &quot; into your other eye , and now i was completely blind outside the spaceship .
so next time you &apos;re talking to a stranger and you feel comfortable , tell them something true about yourself , something really personal .
other places , gmo is saving the world .
but think again . why should that be always the case ?
but then along came the industrial revolution , and then goods became the predominant economic offering , where we used commodities as a raw material to be able to make or manufacture goods .
and it &apos;s viewed in those sort of idealistic terms .
i work with really amazing , little , itty-bitty creatures called cells .
( laughter ) and when the crisis was happening , the head of quantitative equities at lehman brothers said , &quot; &quot; events which models predicted would happen once every 10,000 years happened every day for three days . &quot; &quot; so , it &apos;s extraordinary . it &apos;s a new world that &apos;s very , very difficult to make sense of .
now what i like about this video is it &apos;s actually a video of the first time they ever danced together because of his lead . he had a strong lead .
i graduated .
and at the same time , you have a number that you can call to get more information on commuting , or a low-interest loan on a different kind of car , or whatever it is you &apos;re going to need to actually reduce your gasoline dependence .
so now we faced , you know , a little bit of a problem here .
tattoo was , at one time , a kind of a blacklisted or con thing , but now it is in thing .
so if you put these physiological processes to work , i &apos;d hypothesize that it might be our increased intake of refined grains , sugars and starches that &apos;s driving this epidemic of obesity and diabetes , but through insulin resistance , you see , and not necessarily through just overeating and under-exercising .
so i immediately decided , this is going to be the name of the game , or my new exclamation .
so this morning i &apos;m going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand .
i &apos;m just the same as everybody else . &quot; &quot; and i think that &apos;s actually a really telling answer , because it suggests that the circles of these altruists don &apos;t look like this , they look more like this .
it &apos;s almost as though most of gravity has gone missing .
he makes us the subject of his art .
so , it &apos;s about choosing the parts of the bible about compassion , about tolerance , about loving your neighbor , as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin , or intolerance , or violence , which are very much in the bible as well .
plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cooling load by a third .
or if they do have our interests at heart , we worry that they don &apos;t know us well enough to figure out what they need to do in order to allow us to secure those interests .
( applause ) thank you . thank you very much . thank you . thank you very much .
i had a lot of journalists calling me , asking me , &quot; &quot; which is the test they &apos;re going to run that will tell us whether or not caster semenya is male or female ? &quot; &quot; and i had to explain to the journalists there isn &apos;t such a test .
look into those eyes . i &apos;m not able to focus those eyes .
and there are a lot of other problems with that . it &apos;s very hard to do .
but you will remain one of the most important superpowers , and the most hopeful superpower , for the time to be .
in a primitive and simple world , there &apos;s really no reason for a model because feeling is close to reality .
i could get you admitted right away , and the whole thing could be very discrete . &apos; &apos; ha , ha , ha .
you cannot say it &apos;s a mere treatment 10,000 dollars , but because you are poor i &apos;ll give it for 9,000 .
redemption songs .
the physicians of the ancient world — especially the egyptians , who started medicine as we know it — were very conscious of what they could and couldn &apos;t treat .
and if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks , it &apos;s worth 100 bucks no matter what you &apos;re saving it on . people don &apos;t think that way .
they tend to be creative . they tend to be entrepreneurial .
we &apos;re not interested in your help . &quot; &quot; and he threw me out of the room .
what i find amazing is that africa is transcending its geography problem .
and it turns out that as we called around to the independent crash test companies around the country , none of them wanted to do our crash test because they said , some explicitly , some not so explicitly , &quot; &quot; all of our business comes from car seat manufacturers .
now , similarly , in locke ’ s society there are individuals who have certain rights , properties in a formal sense , and those are defined with respect to some absolute , abstract notions of rights and justice , and so forth , which are independent of what else has happened in the society .
these are survival skills .
and indeed , i think , rather than being annihilated , the performing arts are poised on the brink of a time when we will be more important than we have ever been .
now , we &apos;re all here to dream , but maybe if we &apos;re honest about it , each of us chasing our own dream .
this is due to the attraction and the repulsion of the individual particles inside the liquid .
we &apos;re going to speak now to the operations center .
then we made these legs that are cast in soil with a potato root system growing in them , and beetroots out the top , and a very lovely brass toe .
but i &apos;m obsessive , so i couldn &apos;t just stop there , so i actually started modifying the bunks where you could actually slide out the bunks and slide in desks or shelving , so the same unit can now be used for an office or storage location .
well , ultimately , it could mean that you could print your own medicine .
it was , what i would say , compositional complexity , and i felt that if i had to fulfill what i talked about — a building for science — there had to be some kind of a generating idea , some kind of a generating geometry .
they said , we won &apos;t think about it until we know it &apos;s right .
rb : philippe is quite erratic , so i think that he wouldn &apos;t be the best person to design the engine , no .
so we were the first to actually name a bird from the famous series that later exploded onto the pages of science and nature .
well before i go any further , this is something worth sharing .
and there was something very moving about all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky .
well , i finally decided i needed to lose weight , and i knew i could because i &apos;d done it so many times before , so i simply stopped eating as much .
and if you &apos;re in the half-mile radius of where this bomb went off , you have a 90 percent chance of not making it .
and when i started out , i was just using these blue duct-tape filters over my strobe , so i could make sure i &apos;m actually seeing the light that &apos;s being transformed by the animals .
we need more than that . where do we draw the line ?
some of us have a burglar alarm system at home , and some of us don &apos;t .
he saw that first glint of light — he knew what the weather was going to be three days from now .
we might even call them citizens , because they &apos;ve recently risen up to fight against legislative incursion , and the citizens of these networks work together to serve each other in great ways .
a plant , quite simply , needs light , it needs co2 , but even more importantly , it needs nutrients , which it draws from the soil .
i remember one day , it was a very hot day in the spring , and we hadn &apos;t been in a fight in a couple of weeks , maybe .
obviously that doesn &apos;t work very well for — ca : what just happened there ? we just saw something land ?
they hatched out in india .
so what we need is space inside the aircraft , inside a very dense area .
now , would that this were just about sarah palin and her reality tv show .
and i learned a new word last week .
and hence , the enormous role that a marine protected area can play .
he &apos;s standing the watch in helmand , in southern afghanistan .
many had undiagnosed conditions like multiple sclerosis , epilepsy , brain tumors .
i can &apos;t forget auntie .
you get divided , and a continent &apos;s division corresponds to a fork in the evolutionary tree , or you &apos;re crafty , and you manage to escape from one to the other and erase that division , or you &apos;re living peacefully on each side , and on one side you just go extinct , and you survive on the other side and create a difference .
make a decision and give me some blood .
i don &apos;t want him killed . i know he &apos;s going to love cliffs .
and her voice was the most powerful voice .
yeah . jack — you &#91; unclear &#93; with jack ? jack
but as i sat there for four hours , the full afternoon , reading maslow , i recognized something that is true of most leaders .
because , you know , most people , when they hear that i predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more , they think that i &apos;m saying that we &apos;re going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more .
you know about objects and their properties .
where do you see your doctor and your dentist ? &quot; &quot; then i &apos;m very much of the united states , and i have been for 48 years now , since i was a really small child .
but a lot of times , whole categories of innovation — ones that can help us live more beautifully — turn out to be illegal .
they wouldn &apos;t go listen to him .
no democracy anywhere in the world offers this feature to its citizens for either legislation or for budgets , even though those are the things done with our consent and with our money .
and he was soon controlling huge servers around the world where he stored his games that he had cracked and pirated .
howard is not so easily placated .
ag : so we know that young people are the present and the future , but what inspires me are older people who are becoming transformed in the service of this movement .
now , in a situation where the best current treatment is inexpensive and simple to deliver , the answer is straightforward .
around the world , my shows air in 256 territories in 67 languages for an audience of 30 million people .
but even after months of working feverishly — sleeping in our offices and not going home , candy bars for dinner , coffee by the bucketful — physicists are machines for turning coffee into diagrams — ( laughter ) this little bump would not go away .
so the first time i worked with colors was by making these mosaics of pantone swatches .
when i went to sleep , the next day it wasn &apos;t there .
if you want to add to this picture and try and sketch it globally , you really have to force yourself to go down to the four corners of the earth — africa , india , antarctica , australia — and start putting together some of these pieces .
so john &apos;s now 18 months further down in that journey , and i &apos;ve now asked him to tell us something about his current predicament .
so i &apos;m looking , really , for a mentor , because i just had my birthday .
and it is a true challenge , and i do want you to help me .

edison stated it best . he said , &quot; &quot; hell , we ain &apos;t got no rules around here , we &apos;re trying to accomplish something . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so , how do you restore trust ?
because it took negotiation for almost every one of these photographs — to get into that place to make those photographs , and if it wasn &apos;t for those people letting me in at the heads of those corporations , i would have never made this body of work .
why couldn &apos;t masa have taken an airplane to sweden ?
we &apos;d actually — ( laughter ) it would be harder . it would take — take 2 would be a bitch .
( applause )
i believe we can connect every school in ethiopia , every health clinic , every hospital — we can connect to the internet .
you should be nice to nerds .
getting to school , for a kid that was actually pretty short for his age , through the canadian winter , was not a pleasant experience .
mt : sorry . now , one way of persuading humans that robots are safe is to create the illusion of trust .
the flashlight gives us this really intense , bright l.e.d. , and six hours worth of rechargeable battery pack , and the lunch box is a nice little package in which you can put everything inside , and a bunch of mini speakers to sort of amplify the sound large enough .
this bias and systematic lack of engagement of indigenous people in both clinical trials and genome studies is partially the result of a history of distrust .
so , sometimes , wolfram alpha will be able to do the whole thing immediately and just give back a whole big program that you can then compute with .
thanks .
i used to be a fan of bach .
they are a kind of social capital .
( laughter ) and so , to me , i wanted more value in this , so when she asked if she could play a game , i said , &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and so i happened to have all of these little pieces .
you see the canal they dug ?
i went to teach seventh graders math in the new york city public schools .
and that is , to me , the sign of a masterpiece , of a painting when there &apos;s a lack of resolution .
so we won &apos;t give the rest of the code , but we will give the three quotations .
and the question is , should we run them or not ?
you can &apos;t be a feminist who &apos;s also interested in fashion .
the future research is &quot; &quot; how can we find the genetic and molecular markers for the viability of seeds , without having to plant them every 10 years ? &quot; &quot; and we &apos;re almost there .
so unfortunately , this orphan spends most of his time in storage , along with quite a number of other orphans , some of them some beautiful paintings .
this was a golden age of bipartisanship , at least in terms of the parties &apos; ability to work together and solve grand national problems .
well , eventually i learned enough english , and my parents were so happy the day that i got into medical school and took my oath of healing and service .
we then use optical sorting to color sort this material .
and i will be in your corner for the rest of your life . &quot; &quot; for me , that is the power of girls .
finally , this is a 26-year-old nun i spoke to .
it &apos;s our own pond . and that &apos;s how it happens . &quot; &quot; and she goes , &quot; &quot; then how do they get fertilized ? &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; well , men , through their penis , they fertilize the eggs by the sperm coming out .
toxic waste , i guess , is the key clue to that one .
it craves stories of success in dealing with complex issues , especially in developing countries .
the ashaninka people are known throughout south america for their dignity , their spirit and their resistance , starting with the incas and continuing through the 19th century with the rubber tappers .
and then there is social media , and what &apos;s happening on the internet .
and it feels just incredibly cool to do that .

there are hundreds of them all over the earth , but in this country , james van praagh is very big .
we &apos;ve got to confront that reality .
they accompany me wherever i go in my life , and i fill them with all sorts of things , records of my lived experience : so watercolor paintings , drawings of what i see , dead flowers , dead insects , pasted ticket stubs , rusting coins , business cards , writings .
so i should say , i guess , that since the time of that original president johnson report , and the various reports of the u.s. national academy — 1977 , 1982 , 1990 — people always talked about this idea .
that hit a wall . they couldn &apos;t shrink them and keep the vacuum .
among the most pressing challenges that our species is faced with today are the chronic problems of africa .
the hospital put him on a water drip for three days .
it took me several months to design the column , but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces .
there &apos;s lots of room , so people can come up and understand what it is before they get involved .
so i want to tell you about someone like this that i know .
think of this as a form of edited biology .
we &apos;ll go over to jacques tati here and grab our blue friend and put him down on the table as well .
there she is .
maybe not surprisingly , in the deep ocean , where it &apos;s mostly blue , the photoreceptors tend to see blue light .
whether it &apos;s a &quot; &quot; floral fusion &quot; &quot; or a &quot; &quot; paradise winds , &quot; &quot; they &apos;ll have their chance .
when was the last time you were at ted and you got to connect physically with every single person in the room ?
so anyway , she comes here , 1967 , she &apos;s pregnant , and she comes from ethiopia that was celebrating its own jubilee at the time under the emperor haile selassie , and she lands months before the enoch powell speech , the &quot; &quot; rivers of blood &quot; &quot; speech .
so , everything that i put into my body , i considered as medicine .
it &apos;s such a big problem , so complex . can we really do it ?
so , what if you could get your gas at a 10th the price ?
she also creates life-size fiberglass sculptures , often of animals , which she then completely covers in bindis , often with potent symbolism .
and you can &apos;t just draw them arbitrarily .
first we &apos;ll see the animals toes peeling — look at that .
and if you don &apos;t know where to find someone different , go to the places you wouldn &apos;t usually go .
and what looks like two big heaps of leaves , is actually two single leaves that get shredded up by the harsh desert conditions over time .
and we &apos;re acting out of that fear .
if you are trying to solve a really hard problem , you can speak up and be color brave .
this is hitting the reservoirs .
on twitter that night , we were like toddlers crawling towards a gun .
well real organized crime on the internet goes back about 10 years when a group of gifted ukrainian hackers developed a website , which led to the industrialization of cybercrime .
and after noah built his ark , i believe he told noah to warn the people that they must change all their wicked ways before he come upon them and destroy them .
because here &apos;s the crazy thing : in law enforcement , we have evolved into something incredible .
these were networks of mercenaries , not ideologues , who were in the coordination business for profit .
and when you &apos;re hungry , food becomes more attractive , and so forth .
it &apos;s their right to fight . &quot; &quot; now as you know , mandela didn &apos;t do that .
going back to the beginning of our country — historically , defenses meant protection of the homeland .
i collect autographed books , and those of you authors in the audience know i hound you for them — and cds too , tracy .
so we had jonathan train with the vest for four days , two hours a day , and here he is on the fifth day .
they can be shocking or silly or soulful .
this is the mechanism by which you lower blood pressure , by which you dilate the coronary arteries also , to let the blood be supplied with the heart .
i sit on the board of a center for the developmentally disabled , and these people want laughter and compassion and they want love .
now to bring home the point of how close it is — the relationship between the grid of neurons and the topographical arrangement of the activity of the neurons and our mental experience — i &apos;m going to tell you a personal story .
does your work relate to his ?
we &apos;ve actually kind of made an ethical choice in society to not have coral reefs .
so here are some of the technical terms , all three-letter things , that you &apos;ll see a lot more of .
and even animals , like these donkeys , love our buildings .
so where are we ?
this work , which was published in &quot; &quot; nature , &quot; &quot; late 2009 , after a number of years of analysis , led to the final proposition that we can only find nine planetary boundaries with which , under active stewardship , would allow ourselves to have a safe operating space .
ak : wow , a hundred million miles away . this is crazy !
we just dismiss it out of our consciousness .
here &apos;s the first easy problem : you can have 60 dollars now or 50 dollars now . which would you prefer ?
so imagine , if you as a high school can have the satellite for a week and do satellite space experiments like that .
those were the achievements of our great regime .
you see , we tend to think the problem is solved when we solve the technology problem .
so why is that happening ?
so listening to this brought something to the ear besides the obvious burst .
one is in india , where there are 240 million farmers , most of whom make less than two dollars a day .
and this routine went on for some time .
in order not to steal it from our children , we have to do two things .
and they just wiped out — these pathogens just wiped out the native people , who had no immunity to them at all .
i have here a model of the sky that corresponds to the real sky . okay ?
they dropped it , they walked away , but they were arrested .
and the reason why i bring up radio is that i think radio is a great example of how a new medium defines new formats which then define new stories .
and if i can get the camera — okay , great — you &apos;ll see , as i get sort of close ...
in fact , i view the two forces as fusing together into what i call &quot; &quot; connectography . &quot; &quot; connectography represents a quantum leap in the mobility of people , resources and ideas , but it is an evolution , an evolution of the world from political geography , which is how we legally divide the world , to functional geography , which is how we actually use the world , from nations and borders , to infrastructure and supply chains .
another flash alerts you to an open receiver .
and if you &apos;re a leader , the people who count on you need you on your feet .
can you say &quot; &quot; raw &quot; &quot; ?
so , it has to end with this — ( laughter ) — gratuitous violence . ( laughter )
well , how do we boot up a chromosome ? how do we activate this ?
and so the first thought that came to mind is , everywhere we park we have electric power .
tell us briefly about that and your role in that .
it is very scary to go through that feeling of &quot; &quot; i am about to die &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; i could die in this explosion . &quot; &quot; but there &apos;s also the fear of losing loved ones , and i think that &apos;s even worse .
and this turns out to be useful .
second of all , the court doubled down on this exclusion by making it legally inconsequential .
let &apos;s talk about billions . let &apos;s talk about
being criminalized leaves you exposed to mistreatment by the state itself .
and you know , it &apos;s just one of the great things about being a musician , is that it is so unbelievably fluid .
it means &quot; &quot; i have enough . &quot; &quot; and that is utterly true .
the concept that they &apos;re working towards — and they have working prototypes — is that we placed it throughout the motor points of the body where they &apos;re needed .
so my freshman year of college i signed up for an internship in the housing unit at greater boston legal services .
it &apos;s not a lot of money at the global level .
tolerance is not really a lived virtue ; it &apos;s more of a cerebral ascent .
and as far as isolation goes , when we as a species do colonize distant planets , there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way .
( laughter ) sr : are you convinced ?
what if , in the coming crowd of nine billion ...
two men , rahul and rajiv , living in the same neighborhood , from the same educational background , similar occupation , and they both turn up at their local accident emergency complaining of acute chest pain .
so when the echo of the gunshots had lingered , it was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob , and i didn &apos;t believe what i was hearing .
now , here &apos;s the story .
the colors show the continent .
so in fact , the price of timber in the beijing marketplace ought to have been three-times what it was had it reflected the true pain and the costs to the society within china .
and yet you don &apos;t put a letter after that first &quot; &quot; t. &quot; &quot; why ? because it wouldn &apos;t have been useful in the past .
so one of the people that i met was a senior bush administration official , who had this to say about our unmanning of war : &quot; &quot; it plays to our strength . the thing that scares people is our technology . &quot; &quot; but when you go out and meet with people , for example in lebanon , it &apos;s a very different story . one of the people i met with there was a news editor , and we &apos;re talking as a drone is flying above him , and this is what he had to say .
it &apos;s brought a lot of bad stuff , like the stuff that i just described , but it &apos;s also brought a lot of good stuff .
right now , her favorite character is groot .
well , what happened when i was a little kid was — some pretty heavy stuff too .
this light switch that reads , on the one hand , flashfloods , and on the other hand , off .
this plus the fact that you &apos;ve got phenomenal work from ceos from ford to zappos , connecting on twitter , creating an open environment , allowing their employees to be part of the process , rather than hidden behind walls .
and the blue hoods helped us with two things : one , we could easily erase their heads ; and we also put tracking markers on their heads so we could recreate the camera motion and the lens optics from the set .
thank you for your kind attention .
it &apos;s really a time machine .
here &apos;s the gecko running up a vertical surface . there it goes , in real time . there it goes again . obviously , we have to slow this down a little bit .
so of course , labor isn &apos;t free , on that practical versus awesome spectrum .
and that &apos;s that the company and the building was multiform .
the other kind of reviewer is a certain flavor of feminist who thinks they know what little girls ought to be .
and then i started to think , ok , well now this thing is probably just laughing at me , because it hasn &apos;t left , and i probably just look like this impotent , powerless thing that couldn &apos;t get it to go away .
and the prophet , in one of his sayings , said , &quot; adorn yourselves with the attributes of god . &quot;
but over time , interestingly enough , this concept adopted the branching schema of a tree in what became known as the porphyrian tree , also considered to be the oldest tree of knowledge .
most people think that i was an actress . i was never an actress . &quot; &quot; but i hadn &apos;t asked that , and then she went off on a tear , and she said , &quot; &quot; oh , well , there was that one time that i was an actress .
and we &apos;re alive .
darwin also has a lot of other talents .
now , as a mother , what do i want the very most for my children ?
because everybody is downstream , downwind of whatever is done .
a storm blew in that no one was anticipating .
and this idea of machine learning is going everywhere .
you can see the united states and california and san diego , and you can use the mouse or the keyboard to spin things around .
and we have this kind of — as voters , we have kind of a &quot; &quot; eureka ! &quot; &quot; moment .
we then take this vascular structure and we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply .
with the millions of visitors that come every year , it &apos;s actually one of the best places to try to invent the museum of the future .
i &apos;m told they don &apos;t bite ; in fact , they might not even leave that jar .
if the state is more than just a market fixer , if it actually is a market shaper , and in doing that has had to take on this massive risk , what happened to the reward ?
we &apos;ve developed this ability because it makes evolutionary sense .
each of us , every day , need just eight glasses of this , because we &apos;re human .
and then i actually slow down my whole nervous system .
those are goat babies .
and when the vaccine appeared last winter , there were a lot of people — a surprising number — who refused to get it — as a nice example of how people &apos;s feelings of security change , how their model changes , sort of wildly with no new information , with no new input .
over 50 new countries were born .
and then i took an inventory of the characteristics , along with her , of the of the capabilities and elements of different dancers who &apos;d won championships .
another important idea is this notion of persistence of character across realities .
and this ceremony has to take place in front of the eyes of the whole community with everyone &apos;s participation .
but the cyclist , we see , is going to proceed through the intersection .
a local official literally prostrated himself in the street , in front of these protesters , in order to get them to go away .
these are rounded numbers .
and then pushing the glass in with its own friction .
we can choose life over fear .
so when you finally actually get outside on a spacewalk , it feels much different than it would if you just went out first time .
so , sarah and i — my wife — walked over to the public library , which is four blocks away , on pacific street , and we got the oed , and we looked in there , and there are 14 definitions of hope , none of which really hits you between the eyes as being the appropriate one .
you now , our brain is two to three percent of the body mass , but actually it uses 25 percent of the total energy we use .
if l &apos;oréal in india , in the philippines , in brazil and in russia can do it , you can , too .
and we &apos;re starting in june . so this is the monsoon rain .
i &apos;m a visual artist .
we will need a robust cybersecurity approach that protects sensitive information and intellectual property and safeguards critical infrastructure from cyberattacks .
no , we learned something else .
perhaps because a lesson had been learned by the weak response to the war in bosnia and the failure in rwanda , when serbia attacked kosovo , international action was taken much more decisively .
your politician &apos;s always echoing that trickle-down idea by saying things like , &quot; &quot; well , if you raise the price of employment , guess what happens ? you get less of it . &quot; &quot; are you sure ?
cmus aren &apos;t solitary confinement , but they radically restrict all of these to levels that meet or exceed the most extreme prisons in the united states .
and i started doing research , and we found , very excitingly , that the skin produces nitric oxide .
this was not something that happened with regularity back then in 1998 , and by this , i mean the stealing of people &apos;s private words , actions , conversations or photos , and then making them public — public without consent , public without context , and public without compassion .
you &apos;re just two people shouting out barely related sentences in the same place .
one of the fundamental characteristics of a network is that , once you are linked in the network , the network starts to shape your views and starts to shape your interactions with everybody else .
( applause ) because ladies and gentlemen , that &apos;s my day job .
and so , a lot of what has been done with people like danny hillis and others is to try to bring in engineering principles , try to bring the software .
and you know , we love grandma and we love uncle joe . we do .
this sounds great . a lot of people agree .
but because of writers like chinua achebe and camara laye , i went through a mental shift in my perception of literature .
there is no keyboard standard because there &apos;s no market .
what i discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces .
together , the central banks of the u.s. , u.k and japan increased the stock of money in their economies by 3.7 trillion dollars .
and it &apos;s a very horrible thing to see anarchy , to know that the police and the military — there were lots of military troops there — actually can &apos;t stop that rampaging mob who &apos;s coming down the street .
to mention just a few examples , our lives are longer , materially much richer , and less plagued by violence than are the lives of people in traditional societies .
as a patient , i need to do sit and stand movements , and when i stand up , i bid for the items i want to buy .
these are the ones where you have to press what floor you &apos;re going to go to before you get in the elevator .
and so if we can learn lessons from the innovators in every sector , then in the future we make together , that happiness can be just as ubiquitous as coca-cola .
and they &apos;re going to be playing this clip : &quot; i &apos;m such a good mother . &quot;
since then , no one has ever skied — this was 93 years ago — since then , no one has ever skied from the coast of antarctica to the pole and back .
and you can see , eventually the airport actually flips directions .
i do believe if we build a movement that &apos;s one million americans strong , we &apos;re not going to be denied .
there have been several close calls .
three months after that , i did my first runway show for alexander mcqueen on a pair of hand-carved wooden legs made from solid ash .
( laughter ) one of my most recent endeavors is to try to translate the habits of creativity that i &apos;ve learned into something others can replicate .
as china plays such an important role in the global economy and geopolitics , the decisions made based on the zodiac and other chinese traditions end up impacting everyone around the world .
we have all this at the same time .
the goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have ; the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe .
a marvelous place .
who will win ? canada ? russia ? the united states ?
but they are falling only slowly , because in botswana , with good economy and governance , they can manage to treat people .
it was just lying on the surface .
when you provide such a focus point , a swarm intelligence emerges .
and this graph sort of sums up what the problem is .
steaming ought to be faster .
and the starshade is a very specially shaped screen and the goal is to fly that starshade so it blocks out the light of a star so that the telescope can see the planets directly .
i &apos;m very , very , very inspired by movies .
we were driving with friends down a dark road at night , when a police car stopped us .
this species lives only in the congo .
( laughter ) so he sat me down , and he warned me .
so , if i simplify the laws of simplicity , i have what &apos;s called the cookie versus laundry thing .
and much of the political and social history of the last 200 years involved what to do with this class , and the new problems and opportunities .
and i &apos;m so glad to be here , and i &apos;m very grateful to be here , chris .
gross .
es : it &apos;s no mystery that there are governments out there that want to see me dead .
&quot; electricity . &quot;
and then jay chiat , a friend and client , asked me to do his headquarters building in l.a.
everyone was very excited about this archaeological find , because it meant that they might finally be able to assemble a single dodo skeleton .
as i &apos;m signing on to the various dating websites , as it happens , i was really , really busy .
and the world population in the meantime has doubled .
the young accused the old .
so while pgp does a great job of what it &apos;s designed to do , for the people out there who can &apos;t understand how to use it , the option to communicate privately simply does not exist .
and so , as we get to stage 12 and we partake of that , again completing the life cycle , you know , we have a chance to essentially ingest that — it nurtures us , and we continue to carry on and have opportunities to ponder things like this .
it &apos;s not clear why they thought she had the flu , but they switched to tamiflu .
but i did find myself wondering , what &apos;s happening now ?
and i thought to myself , well , that &apos;s well outside my lifetime , and a much greater figure than the predictions for oil .
in the congo , for those of you who don &apos;t know , there has been a war raging for the last 12 years , a war that has killed nearly six million people .
1939 , that &apos;s when they discovered oil .
i found neruda scribbled on a piece of paper in a field hospital in tahrir , and i decided to take a no of mamluk mausoleum in cairo .
i &apos;m going to share with you four of those commitments now .
it &apos;s about what we do right here , right now , and for the rest of our working lives .
so imagine white guys pasting white papers .
but e-miles follow moore &apos;s law .
in other words , what are the costs of doing business as usual ?
that &apos;s year by year . this comes from our friends at gapminder.com.
they have flown in the past , but without saving capabilities , without batteries .
( laughter ) okay , here &apos;s another question : do you think of yourself as spiritual in any way , shape or form ? raise your hand .
okay . right to left , how many ? okay .
buy it anyway .
yet actually , whenever we talk about human rights , we do say that human rights are universal .
we can flag that and we can put it to the side , and people who are buyers and consumers don &apos;t have to deal with it .
and this trend of what rachel naomi remen is doing , how these kinds of virtues are finding a place in the vocabulary of medicine — the work fred luskin is doing — i think this is one of the most fascinating developments of the 21st century — that science , in fact , is taking a virtue like compassion definitively out of the realm of idealism .
she scared us with the lava man is coming , then the tsunami is coming , but then finally there were flowers and trees , and it was very beautiful .
you know , we &apos;re pumping out lots of co2 into the atmosphere , from fossil fuels , from cement production .
well , i should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensors stopped working .
the weight is really difficult when it &apos;s up above your head .
but i persevered , and i eventually conducted some experiments deep in the forest , 25 years ago .
he couldn &apos;t free himself from personal problems and personal evils that included murder and adultery .
modeling : on the right hand side , there &apos;s a very complex computational model .
yellow is so-so , and in green are the countries doing really well .
because we are all dependent on these water sources .
i &apos;d gone up to photograph orcas , and we had looked for a week , and we hadn &apos;t seen a damn orca .
so here &apos;s the sound that we played in the room .
here is this diagram in crochetness .
today we have the opportunity , and we have the imperative , to create thousands of new ways of interconnecting between networks and institutions , thousands of new kinds of juries : the citizen jury , the carrotmob , the hackathon , we are just beginning to invent the models by which we can cocreate the process of governance .
this was taken in the old croton aqueduct , which supplied fresh water to new york city for the first time .
and here studying , in three dimensions , how to give some kind , again , of order , a structure ; not something you feel you could just change because you stop the design of that particular process .
your new joint venture partner might shake your hand , celebrate , go out to dinner with you and then leak an expression of anger .
and then something for me changed pretty profoundly .
and here &apos;s an interesting map .
so can you imagine the situation — she walks all this way to go get her injection .
so for instance , we told some people , &quot; &quot; look , you can buy the sweater , but you can &apos;t tell anybody you own it , and you can &apos;t resell it . &quot; &quot; that drops the value of it , suggesting that that &apos;s one reason why we like it .
bg : a personal question , and this is the last one .
the globalization of power — we talk about the globalization of markets , but actually it &apos;s the globalization of real power .
and that &apos;s why i believe that groups like ted , discussions like this around the planet , are the place where the future of foreign policy , of economic policy , of social policy , of philosophy , will ultimately take place .
here &apos;s one : &quot; &quot; gold gab ich für eisen , 1813 . &quot; &quot; the interesting thing is that for 50 years hence , the highest status jewelry you could wear in prussia wasn &apos;t made of gold or diamonds .
but it &apos;s not just the mortality from these disorders .
and one day he couldn &apos;t add up a line of figures .
by the way , i &apos;m teaching you how to use our website , gapminder world , while i &apos;m correcting this , because this is a free utility on the net .
you may have heard about rathergate , which was basically the result of bloggers realizing that the &quot; &quot; th &quot; &quot; in 111 is not typeset on an old typewriter ; it &apos;s on word .
but we want to make them have enough information that we can get the cells to do what we want , but not be so complex as to make it difficult to get to clinic .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not limited to the james camerons of the world , but something that we &apos;re all participating in .
but it &apos;s now your turn .
because we &apos;d been held up in russia , of course , the full moon brings the highest and lowest tides ; when you &apos;re standing on the frozen surface of the sea , high and low tides generally mean that interesting things are going to happen — the ice is going to start moving around a bit .
and then as we go further , today we have continuous glucose sensors .
your mission is to figure out how you want to spend your extra seven and a half minutes .
and actually , since this is a tech crowd , i talk in the book about how the bible actually reminds me of the wikipedia , because it has all of these authors and editors over hundreds of years .
the first experiment — i walked around mit and i distributed six-packs of cokes in the refrigerators — these were common refrigerators for the undergrads .
( laughter ) on a 42,000 mile mountain range . great job security , but not the way to go .
this is auto-gyro jousting in malibu in the 30s .
but there &apos;s one big puzzle remaining , and this was most succinctly put to me by my primary school math teacher in tanzania , who &apos;s a wonderful scottish lady who i still stay in touch with .
but you go back to the same vent eight years later and it can be completely dead .
the camera is actually doing — just , getting all the images — is doing the edge recognition and also the color recognition and so many other small algorithms are going on inside .
you can also code to interact with the physical world around you .
so hyperscore lets you start from scratch very quickly .
but what &apos;s even more striking is what &apos;s happening at the very tippy top of the income distribution .
but it &apos;s acoustically engineered to focus the sound into the house and back to the stage . and here &apos;s an acoustic shelf .
do you know , in some states across america you need less identification to open up a company than you do to get a library card , like delaware , which is one of the easiest places in the world to set up an anonymous company .
all this is being recorded on her time log .
you might think that that &apos;s not a surprise .
( sighs ) ( laughter ) do you have a preference ? ( laughter )
it was an amazing feat .
this is a very unusual teacher who was a kindergarten and first-grade teacher , but was a natural mathematician .
i still remember this decisive moment .
your cat wants more food .
now , we like to think that technology creates jobs over a period of time after a short , temporary period of dislocation , and that is true for the frame of reference with which we all live , the industrial revolution , because that &apos;s precisely what happened .
so at stanford , we created this haptic edge display , which is a mobile device with an array of linear actuators that can change shape , so you can feel in your hand where you are as you &apos;re reading a book .
now each company handles it different ways .
girl 8 : well , sometimes there is a lot of stuff going on because i have music lessons and i &apos;m on swim team — all this different stuff that i have to do , and sometimes it gets overwhelming .
these plants occur in great diversity , over 28,000 species around the world .
he said a just society is a society that if you knew everything about it , you would be willing to enter it in a random place .
just a few moments .
but because the robots interact with each other , they sense their neighbors , they essentially follow .
notice those red marks .
so what i actually get , based on this lovely , smooth , desired force , is a very noisy version .
that &apos;s a lot more than conventional science has done .
and this links up with a lot of the other ideas that have been talked about .
so all these factors , and many more besides , we don &apos;t even fully understand some of them yet , these came together to defeat a monstrosity as big as bin ladenism , the global jihad , you needed this group effort .
now archie was a doctor , so he hung around with doctors a lot .
it &apos;s about understanding that people really don &apos;t want handouts , that they want to make their own decisions ; they want to solve their own problems ; and that by engaging with them , not only do we create much more dignity for them , but for us as well .
so , they did their work with kittens , with different kinds of deprivation regiments , and those studies , which date back to the &apos; 60s , are now being applied to human children .
and so they give us , through their dna , this precise model and measure of how to date and time these ancient geological events .
it used to be kind of two to one . now , humans are catching up .
and taking that into the world of climate change — which is , frankly , the mt . everest of all problems — just because we &apos;ve lived the way we have lived for so long , just because we have consumed the way we have for so long and populated the earth the way we have for so long , doesn &apos;t mean that we can carry on the way we are carrying on .
if you &apos;re seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles , some black circles , there &apos;s another way of seeing it .
so , i hope you &apos;ll turn this conference into that kind of movement forward .
it came out of the university of washington in seattle .
here &apos;s a building at oberlin college we designed that makes more energy than it needs to operate and purifies its own water .
first of all , you are not getting clips like that about four in the afternoon .
all those colors are ice and it goes up to about two miles thick , just a gigantic dome that comes in from the coast and rises in the middle .
that &apos;s kind of what it &apos;s like .
we think there &apos;s on the order — visible to the hubble space telescope , if you had the time to scan it around — about 100 billion galaxies . right ?
this sculpture is , of course , at the heart of all of it , and it &apos;s really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars .
i want that to happen .
but for that distinction between how things consciously seem and how they really are , you can &apos;t make that distinction for the very existence of consciousness , because where the very existence of consciousness is concerned , if it consciously seems to you that you are conscious , you are conscious .
you can see here , sometimes we needed something specific reflected in his eyes — usually eve .
it will not come from radio signals .
the degree of integrity that each of us can bring to the surface , to bring to this question , the depth of character that we can summon , as we show up for the question of how do we change — it &apos;s already defining us as individuals and as a nation , and it will continue to do that , on into the future .
let &apos;s use the market as the best listening device we have , and understand at what price people would pay for this , so they get the dignity of choice .
we then found corals that are of an intermediate age , and they show us that the ocean mixed partway through that climate transition .
cc : yeah . now pick the swing beat , and do the same thing . one , two , one , two , a-one-two-three-four . yeah . mm . one-two-three , one-two-three , one-two-three , one-two-three . whoo . so i want to take the second line beat and the swing beat and put them together ,
so many diseases were once thought of as psychological until science uncovered their biological mechanisms .
compare them to the tools our ancestors used ; they bear a striking resemblance to kanzi &apos;s .
my little seven-year-old picasso dreams were crushed .
how do you describe that ?
so this is just an example of what can happen when you bring the community together towards a common goal .
be relaxed .
several long-term studies have shown that girls who diet in their early teenage years are three times more likely to become overweight five years later , even if they started at a normal weight , and all of these studies found that the same factors that predicted weight gain also predicted the development of eating disorders .
he said , well , entropy increases because there are many , many more ways for the universe to be high entropy , rather than low entropy .
there was no cooked food .
but if this can happen in tasmanian devils , why hasn &apos;t it happened in other animals or even humans ?
they met when they all had small children , through a parenting class at a family resource center in san francisco .
&quot; well , &quot; he said , &quot; i once went 60 in a 40 . &quot;
she was sitting with someone who i presume was her mother , and they were talking about the novel , &quot; &quot; dune . &quot; &quot; they were both big fans , mother and daughter — very unusual .
how do you reconcile that ?
the internet is home to two billion people , or 30 percent of the world &apos;s population .
so , i think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit , a spirit that &apos;s been crushed doesn &apos;t have hope , it doesn &apos;t see beauty , it no longer has our natural , childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine .
the reality is that many white americans are affable and kind .
so we &apos;re going to make more of them .
it really is microsoft &apos;s office . it &apos;s adobe &apos;s photoshop .
and by the evening of that day , 70 children were all browsing .
now edward de bono argued that our brains are pattern matching machines .
but what if cats are hidden ?
so , i &apos;m curious about what &apos;s going to happen in the next 5,000 days .
you have to , of course , be aware of the needs of others , but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life and be of help to people .
would you rather be c or d ?
now i want to take you into the caldera .
but within 10 minutes , my father came outside , grabbed me by my forearm and led me into our room with an unfamiliar grip .
it is a tool to reimagine a world where black people are free to exist , free to live .
but what i have to do now , feeling again , what i &apos;ve got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzymes , of these triggers into something early on in the process , that you pick it up , not through your thinking , but through your feeling .
and not relating to people starts at a very early age .
and we &apos;ve also been trying to get computers out to the world , so that groups can communicate much more effectively , campaign much more effectively , but now we have the wonderful possibility , which is given to us from the mobile phone with the camera in it , because that is cheap ; it &apos;s ubiquitous ; and it &apos;s moving fast all around the world — and it &apos;s very exciting for us .
and just — i want him to understand what happens if she stays here .
leandro is an amazing guy in a slum in rio , and he created a recycling project in the slum .
and ultimately , because you can do this for the individual , we could even see this moving to the point where the ability to develop and test medicines will be you on a chip , what we &apos;re trying to say here is the individualizing of the process of developing drugs and testing their safety .
i saw one study that compared women in nigeria , one of the most chaotic and violent and corrupt and poorest countries in africa , to women in north america .
( laughter ) hp : ( in chinese ) yr : the only problem with masking it with chinese mandarin is i can only speak this paragraph , which i have learned by heart when i was visiting in china . ( laughter ) so all i can do is keep repeating it in different tones and hope you won &apos;t notice . ( laughter ) hp : ( in chinese ) ( laughter )
now , i think , in fact , we &apos;re at a turning point in human history , where we can finally now rebuild many of the institutions of the industrial age around a new set of principles .
yes , you can , and i &apos;ll show you in a second how to do that .
as isolated as these areas are , let me show you how the outside world is crowding in .
they said his head was up in space and they would bring him down to earth , essentially he came from nothing and that is what he was worth , he ’ d never get to go to university to learn , only degrees he ’ d ever show would be the first degree burns from those that came too close , they told him he was too bright , that ’ s why no one ever looked him in the eyes , his judgment became clouded so did the sky , with evaporated tears as the sun started to cry .
how do you try to get a handle on extraterrestrial life ?
that &apos;s how physics works : a single measurement can put us on the road to a new understanding of the universe or it can send us down a blind alley .
according to freedom house , the number of democracies went from 45 in 1970 to 115 in 2010 .
they put all their heads together and they decided that there was nothing that could be done for this surgeon who had essentially separated himself from the world , who by that time had become so overwhelmed , not just with depression and feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy , but with obsessional thinking , obsessional thinking about coincidences .
if you look at this picture , what you will see is a lot of dark with some light objects in it .
but i &apos;ve also , over the last year or so , got in touch with my inner tortoise .
as you see here , we had to develop a special rig to bring the scanner up close and personal .
this is the other context .
because what would happen if all of these individual so-called choices to have babies started to turn into individual choices not to have babies .
so there &apos;s a clear message : whether you care about a fundamental , basic research of really interesting , bizarre , wonderful animals , or you want to build a search-and-rescue robot that can help you in an earthquake , or to save someone in a fire , or you care about medicine , we must preserve nature &apos;s designs .
we thought this was emotion and we thought maybe emotions were transplanted with the heart . nope .
with a sample size of just one child , no matter how much we love her , you don &apos;t really have enough of a sample size to figure out what happens on average , but at two years old , she hasn &apos;t had an ear infection yet , so we &apos;re keeping our fingers crossed on that one .
i knew we &apos;d kick ass in the war with the leviathan force .
( laughter ) ks : now , the interesting thing about this is , you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to appreciate why a 10-foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting . ( laughter )
they harass you , right ? they call you , they say , &quot; &quot; i want to see your grades . how &apos;d you do on that last test ?
they can also choose not to do that , but those that go down that road may end up in a similar situation the wright brothers ended up with early last century , facing forcible measures by government . so they &apos;d better jump now .
we are all beginning to build technology that will enable us to return to the humanity that brought us where we are today — technology that will let us stop living inside this 2d world of monitors and pixels , and let us start remembering what it feels like to live in our 3d world .
we did it with 150 combat casualties in six weeks .
he &apos;s not greedy . he doesn &apos;t see skin color .
we ended up with 11 oscar nominations for these films .
i &apos;m saving you some brain activity , because you don &apos;t need to use your hair detector cells .
and i &apos;d like to run through a few of these today .
they &apos;re not under any illusions about what &apos;s happening .
it &apos;s really hard , but in essence , nerves from the brain go up into the nose and on these nerves exposed in the nose to the outside air are receptors , and odor molecules coming in on a sniff interact with these receptors , and if they bond , they send the nerve a signal which goes back into the brain .
and some of the largest projects in the country were being constructed through government-to-government arrangements with some of the leading countries in the world , the united states and britain and france and so on and so on .
three weeks later , i was healed , and i was back in high school .
ying solved this problem by insisting that all bows and arrows were designed identically , so they were interchangeable .
virtually all of you could , right ?
in north idaho , in my red pickup truck , i kept a notepad .
they are actually making urine .
so this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing at least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye .
with the siege on gaza , tunnels brought people all the basic needs like food , building material , other stuff we needed .
and before long , i was commuting between budapest , milan and florence .
you know what today &apos;s leadership is doing ? concave length .
and that worthy ambition became his lodestar .
i mean , think about how much we love this .
at five minutes to six in the afternoon , we come together at the natural history museum in rotterdam , the duck comes out of the museum , and we try to discuss new ways to prevent birds from colliding with windows .
when you go to the exhibition , you &apos;ll see the mermaid and the pool .
they had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments .
it &apos;s not different , it &apos;s the same stuff : calcium carbonate , calcium carbonate .
it &apos;s a very great honor for me to welcome onstage one of the greatest brazilian musicians of all time .
okay , see ? it &apos;s done . it &apos;s almost done . here we go .
you need more .
and they had just come down from the high pastures , at 18,000 feet .
do you think the world is going to be a better place next year ?
on the side here , this is temporal cortex .
i don &apos;t have time to explain it , but it has to do with dna and rna .
and it was really moving . and this picture here was taken the final night from a distant cliff about two miles away , where the contents of the capsule were being beamed into space .
and he whipped out his cellphone , dialed the number , and a voice said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m up here . &quot; &quot; and right on top of the nearest coconut tree , with a hatchet in one hand and a cell phone in the other , was a local toddy tapper , who proceeded to bring down the coconuts for us to drink .
the openings are letting the hot air out and light in .
you can make a biocensor out of yeast to detect pollutants in water .
alpha is the distribution of the sizes of attacks , which is really the distribution of the group strength carrying out the attacks .
and quite often we sit in a design meeting and we discover that there is this great idea .
and it is an awesome thing to be a part of empowering someone in this way .
and when you &apos;ve got that , you &apos;ve pretty much sacrificed any hope of making lots of money .
so you can look at that piece , but you can look at the other pieces too .
when we first put the mouse into this box , it &apos;s exploring , sniffing around , walking around , minding its own business , because actually by nature , mice are pretty curious animals .
now , all of the women , or most of the women in vermeer &apos;s other paintings wore velvet , silk , fur , very sumptuous materials .
but i think that it &apos;s quite interesting to know that there is really mathematical evidence to say that you should never let the sun go down on your anger .
there is jeopardy , and of course , the closer you get , it gets harder .
but they have other communication signals they use .
and here is the fruition of that in actuality .
and michael fleischman was another ph.d. student in my lab who worked with me on this home video analysis , and he made the following observation : that &quot; &quot; just the way that we &apos;re analyzing how language connects to events which provide common ground for language , that same idea we can take out of your home , deb , and we can apply it to the world of public media . &quot; &quot; and so our effort took an unexpected turn .
for the most basic , most common , most frustrating part of being a patient .
it ’ s a neural system that ’ s wired up to reward the brain for doing a grubby clerical job .
if you remember that bald guy , you &apos;ll know that what has been stripped off of these trunks in the pacific northwest old-growth forest is going to take decades and decades to come back .
it &apos;s happening to me , i know that &apos;s right .
once upon a time there &apos;s this happy little bacterium .
and then we stuck them under the steps .
i still had migraine headaches .
government institutions were completely decapitated , including the presidential palace .
( laughter ) it &apos;s really cool .
and i thought up a lot of ideas .
and my daughter — oh , surely she is extra-intelligent . &quot; &quot; and so on . so i suddenly figured that , how come all the rich people are having these extraordinarily gifted children ?
and i think it &apos;s because of what i &apos;m hearing today in ted talks .
it is to explain death to a child , and it deserves a piece of plain-song music . &quot; &quot; and my blood froze when i read that because i had written the plain-song music 130 years after he &apos;d written the letter .
if you do this , you surely will hit somewhere near the center .
and then when i got home , i sat down and i set myself to task to really try to create something just completely outside of the box .
and we lobbied on behalf of women &apos;s issues .
at dec , i worked on software for the new area of computerized typesetting .
and we &apos;ve seen that repeatedly through this conference , not just this year , but in past years .
so at the age of 14 my father had to work .
and the one thing i &apos;d like to point out here is that we &apos;ve done this before .
if they could do it for them , surely they could do it for me .
several scientific studies have shown that abnormal microrna expression levels varies and creates a unique , specific pattern for each type of cancer , even at the early stages , reflecting the progression of the disease , and whether it &apos;s responding to medication or in remission , making micrornas a perfect , highly sensitive biomarker .
( applause )
( applause ) i want to talk to you a little bit about user-generated content .
she had a spina bifida defect , a spinal cord abnormality .
and what kind of things were people talking about ?
eventually , though , paul thinks that she just figured that he was never going to survive .
you press start , nobody touches anything , and it can reach its destination fully autonomously .
( laughter ) i did that for two reasons .
our relationship is still important .
i &apos;m palestinian , muslim , i &apos;m female , i &apos;m disabled , and i live in new jersey .
in germany , scientists are starting to find evidence of autoimmunity , and in japan , of brain inflammation .
china &apos;s highest ruling body , the politburo , has 25 members .
but the most important thing we must do is , i think , we must all walk to the end of our lives and turn around , and ask ourselves a most fundamental question .
these ideas probably remind you of &quot; &quot; total recall , &quot; &quot; &quot; eternal sunshine of the spotless mind , &quot; or of &quot; &quot; inception . &quot; &quot; but the movie stars that we work with are the celebrities of the lab .
but it was interesting because i had some very preconceived notions about , for instance , evangelical christianity , and i found that it &apos;s such a wide and varied movement that it is difficult to make generalizations about it .
from astronauts &apos; experiences in space , we know that spending time in a microgravity environment means bone loss , muscle atrophy , cardiovascular problems , among many other complications that range for the physiological to the psychological .
so in other words , while our vascular system uses the three dimensions inside us , our urban transportation is mostly two-dimensional .
so i &apos;m on a mission to change that .
the first day they all came back .
but he doesn &apos;t know whether it &apos;s an infection , whether it &apos;s to do with malnutrition .
it &apos;s got an amazing user experience .
so inside our country , we are a net carbon sink .
this is my first trip , first time in life i &apos;m outside of the walls of gaza .
the monarch butterfly could be one of the 20 to 50 percent of all species that the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates will be ticketed for extinction by the end of the century if we stay on business-as-usual fossil fuel use .
but in the mean time , i &apos;m going to call on the worldwide education expert , who &apos;s my 10-year-old daughter , noa , to talk to you about why the boys in her class do worse .
which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice overload problem , which is concretization .
does it have to take a tragedy or a disaster for us to feel deeply connected as one species , as human beings ?
you were sleeping during that class .
who decides what reality is ?
and when the resources came , be it oil , we started building these fancy technologies and bringing people together because we needed the concentration .
then i ran 50 miles — ultramarathons .
another called maidsafe works on similar principles .
and she does really good business . in fact , i watched her walk through the streets hawking . and before you knew it , there was a crowd of women around her , buying these dresses .
on the top , now , that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through — the dotted line , the temperatures .
someone put up all the wikileaked cables from the state department , along with software used to interpret them , including my favorite use ever of the cablegate cables , which is a tool for detecting naturally occurring haiku in state department prose .
we &apos;re ready because we &apos;ve seen , in the financial crisis of 2008 , how our fetish for economic growth led us so far astray .
so you start with the personalized data where the speed limit on the road that you are at that point is 25 , and , of course , you &apos;re going faster than that .
ten years ago , on a tuesday morning , i conducted a parachute jump at fort bragg , north carolina .
well it means growing an actual heart , let &apos;s say , or grow a piece of bone that can be put into the body .
it &apos;s kind of like genomics .
they can detect credit card fraud and block spam and they can translate between languages .
the dot is visible whenever a cell fires an electrical impulse .
well , let me give you a demonstration of about 200 instruments we &apos;ve created so far for the laptop orchestra .
but i &apos;ve done more in the seven decades since that miserable day when my mother put me on the train than i would ever have dreamed possible .
i was a young australian woman doing extraordinary things in london .
and i realized that , when i &apos;d left the country , free and fair elections in a democratic environment were a dream .
so the best place for x-ray crystallography was at the cavendish laboratory at cambridge .
we might not ever know .
oh , look how it lies there .
mm : the medium does things to people and they are always completely unaware of this .
shit offends people . feces is too medical .
so , how do they do that ?
what they &apos;ve done is they &apos;ve shifted their operations .
thank you .
interestingly enough , an example : one young man who earned a c in the first course and wanted to go on to med school , we said , &quot; &quot; we need to have you retake the course , because you need a strong foundation if you &apos;re going to move to the next level . &quot; &quot; every foundation makes the difference in the next level .
but then one night , my mom was cooking grilled chicken for dinner , and i noticed that the edges of the chicken , which had been marinated in lemon juice , turned white .
we &apos;ve observed that the process of art therapy bypasses the speech-language issue with the brain .
hp : thank you . ( applause )
and the then-communications minister replied in a lordly manner that in a developing country communications are a luxury , not a right , that the government had no obligation to provide better service , and if the honorable member wasn &apos;t satisfied with his telephone , could he please return it , since there was an eight-year-long waiting list for telephones in india .
there was a great story of some little girl who they saved from leukemia by taking the blood out , editing it , and putting it back with a precursor of crispr .
i was one of the only kids in college who had a reason to go to the p.o. box at the end of the day , and that was mainly because my mother has never believed in email , in facebook , in texting or cell phones in general .
banking hasn &apos;t always been the way we read about it now in the newspapers .
or the man who decides that he is going to take his life , uses facebook as a way to say goodbye to friends and family .
now , let me ask you another question .
&quot; limpia &quot; means &quot; clean , &quot; because we want to empower and we want to inspire citizens .
language must have been useful for the genes .
and our work doesn &apos;t really resolve itself into a body in any way at all .
now smule &apos;s mission is to create expressive , mobile music things , and one of the first musical instruments we created is called ocarina .
it &apos;s a mystery .
children don &apos;t like it .
and then leilei — i know his other name — told us about interconnection , and how we &apos;re all totally interconnected here , and how we &apos;ve all known each other . and of course in the buddhist universe , we &apos;ve already done this already billions of times in many , many lifetimes in the past .
but the effect is relatively small .
so that &apos;s why the petitioner , the victims , the peasants , want to take the train to beijing to petition to the central government , they want the emperor to settle the problem .
they will enable compelling new concepts in how we design cities , work , and the way we live .
when play is about building a tower out of blocks , the kid begins to learn a lot about towers .
( laughter ) now how would you feel about handing your phone over ?
and what &apos;s happening here , this is where you &apos;ve actually elected to join that nike community . you &apos;ve bought into it .
person with the goods , person with the money , because they can &apos;t trust each other , are not going to exchange .
find the truth for yourself , and when you find the truth for yourself , there will be a truth in it , but it may contradict the plot , but don &apos;t worry about it . &quot; &quot; so , the sequel to &quot; &quot; elizabeth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; golden age . &quot; &quot; when i made the sequel to &quot; &quot; elizabeth , &quot; &quot; here was a story that the writer was telling : a woman who was threatened by philip ii and was going to war , and was going to war , fell in love with walter raleigh .
it takes really a lot of time and it &apos;s expensive to train the operator to operate this complex arm .
add on pandemic threat , you &apos;re in big trouble .
and i didn &apos;t know exactly why i had it , but it was so vivid .
and i thought , well , henry viii , okay .
and she &apos;s already at the nano .
did you touch it ?
boltzmann explained that if you start with low entropy , it &apos;s very natural for it to increase because there &apos;s more ways to be high entropy .
be a mentor .
es : i can see you . ( laughter ) ca : and who goes with the second choice , the fundamentally heroic act ?
when i enter into dialogue , i really hope that the other side would pick up my points of view , that i would impress upon them my opinions and my values .
so you imagine , if we &apos;re able to create a self-sustaining artificial life form , not only will this tell us about the origin of life — that it &apos;s possible that the universe doesn &apos;t need carbon to be alive ; it can use anything — we can then take &#91; it &#93; one step further and develop new technologies , because we can then use software control for evolution to code in .
now if i graph , for instance , some other technology , say transportation technology , on a semi-log curve , it would look very stupid , it would look like a flat line .
you can make objective claims about a domain that is subjective in its mode of existence , and indeed that &apos;s what neurologists do .
so nowadays in the operating room , we no longer need to use sunlight .
when you actually look at the motor of the world economy , it cannot move forward unless there is trade between the different countries .
remember that image from the beginning ?
ca : and then the only recourse is some form of forced migration .
using a grid the size of your thumb , with 32 electrodes on the surface of his brain , tim uses his thoughts to control an advanced prosthetic arm .
i remember thinking , my friend could have explained that entire experiment with a dance .
that means that by the age of five , you can &apos;t see as well for the rest of your life .
children are not adults .
light comes through , it bounces back off the layers ; it &apos;s called thin-film interference . imagine being able to self-assemble products with the last few layers playing with light to create color .
only months later , i discover who he really was .
there &apos;s other ways of making flaps .
richard dawkins : &quot; &quot; we &apos;ve evolved around courtship and sex , are attached to deep-rooted emotions and reactions that are hard to jettison overnight . &quot; &quot; david pizarro : so my favorite part of this clip is that professor dawkins actually gagged .
after a while , i got a bit — i wanted to go somewhere else .
i am going to tell you how i do it and the most important thing i &apos;ve learned .
i have no idea how that works . we &apos;ll send that over there .
with those three systems , you have what is always necessary — a level of redundancy that says , if one system fails , you &apos;ll still have a way to make sure that you &apos;re being controlled .
and the very best of luck to you .
and as the sandstone weathers , new grains break free .
but he experiences himself , his thoughts and feelings , as something separate from the rest ...
but some of you might not know that the arm itself can actually regenerate a complete starfish .
we got a survey done on medical conditions with people who have similar issues , and i look at medical records , and i say , wouldn &apos;t it be amazing if everyone &apos;s medical records were available anonymously to research doctors ?
the year is 2005 .
somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles .
the world that meant a lot to me , i saw it vanish in my face .
kallikuppam had caught up with my control school in new delhi , a rich private school with a trained biotechnology teacher .
he was a very selfish meme .
on average , there &apos;s one within 20 to 30 miles of wherever you are in the united states .
the employment in the rich countries will go down from about 800 to about 700 million of these people .
but in order to try and explain the whole thing , i would need another 18 minutes or so to do it , so you &apos;re just going to have to take it on trust from me on this occasion , and let me assure you that all of these issues are involved in cybersecurity and control of the internet one way or the other , but in a configuration that even stephen hawking would probably have difficulty trying to get his head around .
now if we look forward a bit to the 19th century , we find a new style of technology .
( laughter ) voice : look at my smile .
she still made the two-hour trek to the schoolhouse and tried to catch every little bit of information that seeped out of the doors .
pope francis , who has made such a difference to this whole issue , visited tacloban right after that .
so we better find out what the target is soon . &quot; &quot; so we extracted and decompiled the attack code , and we discovered that it &apos;s structured in two digital bombs — a smaller one and a bigger one .
people &apos;s states of their own body changed how they perceived the environment .
that &apos;s what happens to me . it kind of ruins my whole week , because whatever i &apos;ve got planned that week is kind of out the window .
there was just no future .
and many advances now , we can do that fairly readily .
there &apos;s 7.3 billion people in the world today ; there will be 9.6 billion by 2050 .
and humans dispersed — not once , but twice .
i don &apos;t think so .
the government recently announced plans to return to the moon by 2024 .
and so immediately as you meet people , you shake their hand , and then your eyes go to their shoulder , because you want to see where did they serve , or what unit did they serve with ?
i met humble people .
now , i get to the final thing , which is the set of which my name is attached .
the second stage was completed at the penn state university main campus lab , which is where i extracted the chemicals , changed the ph so i could run it through the equipment and separated the compounds i needed from the rest of the chicken .
and then when rockefeller center said , nbc , could you put this thing up on the walls ? we were delighted .
but the most surprising part was when we turned to , what are we going to work on in the week ahead ?
so what we did was put all the instructions online as open source .
health studies from the region are conflicting and fraught .
therefore , they asked their parents to go down to the streets and collect them , bring them back home .
and , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time .
( laughter ) this was a fun one .
those are their expectations of who you are , not yours .
( laughter ) don &apos;t go asking for a frappuccino there .
it doesn &apos;t , i agree , look very much .
i &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; wow , that was great — ( laughter ) — please lady , don &apos;t say another word . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and the camera is down at her , and this guy has to put the microphone in her face , said , &quot; &quot; what do you mean by that ? &quot; &quot; and i figured , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all over now , &quot; &quot; and she looks up and she says , &quot; &quot; well , &quot; &quot; she &apos;s still watching these guys go ; she says , &quot; &quot; i can &apos;t ride a bike , &quot; &quot; no , she says , &quot; &quot; i can &apos;t use a skateboard , and i &apos;ve never used roller blades , &quot; &quot; she knew them by name ; she says , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s been 50 years since i rode a bicycle . &quot; &quot; then she looks up , she &apos;s looking up , and she says ,
when we originally looked at bringing civil actions against terrorists , everyone thought we were a bit mad and mavericks and crackpots . now it &apos;s got a title . everyone &apos;s doing it .
i make the dove appear .
there &apos;s a bit of randomness here too because , when i was beginning independent diplomat , i went to a party in the house of lords , which is a ridiculous place , but i was holding my drink like this , and i bumped into this guy who was standing behind me .
and so many opportunities get missed when that happens .
( laughter ) which tells you something about our place in the universe .
why strangeness ? because our social relations are increasingly mediated by data , and data turns our social relations into digital relations , and that means that our digital relations now depend extraordinarily on technology to bring to them a sense of robustness , a sense of discovery , a sense of surprise and unpredictability .
most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day .
and i &apos;m grateful .
here &apos;s the idea .
what about global politics ?
the only thing that they don &apos;t have is access to resources . they don &apos;t even have a textbook sometimes , and they don &apos;t even have a proper curriculum .
so , there &apos;s going to be a tremendous struggle .
sughar is a local word used in many , many languages in pakistan .
and by seven minutes and 30 seconds , they had to pull my body out and bring me back .
the same is true every time as i started thinking about information .
vertically , you have the time .
i taped my aunt . i taped my aunt singing a song in russian from the — you know , could we have it for a second ?
the shipping lanes have been moved .
ag : that &apos;s right .
you &apos;re literally in your own world .
so there &apos;s some problem with these metrics now .
so this is what we hope to do in the next few years .
and some people will get people to be on the other team .
she &apos;s carrying all the weight through harnesses .
i can &apos;t wait to find out what it looks like .
&quot; &quot; pickpocket &quot; &quot; started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement .
so the smell of vanilla , that might change the four on the left to brown and the one on the right to yellow . this matrix can produce thousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells .
i have a wonderful visit to facebook hq coming up .
( applause ) so let me tell you a little bit how this was done .
because when we looked at the four platforms around the site , one of which is an upgrade of the families &apos; platform , we knew that these had to be moveable to respond to changing conditions , and the changing definition of what ground zero is .
and that &apos;s the difference between problems that are additive , like co2 , which we go slowly up and then we tip , and problems that are depletive , in which we lose what we have , which oscillate , and they oscillate until we lose everything we &apos;ve got .
but i think that glamour actually has a much broader meaning — one that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters , but also comes in other forms .
for myself , i tried to get away from infectious diseases , and i didn &apos;t .
let &apos;s start here .
and that led to all kinds of things , from being in curricula in universities and schools to — one of my favorite pictures i have from south asia , it was a couple of men with long beards and a lot of girls wearing the hijab — it looked like a school .
there was shared attention looking at the same sort of thing , and recognizing socially communicated reinforcement at the end .
and all of the data , we aligned based on the following idea : every time my son would learn a word , we would trace back and look at all of the language he heard that contained that word .
here &apos;s a question that matters .
one way of thinking about it is to imagine what it would be like if language — where it could only be used literally .
and so does every wild habitat on the planet , like the amazon rainforest you &apos;re hearing behind me .
what we can measure is that tangible stuff at the bottom of the pyramid .
and , so now , when the polar ice caps melt , my recording studio will rise up like an ark , and i &apos;ll float off into the drowned world like a character from a j.g. ballard novel .
the more stress , the less brain development , which in turn causes less adaptability and causes higher stress levels .
why do many people believe that india is still a growth disaster ?
then we can actually see that what started out as just straight lines is actually a curve called a parabola .
we have to have treatment centers , specialized ebola treatment centers , where the workers can be protected as they try to provide support to the people who are infected , so that they might survive the disease .
at the present time , my collaborators and i , what we &apos;re aiming for is much more modest — just to find partial connectomes of tiny chunks of mouse and human brain .
probably the largest urban-renewal project , i think , ever attempted on the planet .
( applause )
this was taken in the riviera sugar factory in red hook , brooklyn .
john mccain .
and that i do .
the words &quot; &quot; water &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; dry &quot; &quot; do not match , right ?
and then he got so excited , he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better , and the giant didn &apos;t run away , so he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible , bringing a creature of legend from the misty history into high-resolution video .
his father was an sob , and , in fact , he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood , but then we were off and running .
you know , she was very chic , but she was very filled with ennui , you know .
and every now and then , find a friend , find a turtle , and take a long , slow walk .
they comment on politics , they cry out against the evils of congress .
so this was how the finished shot appeared in the film .
because by definition , news is something that almost never happens .
well , as a synonym , they often use ambiences .
all of origami comes from that .

but i &apos;m also happy and honored to be up here and i think that it &apos;s great that i got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and i &apos;d had more agency in my career , because maybe then i wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how i got my first job , or maybe i wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how i paid for college , which seems so important right now .
av : we , or i ?
you &apos;re saying hey , you know , i don &apos;t think i &apos;m going to need them , so i &apos;m just going to trust that , you know , let &apos;s get rid of them , it doesn &apos;t really matter , these guys are going to do the right thing .

and so i &apos;m so excited to discuss this with them , and i come in and i say , &quot; &quot; can somebody please explain the main ideas and why this is so cool ? &quot; &quot; there &apos;s silence .
well , i think what part of the problem is that , in haiti , although the problem is huge , somehow we understand it , it &apos;s localized .
proximate self-similarity . and that accounts for this phenomenon .
it &apos;s a different way of thinking about it , but i think it &apos;s kind of beautiful , because it is certainly far more inclusive than the us-versus-them or the abled-versus-the-disabled , and it &apos;s a lot more honest and respectful of the fragility of life .

i graduated high school in may , and — ( laughter ) ( applause ) — i graduated high school in may , and i decided that i was going to start up a company to commercialize these technologies that i &apos;ve developed , these revolutionary detectors for scanning cargo containers and these systems to produce medical isotopes , but i want to do this , and i &apos;ve slowly been building up a team of some of the most incredible people i &apos;ve ever had the chance to work with , and i &apos;m really prepared to make this a reality .
this uses 20 times less energy for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car , which means not only is this thing fast to charge and really cheap to build , but it also reduces the footprint of your energy use in terms of your transportation .

pew research did a study of 10,000 american adults , and they found that at this moment , we are more polarized , we are more divided , than we ever have been in history .
that code looks pretty much like all the other code on that system .
but i didn &apos;t get it .
i became obsessed with the object — not just the beautiful photograph itself , and the color , the shallow depth of field , the detail that &apos;s visible , the wire you can see on the beak there that the conservator used to put this skeleton together — there &apos;s an entire story here .

how much is your field talking to great marketers about their insights into human psychology ?
so , it &apos;s a full range of facial expressions simulating all the major muscles in the human face , running on very small batteries , extremely lightweight .
like i &apos;ll read that one of the two attributes of matter in the newtonian universe — there are two attributes of matter in the newtonian universe — one is space occupancy . matter takes up space .
i &apos;m talking here a little bit about display technologies .
most of them explode spontaneously in contact with air , and when you call up the companies , they only give you minimum ten tons , ok ?

( applause ) it &apos;s nothing we had to do about this .
this is the muktuk , or the blubber , all lined up for community distribution .

and another man looked in my direction and said , &quot; yes , there he is . he &apos;s on this elevator with us . &quot;
now , the commodity exchange itself , that concept , is not new to the world .
he said , &quot; &quot; if i keep tossing myself off i get fresh sperm being made . &quot; &quot; which i thought was an interesting idea , theory .
so out of all these planets out there , and the variety is just simply astonishing , we mostly want to find the planets that are goldilocks planets , we call them .
and i would like you to join with all of humanity to draw a line in the sand and say , &quot; &quot; no more .
and i might add , by the way , over half of us are women .

in gando , there was no electricity , no access to clean drinking water , and no school .
so the myth here is that the left brain is logical , it &apos;s good with equations like this , and the right brain is more creative , so the right brain is better at music .
it blows my mind away that we can now quantify something as personal as our emotions , and we can do it at this scale .
now this is not something that &apos;s ready for the public , but it is in working progress .
our cultural imagination about compassion has been deadened by idealistic images .
and for this reason , they were deeply disturbed , deeply alarmed and the entire epidemic was unraveling in front of them .

we brought musicians to the canopy , and they made their music — and it &apos;s fantastic music .
( applause ) ls : let me show you the experimental results .
i didn &apos;t have to try to flap my wings .
we have thousands and thousands of european fighters in syria and in iraq , so this is not something that you solve by just not allowing syrians to come in .
just as we can &apos;t predict what one molecule in a gas will do — it &apos;s hopeless to predict a single molecule — yet we can predict the properties of the whole gas , using thermodynamics , very accurately .
lp : well , i think for me , this is kind of one of the most exciting things i &apos;ve seen in a long time .

not just translate them , but interpret them .
( sa : customizable for the boss of your choice . ) dk : and of course : a hammock for your afternoon nap that stretches across your cubicle .
it &apos;s called momentum .
and now string theory comes along and says , yes , gravity , quantum mechanics , electromagnetism , all together in one package , but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see .
so it was not easy at all .
so i &apos;m going to show you a few examples of what we can do .
( laughter ) so let me tell you what aroused such irate responses , and i &apos;ll let you decide if whether they — the claims are really that outrageous .
now i don &apos;t mean extra gills or something — something we care about , like aging .
they did not get me any closer to understanding why i thought i recognized this one particular poem .
consider the memory of long temporal sequences of movements , like a pianist playing a beethoven sonata .
we homo sapiens are the only species we know of that is driven to scientific inquiry .

ta-da !
this is the work i made out of that material .
the european union ets is the main marketplace .

the frequent furl of five fingers , the chips in my teeth come from biting at all the many things a solitary hand cannot open .
it just sucked me in immediately , as if i began preparing myself as a patient to die according to the schedule that they had just given to me , until i met a patient named verna in a waiting room , who became a dear friend , and she grabbed me one day and took me off to the medical library and did a bunch of research on these diagnoses and these diseases , and said , &quot; &quot; eric , these people who get this are normally in their &apos; 70s and &apos; 80s .
so there you go . my name is john hodgman .
momentum was being built .
a couple years later , my dad took me to a film called &quot; &quot; excalibur . &quot; &quot; i actually got him to take me to it twice , which is no small thing , because it is a hard , r-rated film .
hollow organs have a much higher degree of complexity , because you &apos;re asking these organs to act on demand .
( laughter ) now , at harvard , we learned by the case method .
even though it &apos;s earth-like , and even though early in its history it may very well have harbored earth-like life , it soon succumbed to runaway greenhouse — that &apos;s an 800 degrees &#91; fahrenheit &#93; surface — because of rampant carbon dioxide .
we &apos;ve had people pretend that this is a problem that &apos;s been fixed .
a virus grabbed onto a bacterium and it slipped its dna into it .
it &apos;s equally testable .
each camera was covering 60 degrees of his head , so that in post-production we could use pretty much any angle we needed , and we shot only his head .
i &apos;ve learned that borders are where the actual ends , but also where the imagination and the story begins .

that &apos;s all true .
this world that you &apos;re going to be talking about tomorrow is going to be completely integrated . you &apos;re not going to be a pilot , you &apos;re going to be a passenger .
and they will be able to jump right into the project and start working on it without asking anybody &apos;s permission .
that education will work better if we &apos;ve got electricity and railroads , and so on .
but they lose , right ?
but if you get the kiss in three days , well that &apos;s three days of jittery anticipation , the thrill of the wait .
so luke , you go to your communications professors — you &apos;re majoring in communications — and you ask them for permission to come to ted , which might have a little bit to do with communications , and what was their reaction ?
second , you need to reenforce integrators .
so , bad news first .
so millions of viewers are watching those episodes .
so you say to yourself , &quot; &quot; well , that &apos;s worth something . &quot; &quot; so you go back into the room , and you break this thing to pieces , and you haul it away .
a lot of experts were saying it was impossible , and my mum certainly wasn &apos;t very keen on the idea .
ok , but he &apos;s losing ground here .
and the biggest problem is that overall , they &apos;ve appropriated the largesse of the digital age asymmetrically : we have wealth creation , but we have growing social inequality .
ha ha . no , no , no .
now , about that cow model i talked about .
the blade fell , the head fell into a basket , out of sight immediately , and they called out , &quot; give me back my gallows , give me back my wooden gallows . &quot;
but the good news is that decades of development and research have led to a lot of new technologies and knowledge that allow us to do a lot better .
and second , it was not restricted to pairs of people .
( applause ) yeah , but there were hundreds of individuals , obviously , who made that a reality .
i &apos;m feeling the sonic world around me .
this is another cartoon from &quot; &quot; the rejection collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; too snug ? &quot;
but while the west has opened on sex , what we found is that arab societies appear to have been moving in the opposite direction .
we need to employ someone to glue and to screw the sole of the feet .
computers control our military equipment , everything from missile silos to satellites to nuclear defense networks .
each of those is an outcome ; you would like something to happen .
and then we grow these things , and we tell people , back in the countries where these seeds have come from , &quot; &quot; look , actually we &apos;re not just storing this to get the seeds later , but we can give you this information about how to germinate these difficult plants . &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s already happening .
and this ideagora that he created , an open market , agora , for uniquely qualified minds , was part of a change , a profound change in the deep structure and architecture of our organizations , and how we sort of orchestrate capability to innovate , to create goods and services , to engage with the rest of the world , in terms of government , how we create public value .
the worst part was this year was the year where they decided to do a big cleanup operation on mt . everest .
so during a two-hour race , each car will be sending 750 million numbers .
maybe i should get away from this map completely , and really be honest about wanting to show you my favorite bits and pieces of rome and simply kick a soccer ball in the air — which happens in so many of the squares in the city — and let it bounce off of things . and i &apos;ll simply explain what each of those things is that the soccer ball hits .
you can say , &quot; &quot; give a muffin to a mouse , &quot; &quot; the prepositional dative .
instead , our eeg scans revealed very specific problems hidden within their brains that couldn &apos;t possibly have been detected by their behavioral assessments .
i &apos;m as certain of that as i was of the success that we &apos;ve had with direct television broadcasting , sirius xm .
looking at the entire facade — there were 70 total windows — and i knew what i had to do .
so that &apos;s my point , that you can have a big effect on these kids .
and finally , well , isn &apos;t this just intuition ?
it &apos;s been missing in much of the architecture , because we think architecture is the realm of the neutered , the realm of the kind of a state that has no opinion , that has no value .
they see us as adults , rational adults .
it would be really great if you didn &apos;t let people divide the world into the creatives and the non-creatives , like it &apos;s some god-given thing , and to have people realize that they &apos;re naturally creative .
but seriously , seriously , we did get along , because we had a common goal of wanting to inspire these young people .
so i want to give a little bit of a different perspective of how we can perhaps look at these things in a little bit of a different way .
inside there , on these two opposite sides , there is the secret of translation .
what happens in one place very quickly affects everything else .
and lastly , the only portrait of a male that leonardo painted , &quot; &quot; the musician . &quot; &quot; before we go into these faces , i should explain why i have some right to talk about them .
no crows are brought up .
but really , if we &apos;re all going to be honest with ourselves , i have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with , was it .
now let &apos;s stop and think about it for a minute .
and i select &quot; &quot; it &apos;s embarrassing . &quot; &quot; and then i &apos;m encouraged to message my friend , but here &apos;s the critical difference .

and i feel like we &apos;re sort of at the point now where we need to make that choice of what kind of future we want to be living in .
jf : you spell it right out — lt : i spell it , every letter .
( laughter ) now this may be a way of saying &quot; &quot; pure beings &quot; &quot; — like in angels — or it may be like the greek kouros or kórē , an eternal youth .
that &apos;s my question .
using this technology , the specialists at ucla medical center were able to identify where that compression in the hose pipe was occurring .
things are changing and today , on the united nations statistic division home page , it says , by first of may , full access to the databases .
if you &apos;re like most people , just seeing that gave you a small sense of elation and joy — just to think about making 50 percent more money in retirement than before .

if you are a latina , we &apos;re at 54 cents .
this judge is someone you &apos;d never want to play poker with .
and looking back , he said to me that , yes , proust was right that at 22 , we are sure we will not die , just as a thanatologist named edwin shneidman was right that at 90 , we are sure we will .
31 is a prime number , and that five in the power is also a prime number .
but we take the severe ones , and we reschedule the other ones the next day .
and we actually had to install white walls to separate these pieces , which didn &apos;t belong together .
we can look at all 10 million synapses now .
this guy . who is he ? he &apos;s the critic .
in fact , no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all .

i just fell in love with the culture and the people .
no masks ...
and i &apos;m going to break it down for you for just a second .
the big challenge became actually taking the pictures through that telescope .

let &apos;s see , should we order that all pets be kept indoors ?
ca : that &apos;s not 30 percent a year , that &apos;s — ms : yes , thirty percent a year .
but they want it to be easy , affordable and attractive , and they expect business to help , and they &apos;re a little bit disappointed today .
so what does the eight-year-old do ?
and this question is really what i want to talk about today .
so i looked for furniture .
what if we reorganized this approach ?
the pictures that came a bit later had a very simple reason .
that &apos;s a huge statement on how broken the indian public education system is .
she launches this thing above the spanish steps and sets off for an aerial tour of the city .
i didn &apos;t ask you to chant it because it &apos;s true ; i just want you to remember it .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated entities offers a new palette for aesthetic expression .
we conducted months of user research overseas , trying to think like designers , human-centered design — &quot; let &apos;s figure out what people want . &quot;
and of of the criticisms is this idea of merit .
design &apos;s power of synthesis is just an attempt to put at the innermost core of architecture the force of life .
what &apos;s the population of the earth ?
the effects of personal stress and social stigmas are a deadly combination .
to do this , we extracted enzymes from our bacteria and reacted with an intermediate of phthalic acid .
and it &apos;s something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
we &apos;re sometimes contacted by people in other parts of the world who can &apos;t travel to the united states , but would like to hear this record .
now , fast-forward to today and this is what you see : the 15 million cell phones a month .
and people said , &quot; &quot; oh that &apos;s a very very large space that you &apos;re asking for . &quot; &quot; and we said , &quot; &quot; what if we had proven that in the same space we found oil for the country for the next hundred years ? &quot; &quot; and they said , &quot; &quot; we tried . there isn &apos;t any . &quot; &quot; we said , &quot; &quot; no no , but what if we prove it ? &quot; &quot; and they said , &quot; &quot; well you can dig . &quot; &quot; and we decided to dig up , instead of digging down .
but the window of opportunity was innovation and new mindset , which today has led to a completely new governance strategy to build resilience , acknowledge redundancy and invest in the whole system as an integrated whole , and then allow for much more redundancy in the system .
and then i swap it out with the students and actually re-release that carbon black .
so , tissue design .
i myself am now collecting these cool pyrex containers and using those instead of glad and tupperware containers to store food in .
but a few years ago , i noticed a disturbing trend in leadership preparation .
so , music videos are something that i always found interesting , but they always seem to be so reactive .
by the way , check out my sweet ride . ( laughter ) since birth , we have both suffered from the inability to fly on our own .
that &apos;s not true of the robot .
that &apos;s a four percent reduction per year — and this , with measuring .
now the staggering system , not just that this worked in everquest , but that today , a decade on , every single video game in the world with this kind of task uses a version of this system — tens of millions of people .
remember we used to throw things away , and we &apos;d point to away ?
luckily , there are millions and millions of geniuses willing to gift us with their best ideas .
but what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily ?
today &apos;s commercial markets worldwide , global commercial launch market ?
and importantly , those bits of dna are passed on to the cells &apos; progeny , so cells are protected from viruses not only in one generation , but over many generations of cells .
( laughter ) so — ( applause ) but what are some other tools or hacks that sound designers use ?
and there was a young girl named jaclyn .
and so , what i &apos;d like to do now is to tell you about what we &apos;ve learned in those journeys .
so i took one &quot; &quot; no &quot; &quot; off a tombstone from the islamic museum in cairo , and i added a message to it : &quot; no to military rule . &quot;
and somebody like dr. victoria hale , who started the world &apos;s first nonprofit pharmaceutical company , and whose first drug will be fighting visceral leishmaniasis , also known as black fever .
so we could either take something long and make it a topic , like with the railway and the hurtigruten , or we could take a topic and make it long .
( laughter ) this is a very different demographic .
it is simply how we protect our walls .
they &apos;ve been doing it since 1948 , and what they show consistently throughout is that it &apos;s almost impossible to find americans who are consistent ideologically , who consistently support , &quot; &quot; no we mustn &apos;t tax , and we must limit the size of government , &quot; &quot; or , &quot; &quot; no , we must encourage government to play a larger role in redistribution and correcting the ills of capitalism . &quot; &quot; those groups are very , very small .
and it &apos;s moving through us , this self-organization , and we &apos;re extending and accelerating it , and we can be part of it by aligning the technology that we make with it .
we can design new materials , new products , and new facilities .
now , being a biologist , i was very curious about this .
he now has a chain of restaurants .
and right now this is in the okavango delta in botswana .
that &apos;s good .
so , we &apos;ll click ford , and now that becomes the center .
what it &apos;s telling us is that capitalism is going to become more social .
and we think people like this probably don &apos;t want to vote for people who look like this and are named barack obama .
first of all , there &apos;s the object in the world .
from tobacco to lead poisoning to hiv / aids , the united states actually has quite a strong track record with addressing public health problems , but replicating those successes with aces and toxic stress is going to take determination and commitment , and when i look at what our nation &apos;s response has been so far , i wonder , why haven &apos;t we taken this more seriously ?
so on the subject of deception , i wanted to quote one of my favorite authors .
it &apos;s about fighting them on contemporary battlefields .
i wanted to get back where the romance was .
second , we are both responsible for and the victims of our own pollution .
now i have beaten a song back into you .
miranda : do you love me ?
it was proceeding at moore &apos;s law pace , but then in 2008 , something changed .
however , my boss always asked if i had the data to prove it would sell , and asked me to think of product development after analyzing market data .
they are our body &apos;s own repair kits , and they &apos;re pluripotent , which means they can morph into all of the cells in our bodies .
it was approaching 11 when i exited right toward afula , and passed a large quarry and was soon in kfar kara .
but if you take a lens , like that , this line is ack , ack , ack , ack , ack . like that .
so roughly five liters of air per breath , 17 breaths per minute of the 525,600 minutes per year , comes to approximately 45 million liters of air , enriched 100 times in carbon dioxide , just for you .
larry , you can explain this one .
it gives you a sense of the scale , and it doesn &apos;t look anything like the others .
now that would give you an unfair advantage . &quot; &quot; he sued , and his case went all the way to the supreme court , believe it or not , the case over the golf cart , because the law says that the disabled must be accommodated , provided the accommodation does not change the essential nature of the activity .
so we gave them some more tasks to deal with , and what we did here is we turned the world under their feet . and watch its response .
and the big goal here is to take inspiration from animals to make robots that can handle complex terrain — stairs , mountains , forests , places where robots still have difficulties and where animals can do a much better job .
( laughter ) as you can see , these are all maps .
animators had to actually animate them .
and this just came off last september at ars electronica ; we repeated it in england .
thank you .
most politicians in my country want to roll back the drug war now , put fewer people behind bars , not more , and i &apos;m proud to say as an american that we now lead the world in reforming marijuana policies .
i mean , just incredible to see bunches of gharial basking on the river again .
( applause )
we need better tools .
one billion — that &apos;s more than ever before — because of gross inequalities in distribution , not tonnage .
income there stayed stagnant , as it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world .
it &apos;s called the norden mark 15 bombsight .
they integrated with the building in really peculiar ways .
india has many because they are many .
and here we are frantically building these experiments , doing these calculations , writing these computer codes .
and this tenuous veneer around our planet is what allows life to flourish .
his story is their story .
because the social progress index also has some very good news .
it says exactly the same thing : poor kids lose ground in the summertime .
it wasn &apos;t clear .
now during the clinical trial , she &apos;d been given all her antiretroviral drugs free of charge , and her transportation costs had been covered by the research funds .
the dead zone , it turns out , is full of life .
it was less than i would pay for a bar of chocolate at home .
they were almost entirely replaced with fossil fuels , and so the consequence was that we wiped out almost as much clean energy electricity that we get from solar .
there &apos;s a whole variety of other reasons why property rights sometimes don &apos;t work in these cases , but they do need security of tenure .
and the fact that france has put food at the center of the g20 is really important .
and it won &apos;t be done .
that &apos;s very important to us .
we are missing a completely other side of wars .
but here &apos;s the problem : to catch cat fleas is difficult .
however , his chin skin doesn &apos;t look the same as it did before .
can biotechnology be used to create work as moving as music ?
at worst , they &apos;re throwaways , they &apos;re for amusement .
thank you very much .
could we use , let &apos;s say , pharmacological drugs to activate or inactivate brain cells ?
two ? so you should have sat down earlier .
inside the virtual newsroom , the reporters could gather around the themes that were emerging from the documents .
so what do you do ?
i didn &apos;t want to stand out in the crowd anymore .
look at the toxic mix of unemployed graduates on our streets , while employers say they cannot find the people with the skills they need .
i &apos;ve got something to show you .
do what you can . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so they do what they can .
and then he breathed his last , with loved ones around him , and i know that he had chicken soup also , as his last meal . &quot; &quot; i happen to know it for a fact .
there &apos;s some arduino balls collecting data and sort of measuring some parameters .
there &apos;s one last elephant in the room , the proteins themselves , which come from algae and bacteria and fungi , and all over the tree of life .
it &apos;s china , india , russia .
( applause )
now that last mile , last foot , in a sense , is the first step of the infrastructure .
and i was thinking , how many terrorists could i possibly play before turning into one myself ?
but for molecular programming , our question is , how many molecules do we need to put in that seed to get a cell phone ?
so , this is the message of desert .
we don &apos;t even need that much time to do amazing things .
and they react . they told me what is possible , what is impossible .
now , some people call her the first programmer .
now you might look at this result and say , okay , sure , on average people are less happy when they &apos;re mind-wandering , but surely when their minds are straying away from something that wasn &apos;t very enjoyable to begin with , at least then mind-wandering should be doing something good for us .
we &apos;re connecting with something important inside of us .
much better for everybody to go off by themselves , generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics , and then come together as a team to talk them through in a well-managed environment and take it from there .
right ? all of those are man-made , artificiality brought into the woods by you , and by the very nature of being there .
we predict his eye color .
there &apos;s a ted talk on motivation that debunks that we work for money , and it presents science on how we &apos;re really motivated by three things , in terms of larger creative tasks , when we work for something bigger than ourselves .
( music ) and i &apos;m going to slow it down because things sound cooler when they &apos;re slower . ( music )
and then came the long ...
( applause )
of course , it doesn ’ t matter , because it could also be that they ’ re not .
in fact , we don &apos;t know about any life beyond earth ,
this is a place called the madangiri settlement colony , which is a very developed slum about 25 minutes outside new delhi , where i met these characters who showed me around for the day .
ask them really interesting questions .
three , property rights .
there were numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment : burning at the stake , disemboweling , breaking on the wheel , being pulled apart by horses and so on .
i invite you to literally share the narratives that you create on our facebook page for citizen university .
so here &apos;s my wife &apos;s bad knee on the left , and her just hiking now four months later in aspen , and doing well .
so these projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots — 8 ft . , 12 ft. long proteins .
and we &apos;ve heard those things about &quot; &quot; is it nurture or is it nature , &quot; &quot; right ?
but what good is this for the worm ?
and the benefit to the sponsors is the sum of the publicity and societal benefits over the long term .
bang ! the gun goes off .
none of them are taught in cooking schools .
and so the next time you meet someone , a stranger , one request : understand that you live in the subjective truth , and so does he .
and these technologies are going to be marketed to all of us as panaceas for deceit , and they will prove incredibly useful some day .
this cloud is completely , 100 percent artificial .
if your enemy was really happy , why would they bother to be your enemy ?
and this has unleashed tremendous energy .
and what i see is that the animal &apos;s brain sets up its initial processing of that sound in a form that &apos;s idealized , within the limits of its processing achievements to represent it in an organized and orderly way .
talk to me . yes . yes . you can say yes .
( laughter ) sw : what about a skunk ?
and they were all eager to learn so they could finish the game as well .
and that &apos;s what it looked like .
no one outside of our lab has seen these yet .
there are lots of ways we have of avoiding and numbing and bypassing pain , but the point of all of this is to deal with the cause of the problem .
so in one of their projects called southwark circle , they worked with residents in southwark , south london and a small team of designers to develop a new membership organization to help the elderly with household tasks .
people are a little risk-averse . so what ?
and that gives me hope because people are not purely selfish .
i check and — ( applause ) i check that email account religiously all the time .
and , in fact , there &apos;s been an interesting coevolution that &apos;s been going on between wolfram alpha and its human users , and it &apos;s really encouraging .
there are so many reasons why we can &apos;t be , indeed , we &apos;re not sure why we should be .
but they &apos;re very small , you know ?
but we &apos;re beginning to see a sea change .
and they use low-intensity electric fields to fight cancer .
but the media lab is an interesting place , and it &apos;s important to me because as a student , i was a computer science undergrad , and i discovered design later on in my life .
indeed , we designed it together with neurobiologists to understand how animals move , and especially how the spinal cord controls locomotion .
and then you put tree seeds in here , and then you end up growing — potentially — an old-growth forest from a cardboard box .
well the act of drawing airplanes led me to , when i had the opportunity to choose a course in school , led me to sign up for aeronautical engineering .
and his design skills — improbable though it sounds — would be essential in enabling him to do so .
but then i would discover something new and totally different , and i would dive into that .
and so , anuj and acumen have been talking about testing the private sector , because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that , look , in a country like tanzania , 80 percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day .
i hit the gun club .
but they can adapt only so far , and then when all the water is gone from the surface , microbes have only one solution left : they go underground .
so this is for real .
what is the default setting if people do nothing , if they keep procrastinating , if they don &apos;t check the boxes ?
why did we ever do it ?
we &apos;re looking to see if we can take captured co2 , which can easily be piped to sites , convert that co2 back into fuel to drive this process .
but we break it down to some basic realities .
we call it the cloud of normality .
and it was singing all day long . and when it stops it means that it just died .
his intent is to be funny .
it &apos;s the only swim i &apos;m interested in .
and &#91; their &#93; kids will be saved , and their grandchildren will be saved , and this passes on .
and that &apos;s the growing fertility .
all of those things matter , but that &apos;s not why .
and so i engaged my father after dinner in long , sometimes heated conversations .
and in my 35 years of working experience , i think i was really serious four times .
if anything , they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already and to build on their own capabilities .
there &apos;s this fact that i love that i read somewhere once , that one of the things that &apos;s contributed to homo sapiens &apos; success as a species is our lack of body hair — that our hairlessness , our nakedness combined with our invention of clothing , gives us the ability to modulate our body temperature and thus be able to survive in any climate we choose .
the other thing is that maybe that fowler apple or maybe a variety of wheat that &apos;s not economical right now has disease or pest resistance or some quality that we &apos;re going to need for climate change that the others don &apos;t .
so we asked the goose to do it again , and hoped she would do somehow , a more elegant or pretty job .
typical post-conflict situation is a zoo of different actors with different priorities .
we &apos;re going to look at the mid-ocean ridge , a 40,000-mile long mountain range .
instead , i am looking forward to , at least somehow , the year of the insurance , or the year of the great harvest .
we &apos;re actually projecting in another 10 years the level of disenfranchisement will be as high as it &apos;s been since prior to the passage of the voting rights act .
and we &apos;ve just recently demonstrated this by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads , and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate .
( laughter ) one of the things i did just before 9 / 11 — august of 2001 — i took my son , dax , who was 16 at the time , and i took him to pakistan .
look here you have china over there , you have india over there , and this is what has happened .
i &apos;ll show an old video . kelly was a sculptor , and this is what she did with her semester project .
this entire process lasts around 60 minutes , but when the process is over , wells that shine are matched with the specific micrornas and analyzed in terms of how much and how fast they shine .
out of four british people , three said that they were optimistic about the future of their own families .
let me give you one example from the world of recruiting , where reputation data will make the résumé seem like an archaic relic of the past .
so there &apos;s deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success .
this certainly is an accomplishment that must never be surpassed .
so a tremendous fund of knowledge despite , again , that so many people told her not to do it , it was too expensive .
but there is another world .
for instance , there are two different types of facial surgery .
and i &apos;m not saying this to save myself , although this would be nice . i &apos;m doing it to save you , because if you do this , you will be lost . &quot; &quot; to be so afraid that you &apos;re standing in the face of a death you can &apos;t escape and that you &apos;re soiling yourself and crying , but to say in that moment , as fraser says to idris , &quot; &quot; tell my girlfriend i love her . &quot; &quot; in that moment , fraser says , &quot; i am lost already , but not you ... not you . &quot;
we know that the problem begins immediately .
now you can get much higher returns , of up to 16-to-one , if you include anti-crime benefits , if you include benefits to former preschool participants who move to some other state , but there &apos;s a good reason for focusing on these three dollars because this is salient and important to state legislators and state policy makers , and it &apos;s the states that are going to have to act .
this is the river , covered , used as a trash yard .
for you nerds , here &apos;s a little behind-the-scenes .
take a look at mathematical attainment by 15 year-olds .
they understand that their quality of life depends on a mix of solitude and solidarity .
and we had to create kind of a sauce .
successions of new species emerged , evolved and became extinct .
( music ) i &apos;d like to talk to you today a little bit about the work that my brother hays and i are doing — that &apos;s us there . that &apos;s both of us actually — specifically about a concept that we &apos;ve been developing over the last few years , this idea of location-aware music .
my talk will be about the impact of religions on the number of babies per woman .
we &apos;ve just come out , we &apos;re commercializing , this year , generation 2.0 of the marrow miner .
it &apos;s estimated that about 15 to 30 million people around the world have this disease .
there &apos;s water in between the skull and the transducer .
people didn &apos;t know what caused it until the early 1900s , when a british military man figured out that it was mosquitos .
and during one of our conversations , i witnessed an interaction that changed my life forever .
and we know from his contemporaries that leonardo was a very handsome , even beautiful man .
your doctor has to make sure that you are meaningfully and knowingly consenting to that medical procedure .
this is , it seems a bit dull you know .
( laughter ) it &apos;s a difficult theory to discount , i think you &apos;ll agree . ( laughter )
it was an amazing moment .
but now that the cold war is over , there &apos;s nearly universal consensus in the muslim world — and pretty close to the same here in the united states , if you talk to people and ask them — that in principle , there &apos;s no reason that democracy and islam cannot co-exist .
they &apos;re comical , they walk upright , and , of course , they &apos;re diligent .
( applause )
70 percent reduction in violence on this day at least .
now , what had changed ?
so i thought i &apos;d bring her with me today on stage , to have her as a witness of a remarkable journey , which humbly reminds us of the period of grace we &apos;ve had over the past 10,000 years .
imagine designing spring .
the first one being women moving into the job market , the second one being the aging world population .
( laughter ) perspective is a very powerful thing . perspectives can change . perspectives can be altered . from my perspective , we live on a fragile island of life ,
the guardian wrote , &quot; &quot; if art is about transformation , then there can be no more transformative experience .
the point that we should be worried about is , how much strangeness are we getting ?
but for too many women , that &apos;s not the case .
but so often , they only get trained once , so they &apos;re not aware of new medicines , new guidelines as they come out .
these three people in the village sat down and decided to think , &quot; how do we elongate the life of this girl of our village ? &quot;
and this time even a greater number , 83 percent of the people , voted with blank ballots .
here we go . i want to see a show of hands .
i found myself in a state of constant creation , thinking only of what &apos;s next and coming up with more ideas than ever .
some have 5,000 . many have more .
without water , the bacteria won &apos;t survive .
in fact , it became so extreme i wrote a play about it .
now if your perception is much worse than your reality , what on earth are you doing trying to change the reality ?
( laughter ) it wasn &apos;t all bad .
in fact , those 15 million cellphones are the most connections that any country , including the u.s. and china , has ever established in the history of telecommunications .
that &apos;s because unlike apple , who will sell an iphone to anyone who wants one , nike doesn &apos;t make their money by just selling $ 200 sneakers .
typically , these things are put in the ground .
western societies , and in particular the u.s. , have always favored the man of action over the &quot; &quot; man &quot; &quot; of contemplation .
so , let me now talk about the last mile problem .
now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?
i mean that &apos;s a fabulous amount of money .
it &apos;s really terrifying .
because you would quickly realize , and maybe be confused by the fact , that there are three organizations that are constantly named in the articles .
now , what you also didn &apos;t see was that — and you may have noticed in the pen beside him and , by the way , the camel &apos;s name is suki .
now , this is bernoulli &apos;s gift . this is a direct quote .
in this case , hans had put the data together he had found from all kinds of united nations websites and things .
i believe we &apos;re at a tipping point where this is now something that we can &apos;t avoid .
and what was amazing about that discovery is that it also solved the mystery of what pollinated a unique flower .
it &apos;s got all the ups and the downs of movements .
well , let &apos;s see if we can do that .
bf : there we go !
and one idea comes from lessons from chewing crabs .
so , together these two nations did something truly audacious .
now you may be thinking that 30 is actually a better time to settle down than 20 , or even 25 , and i agree with you .
the great texts of the ancient world don &apos;t survive to us in their original form .
we think back in the glacial , from the analysis we &apos;ve made in the corals , that the deep part of the southern ocean was very rich in carbon , and there was a low-density layer sitting on top .
okay , now this gives one a little pause .
now this sounds a little theoretical , but it &apos;s not so theoretical .
and this is called blind date . it &apos;s a &#91; unclear &#93; , so if you &apos;re too shy to be really at the date , you can stay at a distance with your flowers and somebody else reenacts the date for you .
when i was a kid , i experienced something so powerful , i spent the rest of my life searching for it , and in all the wrong places .
some journeyed to the moons and planets .
so the next rule of the game is also pretty simple .
now it &apos;s more a part of our web of power than ever before .
it &apos;s fantastic , isn &apos;t it ?
i had just done the long jump , and a guy who was missing two legs came up to me and says , &quot; &quot; how do you do that ? you know , we &apos;re supposed to have a planar foot , so we can &apos;t get off on the springboard . &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; well , i just did it . no one told me that . &quot; &quot; so , it &apos;s funny — i &apos;m three inches within the world record — and kept on from that point , you know , so i &apos;m signed up in the long jump — signed up ?
( laughter ) but what if it turns out that barbie &apos;s actually really lonely ? ( laughter )
and that communication , that connectivity around the world , that globalization now raises a burden .
and the other risk , of course , is when you &apos;ve been working so hard for so long , and slept so few hours over the past months , people are tired , people become fatigued , and these new risks start to creep into the response .
we don &apos;t know if it was our handling methods that went wrong and we don &apos;t know if it was just this coral on this reef , always suffering from low fertility .
the ft . worth t has been on it for 25 years .
over the course of two years , my faithful husband dylan and i each spent over 300 hours underground , hiking , crawling and wriggling around 52 sites in france , spain , portugal and sicily .
that &apos;s our value proposition in a prize .
so the images that you saw at the beginning , they are actually a flame stopped in time while it is traveling through the bottle , and you have to imagine it was flipped around 180 degrees .
a camel .
so , what i am is a historian of medicine .
but that is a huge problem .
as a teenager , i was sketching , drawing , and i wanted to be an artist .
we can plot the planarity of the surfaces , their curvature , how radial they are — all information that may not be instantly visible to you , but that we can bring out , that we can articulate , and that we can use to control the folding .
and he called this part of the course the x factor , the potential of the human will .
( laughter ) and that — ( applause ) — in the depths of a very severe economic recession , i think that there &apos;s a really important lesson there , that if you can remember your international obligations whilst you are trying to rebuild your own economy , that &apos;s really something .
and i challenge anybody in the room to make their chest go like this .
so i did something else . i figured out 100 billion clicks per day , 55 trillion links is almost the same as the number of synapses in your brain .
i suspect there are some people out there sitting , kind of asking tormented questions , almost , about , well , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait a minute , there &apos;s something wrong with mankind interfering in nature in this way .
hong kong was a small bit of china that , for most of the 20th century , operated under a very different set of rules than the rest of mainland china — rules that were copied from working market economies of the time , and administered by the british .
just yesterday , we were having our family meeting , and we had voted to work on overreacting .
bicycles have become forbidden many places .
admit even in the year we leased freedom , we didn &apos;t own it outright .
it was and still is one of the worst droughts in living memory .
and they worked absolutely very , very , very hard .
a vascular surgeon removed most of the first rib on both sides of my body .
you know , people say how half of all water well projects , a year later , are failed .
so i was crushing up these pieces of glass , which , as you can see , that &apos;s the actual frame of the house .
because i had to , at a certain point , say , &quot; &quot; what am i doing out here ?
and this is quite challenging because now you have to think about networks of robots .
now the question , is this important ?
first of all , let me get you to the end step .
like , seriously .
because somewhere along the way , sometimes a single failure convinced them that they couldn &apos;t succeed , and they believed it .
you see banks — i don &apos;t know if there are any bankers over here ; i apologize in advance — but it &apos;s the best job in the world .
top 100 companies : how many women running them ?
( laughter ) you can see how this quickly captures your imagination .
so those are cool images . but these are ones i think are really cool .
obviously , we don &apos;t want one of those . ( laughter ) there &apos;s a flip side to it . in studying stars like our sun , we &apos;ve found that they go through periods of diminishment , when their total amount of energy that &apos;s expelled from them goes down by maybe one percent .
( beatboxing ) tedyouth , make some — ( beatboxing ) ( beatboxing ends ) are you ready ?
why could he not understand this ?
voice offstage : four point five .
the security council does its business in exactly the same way today that it did x number of years ago , when i was there 10 years ago .
so i just had to look around the boat and figure out what i was going to use to fix up these oars so that i could carry on .
pm : last night we gave it a few too many turns and it tried to bash the roof out also . it &apos;s about a gram .
&quot; &quot; everyone who knew me before 9 / 11 believes i &apos;m dead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people , so sometimes i didn &apos;t wear panties , and just had a big smile and chuckled to myself . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) this next one takes a little explanation before i share it with you .
i believe in the concept of a raja yogi : be a dude before you can become an ascetic .
so the small ones are short , and the bigger ones are longer .
on a more personal note , steve said , &quot; &quot; if visicalc had been written for some other computer , you &apos;d be interviewing somebody else right now . &quot; &quot; so , visicalc was instrumental in getting personal computers on business desks .
over the next 20 years he &apos;d have 22 surgeries , including four spine operations , and hip replacement after hip replacement .
a coffee cup will show where you can find more coffee , or where you can trash the cup .
hope you get the word out to many people and they go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends , etc .
god forbid .
we feel less accountable for our actions when we interact online .
it was surrounded by three isolated tribes and thanks to the colombian government and colombian colleagues , it has now expanded .
it &apos;s a very powerful principle .
and you can actually use it for our monkeys to either interact with them , or you can train them to assume in a virtual world the first-person perspective of that avatar and use her brain activity to control the movements of the avatar &apos;s arms or legs .
and , more often than not , they die sooner .
what are the planetary boundaries within which we can safely operate ? &quot; &quot; and then backtrack innovations within that .
this is a very un-pc cover . not in new york .
y &apos;all can see that right there .
there &apos;s a hole at the anus , penis level .
dp : this .
we said , &quot; &quot; that was so great , we saved this little girl &apos;s life . &quot; &quot; we were just like , you know , ah , just full of ourselves .
and in the 12th century , a line was drawn , like a musical horizon line , to better pinpoint the pitch &apos;s location .
we need to have a meal that we can trust , live long lives .
but it slightly bores me .
so then you have to make the decision .
but — ( applause ) but 2016 ! the first !
they are instead the products of downstream imagination leading to hard work , during which mathematical reasoning may or may not prove to be relevant .
audience : yeah !
i can bolster my own identity .
without human rights , you don &apos;t have the protection granted to you to campaign .
then we put a little chip , little tag , onto the trash and then started following it .
and you see , turbo &apos;s pretty intent on his flipper patting .
( laughter ) so , i made a hydrogen generator and i made an oxygen generator , and i had the two pipes leading into a beaker and i threw a match in . ( laughter )
help me ! somebody help me ! &quot; &quot; and the next thing is paralysis .
now , it was a big risk , and it wouldn &apos;t work for every story , but we showed with the panama papers that you can write about any country from just about anywhere , and then choose your preferred battleground to defend your work .
so if you were a little tiny bug living in a flower , what would that flower look like , if the flower was this big ?
for perfect scientific certainty .
and this peaks at super bowl sunday when guys would rather be in a bar with strangers , watching a totally overdressed aaron rodgers of the green bay packers , rather than jennifer lopez totally naked in the bedroom .
and when it comes to sensory restoration , we &apos;re still very far away from being able to provide beauty .
but if these machines have been around for almost 30 years , why don &apos;t we know about them ?
they have a little refueling stop in northeastern india .
you &apos;re walking by the side of the road and you &apos;re hit by a truck , or you &apos;re trying to to jump on a moving train , you &apos;re late for work , and your pant leg gets caught .
and what i love the most about this is really when the students come up to me sometimes afterwards , all surprised and a little confused , and say , &quot; &quot; i just spent two hours in this virtual lab , and ... and i didn &apos;t check facebook . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) that &apos;s how engaging and immersive this really is for the students .
i love this because it looks so easy .
so i just figured that out earlier .
( laughter ) everybody in house loved it , and so off it goes to the author .
and that year , in kosovo , this terrible , terrible thing happened , which i saw .
and indeed , you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex , which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats .
dh : whenever you &apos;re ready there , big guy .
and this very encouraging story , i think , is partly demographic-led .
if you consider a child &apos;s eyes as a pair of biological cameras , they take one picture about every 200 milliseconds , the average time an eye movement is made .
and he finished his talk with the phrase , that , &quot; &quot; the gross national product measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile . &quot; &quot; how crazy is that ? that our measure of progress , our dominant measure of progress in society , is measuring everything except that which makes life worthwhile ?
they also affect people who want to send messages , because this is really a transformation of the ecosystem as a whole , not just a particular strategy .
and it &apos;s in the six official languages of the united nations .
at the same time , while i was interviewing the red brigades , i also discovered that their life was not ruled by politics or ideology , but actually was ruled by economics .
and so , if you think about the precision of these mirrors , the bumps on the mirror , over the entire 27 feet , amount to less than one-millionth of an inch .
he was starting to look glassy-eyed .
we cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind of a foreground for this hotel .
so we thought we &apos;d just kind of model — different amounts of uv hit different parts of the earth at different times of year , so you can actually work out those stores of nitric oxide — the nitrates , nitrites , nitrosothiols in the skin — cleave to release no .
there are various things in here : i could say we might raise more revenue , or medical innovation will make the spending even higher .
five million people have taken it .
( applause ) number seven : particle accelerator mishap .
with the same method , we can also get him to circle a person .
it empowered authorities , and , as a result , marginalized citizens .
ca : it must have been just an extraordinarily emotional day because of these questions about identity , the joy of seeing you and perhaps an emphasized sense of what they had lost .
a third explanation invokes the concept of a nonzero-sum game , and was worked out in the book &quot; &quot; nonzero &quot; &quot; by the journalist robert wright . wright points out that in certain circumstances , cooperation or non-violence can benefit both parties in an interaction , such as gains in trade when two parties trade their surpluses and both come out ahead , or when two parties lay down their arms and split the so-called peace dividend that results in them not having to fight the whole time .
and partly to usa who help to provide technical advice and investment .
now , before i go any further , yes , i know it all began with &quot; &quot; britain &apos;s got talent . &quot; &quot; but my point in discussing this is to show you — i hope i &apos;ll be able to show you how these merit-based competitions , with equal access to everyone , with the winner selected via voting by sms , are changing tribal societies .
and we bring together every summer about 100 very talented students from around the world .
and worse than that , far worse than that , my sense of self-worth was kind of evaporating .
you probably went out and bought them .
what i really want to do , is i want to use this new data to try to figure out what makes the hiv epidemic grow faster or slower .
woolenness and wetness aren &apos;t exactly two concepts that go together .
( laughter ) ka : what does it mean ?
the data is then sent on a cellular network to well-equipped hospitals hundreds of miles away for analysis .
as another example , if we look at what determines an individual &apos;s wages , and we do statistical exploration of that , what determines wages , we know that the individual &apos;s wages will depend , in part , on that individual &apos;s education , for example whether or not they have a college degree .
so think about the future — it will be here soon enough .
and that &apos;s terraforming the planet : making it more like earth , reengineering an entire planet .
the wire is ready .
so in the beginning the monkey could not perform this task at all .
if the officer is honest , you get a huge penalty of being arrested for bribery .
and this exhibition is about the work of designers that help us be more elastic , and also of designers that really work on this elasticity as an opportunity . and one last thing is that it &apos;s not only designers , but it &apos;s also scientists .
and we will think about that when we look at the wider picture of the world in 1858 .
but the time now is to move from mourning and grief to action and transformation .
now we used to think that the different shape of the lure was to attract different types of prey , but then stomach content analyses on these fish done by scientists , or more likely their graduate students , have revealed that they all eat pretty much the same thing .
and every single entry had to be listened to , experienced and then based on the musical ability — then that person could either enter or not .
that &apos;s what he said .
they didn &apos;t know what couldn &apos;t be done .
listen , we have become great protectors .
they &apos;re crowd-mapping the activities of the drug dealers .
the average american used to be more than 20 times richer than the average chinese .
the second area , in brown , is the world &apos;s pastures and rangelands , where our animals live .
so before agriculture , before the agricultural revolution , it &apos;s important to understand that human beings lived in hunter-gatherer groups that are characterized wherever they &apos;re found in the world by what anthropologists called fierce egalitarianism .
and i noticed that a lot of them seemed bored .
and it &apos;s in there that those mini-big bangs will be created , sometime in the summer this year .
all right , recently i started a public art project where i don &apos;t use my artwork anymore .
dr. atkins and i debated each other many times before he died , and we agreed that americans eat too many simple carbs , the &quot; &quot; bad carbs , &quot; &quot; and these are things like — ( laughter ) — sugar , white flour , white rice , alcohol . and you get a double whammy : you get all these calories that don ’ t fill you up because you ’ ve removed the fiber , and they get absorbed quickly so your blood sugar zooms up .
i have eternal imposter syndrome .
there &apos;s certainly no quick security fix .
voice : mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow , and everywhere that mary went , the lamb was sure to go .
well , reality is a bit more complicated than this .
which brings me back to the garden of eden .
when you want the taste that won &apos;t weigh you down , the only way to go is up .
imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks .
thank you . ( applause ) ( applause ) thanks . ( applause )
second woman : dad , mom , i grew up .
that gave an advantage ; that was an implication of the technology &apos;s rise that wasn &apos;t obvious to everybody .
and where we have this gypsum strip they can harvest this water .
we were looking at dead volcanoes in arizona .
and we found all sorts of molecules , they &apos;re called halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins , that respond to green and yellow light .
i will tell that woman that my students can talk about transcendentalism like their last name was thoreau , and just because you watched one episode of &quot; &quot; the wire &quot; &quot; doesn &apos;t mean you know anything about my kids .
i &apos;m going to play a piece of music for you .
if you &apos;re in it , india , obviously , is the place to be at the moment .
we created public health care .
he went to the equivalent of an audubon society meeting .
the bottles connect together , and you can create different shapes , different forms .
but society continues to stigmatize and criminalize living in your vehicle or on the streets .
you cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water .
is this guy dangerous or just nervous ?
there are other pleasures , but this is dominant .
it &apos;s hard not to love data like that , and many people will tell you that that means that there &apos;s a worldview that you have if you speak one of those languages .
i &apos;m not going to tell you how many times it took us to make that happen .
thank you .
freeman dyson , in a ted talk , foresaw that children will design and create new organisms just as routinely as his generation played with chemistry sets .
yet , of course , like all music , it &apos;s essentially not about anything .
long john silver is not afraid of you finishing your copy of &quot; &quot; treasure island . &quot; &quot; and so it should be with us .
but i also had noticed that it wasn &apos;t working .
now this would have been a wonderful paper .
and i want to focus on mathematics .
so the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light .
it says we don &apos;t have a right to our bodies .
you put them all together , you mix them up in a bouillabaisse , and you have consumer confidence that &apos;s basically a ticking time-bomb .
the sahara was much bigger then than it is now .
as citizens , we are ready to decide on our common destinies , because we know that the way we distribute power says a lot about how we actually value everyone , and because we know that enabling and participating in local politics is a sign that we truly care about our relations to one another , and we are ready to do this in cities around the world right now .
if he &apos;s using path integration , then it should end up in the wrong spot over here .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality .
but they don &apos;t have to . they can contribute .
the egyptian people , and many other arabs who &apos;ve revolted and are in transition , have very high expectations of the government .
so , you can go to a natural source .
and i hope that compassion will be both fun and profitable for you too .
created by these very people who live , work and play in these particular spaces , these neighborhoods are intuitively designed to make the most of their circumstances .
because i want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible .
i don &apos;t know why . you know what i &apos;m saying .
and eventually after 103 days at sea , i arrived in antigua .
i was there because a colleague of mine named katrina spade is attempting to create a system , not of cremating the dead , but composting the dead .
the first is competitive , because they &apos;re looking for mates , and the second is cooperative , because if they &apos;re all vocalizing in sync together , it makes it really difficult for predators like coyotes , foxes and owls to single out any individual for a meal .
my son still had his dad .
where do we get this spark of imagination ?
but you know what the actual facts are ?
and you may be familiar with the movie &quot; &quot; contact , &quot; &quot; which sort of popularized that .
she switches from reverse to forward and she holds onto the wheel , rather than turns it .
and that &apos;s 70 percent of the united states stock market , 70 percent of the operating system formerly known as your pension , your mortgage .
that &apos;s what i do .
this is a movement for everyone .
i know that some of you here are worth more — ( laughter ) individually than the entire economy of my country .
and i developed a certitude , a faith that convinced me that i will get safely to the other side .
but you don &apos;t leave them where you found them . okay ?
several years ago , i decided to write down my experiences and my personal journey , and i want to share some more of that story with you today to convey the inside view .
today , i am more independent , but it is still not enough .
and i find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern is completely symmetrical , and it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical , or random sky .
parts of me died early on , and that &apos;s something we can all say one way or another .
they are better at recognizing other people &apos;s fear .
they completely forget .
that &apos;s not the way to solve problems .
but when we met , barack was a community organizer .
( laughter ) what can we do to it ?
and while junkies think that it &apos;s a really bad idea to expose themselves to hiv , they think it &apos;s a much worse idea to spend the next year in jail where they &apos;ll probably end up in frankie &apos;s situation and expose themselves to hiv anyway .
first of all , does everyone have the basic needs of survival : food , water , shelter , safety ?
what i &apos;m trying to say is , i &apos;m not trying to prove which system of transport is better .
well , with experiments , what you can do is answer a simple question .
and this wasn &apos;t a pretty thing .
all right , so it &apos;s here . this y2k + 10 problem is at our door .
and some people get 100 percent discount , and some people get 20 percent discounts , and some people get 50 percent discount , etc .
now we &apos;ve never seen a shadow like this of a black hole , but black holes can be heard , even if they &apos;re not seen .
but it works pretty well .
you see , yeah , perfect .
( laughter ) at the end of the course , the students got a certificate .
and in a bacterium , the crispr system allows that dna to be plucked out of the virus , and inserted in little bits into the chromosome — the dna of the bacterium .
( laughter ) or so we thought , until a woman came rushing across the campus and dropped her bag on the floor , pointed up to the sign and said , &quot; who &apos;s falafel ? &quot; ( laughter )
should i be pro-technology ? should i embrace it full arms ?
the goal of this project , which we called the hive , was to prototype the experience of humans , computers and robots all working together to solve a highly complex design problem .
case in point , einstein .
they don &apos;t draw to sell the work to a client or play the piano to earn money for the family .
but why has it taken so long ?
thank you .
do we take that william blake is somehow more of a human than gertrude stein ?
it &apos;s actually very hot .
but you can always talk to their dog or their baby .
these are chemical clocks , and they &apos;re found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell .
i &apos;m assuming there are not many people here who speak icelandic .
we mark it with a gps fix , and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen , so we could essentially put it back on the surface , exactly where we found it .
it was our mindset , because we are not behaving as a media outlet .
so if someone says , &quot; &quot; oh , i see the portrait , &quot; &quot; it may not be the portrait after a few months .
i guess so . because in a way , if a tedster relates to all the interconnectedness of all the computers and everything , it &apos;s the forging of a mass awareness , of where everybody can really know everything that &apos;s going on everywhere in the planet .
and one of my friends , now , he has a family of eight , and he supports his whole family with a blog that he writes for twice a week .
thank you very much . i appreciate that .
the high point of the public theater , i think , was in 1996 , two years after i designed it , which was the &quot; &quot; bring in &apos; da noise , bring in &apos; da funk &quot; &quot; campaign that was all over new york .
kb : neither , oh , ok .
so , here we got the white area in the middle , and you can pick it up .
( laughter ) th : exactly . so why does this stand out ?
one of the things i &apos;m most happy about is that the spaceshipone is going to hang in air and space museum , next to the spirit of st. louis and the wright flyer .
and it doesn &apos;t really matter — i don &apos;t want you understand why it doesn &apos;t have the if statement , but i want you to understand that sometimes you can see a problem in a different way and rewrite it so that a special case goes away and becomes the normal case .
imagine a world and basically everybody was 20 to 30 years old .
now , it turns out that there &apos;s something fundamental about antibiotics which makes it different from other drugs , which is that if i misuse antibiotics or i use antibiotics , not only am i affected but others are affected as well , in the same way as if i choose to drive to work or take a plane to go somewhere , that the costs i impose on others through global climate change go everywhere , and i don &apos;t necessarily take these costs into consideration .
it seems to me that there is this latent potential everywhere , all around us .
many of these buildings are incredibly beautiful , and also much more effective .
all the branches of the trees , the leaves that come down create a humid area , and they take months and months under the water , go to the rivers , and maintain our source , maintain our rivers .
because what people want is what politicians try , they don &apos;t always succeed , but they try and deliver .
they have shown an exemplary bravery in confronting the brutal dictatorship of gaddafi .
but today , i &apos;m going to pick three i find interesting and share what actually it reminds me about launching new products and services .
we don &apos;t know why some cells want to do one repair pathway and some cells would rather do the other .
and this has already saved millions of lives , and it has prevented entire economies from capsizing in sub-saharan africa .
now , this movie has floated around hollywood for well over half a century , and we first got involved with the project in the early &apos; 90s , with ron howard as the director .
so here &apos;s what you do .
this kind of trafficking , in narcotics , in humans , in weapons , god forbid , in weapons of mass destruction , is part of the threat to the global commons .
we &apos;ve managed to adapt , and have conquered the whole planet .
and when her daughter was born , she suddenly found herself confronting questions that now began to seem quite resonant to me .
of course one can make a biological argument .
steve sillett and marie antoine are the principal explorers of the redwood forest canopy . they &apos;re world-class athletes , and they also are world-class forest ecology scientists .
we need an infrastructure dynamic enough to handle these seismic shifts in our population .
and i can do that in the first year and i can balance that in the next 10 , and the next 20 years , this energy , which is necessary to condition a world cup in qatar , the next 20 years , this energy goes into the grid of qatar .
the regional branch managers are getting nervous .
so , even though sometimes it &apos;s still hard , i will share with you that it helps me to realize society is more tolerant , usually because of places like this , because of ideas like this , and people like you , with an open mind .
so let &apos;s have a look and see how this works when multiple people communicate .
and in total — we just reported this last year — we found over 200 species of biofluorescent fish .
and obviously they were , &quot; &quot; is this what you spent years doing ?
but i was convinced i was going to get him to buy a license plate protector .
basically , no one &apos;s very happy .
clearly , the internet is already having eyes and ears , you have web cams and so forth . but it &apos;s going to also have legs and hands .
i &apos;m a little bit of an amateur historian , so i &apos;ve spent some time going back , trying to see the first mention of this kind of thing . and the best , earliest quote that i could find was one from david livingstone , writing in the 1850s about how the railroad , the steam ship , and the telegraph were integrating east africa perfectly with the rest of the world .
so the cost of the climate crisis is mounting up , there are many of these aspects i haven &apos;t even mentioned .
and so you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis , it will create a disc of light that we can control .
something i never talk about in scientific meetings is how i actually got to this state and why i do the work that i do .
i came across this story about the ancient greek writer , homer .
it &apos;s a waste product .
but sometimes , we have to advocate for ourselves .
these guys came up with a kit version for 750 dollars , and that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks can get a hold of this and begin playing with 3d printers .
we all have a role in making a difference .
ca : so that would produce irrigation for the entire village ?
but the thing that i know you all have heard a lot of times , american soldiers saying , &quot; why don &apos;t they talk about the good stuff that we do ? &quot;
while i was taking care of them , we got more news about rob hall .
based on this trial , in april of this year , the fda approved tumor treating fields for the treatment of patients with recurrent gbm .
what is power ?
even in popular literature , the only book i &apos;ve ever found — and this should be on all of your reading lists — the only book i &apos;ve ever found that makes the entrepreneur into the hero is &quot; &quot; atlas shrugged . &quot; &quot; everything else in the world tends to look at entrepreneurs and say that we &apos;re bad people .
don &apos;t spit , don &apos;t do anything wrong , so that the clean water can be collected .
it &apos;s about zero-sum and non-zero-sum games .
thank you .
but more likely is this .
they were all tired of the fighting .
but it wasn &apos;t just individuals .
and so it is with archimedes , the great greek mathematician .
( laughter ) text : relpy to all .
a city could find oil or diamonds underground and it would not be so valuable as road space .
i get asked a lot what the difference between my work is and typical pentagon long-range strategic planners .
but still , maybe this is something weird about my brain and no one else has one of these things in there , so to find out , we scanned a bunch of other people and found that pretty much everyone has that little face-processing region in a similar neighborhood of the brain .
audience : yeah .
but in fact , they found something very surprising .
it &apos;s not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored , because there &apos;s nothing for the drug to bind to .
because what we realize today is that modern culture appears to have adopted a strategy of tragedy .
fifteen minutes later — next question : where is calcutta ?
when the war ended , we were released , and given a one-way ticket to anywhere in the united states .
so many emotions seem to be inside of it .
let &apos;s look at this cartoon .
then it was as if i stepped back and thought that i could have very well been one of them .
adam smith , 200 years ago , spoke about our desire for a life without shame .
because where we have a surplus of technology in the cybersecurity industry , we have a definite lack of — call me old-fashioned — human intelligence .
there &apos;s something almost quite magical about visual information .
and yet , in many places , a third of the children , by the time they &apos;re three already are facing a life of hardship due to this .
&quot; &quot; my life sucks because i live under a tyrant , also known as king george .
so our energy future is not fate , but choice , and that choice is very flexible .
why are you putting yourself at risk ?
if we could reduce the usage of paper towels , one paper towel per person per day , 571,230,000 pounds of paper not used .
( applause )
any actor in a democracy is embedded in a network of relationships .
at the point where you can weaponize your buildings , you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way .
as you can see , it has world class art , and it &apos;s all my taste because i raised all the money .
so the big difference today , wealth inequality is still very large , with 60 , 70 percent of total wealth for the top 10 , but the good news is that it &apos;s actually better than one century ago , where you had 90 percent in europe going to the top 10 .
this , in the past , is why you didn &apos;t mess with isolated indians .
this is about justice . really .
some part of me — a true living , breathing person — has become programmed , electronic and virtual .
the observation that stem cells , as master cells , could give rise to a whole variety of different cell types — heart cells , liver cells , pancreatic islet cells — captured the attention of the media and the imagination of the public .
they &apos;re feasting . &quot; &quot; feasting ? i was totally confused .
i can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles .
( laughter ) and the good news is i don &apos;t have a prepared speech , but i have a box of slides .
do it over lunch .
you may remember these guys .
and this is one that i did , probably like when i was around seventh grade , and i remember when i was doing this , i was thinking about that little rock there , and the pathway of the vehicles as they would fly through the air , and how the characters — ( laughter ) — would come shooting out of the car , so , on my mind , i was thinking about the trajectory of the vehicles .
they &apos;ve got an apple here from south africa .
now , our data processing on this is still preliminary , but it really seems that these phenomenal feats that the race car drivers are performing are instinctive .
so ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative reality .
one first saying that i &apos;m sure you all have heard is the fact that too much screen time makes your eyesight worse .
well , if we really think about it , we see that the business model of the internet today really isn &apos;t compatible with privacy .
it didn &apos;t happen accidentally .
as a starting point for discussion with the ted group , a major part of the problem is the nature of the written extent of informed consent that the patient or spouse must read and sign .
so does this kind of conversation happen in the real world , not just in these design meetings ?
you up for that ? okay .
( applause ) this baby is fully electric .
anyway , this project , or this experience , make me start a new project on the design of medicine .
and we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism .
everybody : i am my connectome .
this is why we have set up the governance school and the center for civil society here in berlin , because we believe most of our educational and research institutions in germany and continental europe in general , do not focus enough , yet , on empowering civil society and training the leadership of civil society .
energy use . organisms sip energy , because they have to work or barter for every single bit that they get .
just flash it , scare the guy . he &apos;s a punk .
but anyway , this is about the evils of science , so i think it ’ s perfect .
it &apos;s such a simple question , but these days , of course , simple questions bring ever more complicated answers .
all the time he &apos;s been doing 65 miles per hour down the freeway .
i got tired of seeing this happening .
they were calling it the &quot; &quot; billy possum . &quot; &quot; within 24 hours , the georgia billy possum company was up and running , brokering deals for these things nationwide , and the los angeles times announced , very confidently , &quot; &quot; the teddy bear has been relegated to a seat in the rear , and for four years , possibly eight , the children of the united states will play with billy possum . &quot; &quot; so from that point , there was a fit of opossum fever .
each question , there &apos;s a possible answer between zero and a hundred , and at the end of the quiz , you get an overall score between zero and a hundred .
shhhhhhhhhh .
why are they doing that ? because they expect investment to follow .
this room may appear to be holding 600 people , but there &apos;s actually so many more , because in each one of us there is a multitude of personalities .
since then , i &apos;ve played other places that are much nicer .
inclusive leadership is critical to putting people first .
and he said , &quot; &quot; she read it once and then she read it again . &quot; &quot; and she turned to him and said , &quot; is that our cat ? &quot;
now , capitalism has been responsible for every major innovation that &apos;s made this world a more inspiring and wonderful place to live in .
i think that the world trade center in , rather an unfortunate way , brought architecture into focus in a way that i don &apos;t think people had thought of in a long time , and made it a subject for common conversation .
you can spot it in the provocation of a button , an arm poking at a sleeve , a balancing act at a night-time curb while negotiating the dark .
i decided to take a sabbatical , in fact , at the new school , bruce .
now obviously , every time i bring this up , people even , you know , here at the conference , say , &quot; are you serious ? thirty stories ? how &apos;s that going to happen ? &quot;
the question is : how much would people like joshua bell , the music of joshua bell , if they didn &apos;t know they were listening to joshua bell ?
plastic just is not going to do it . &quot; &quot; we sort of worked things out .
nakilia invited reuben too , but — rockett : but what ? isn &apos;t he coming ?
we also have to have energy .
the title of the book is , &quot; &quot; what the dormouse said : how the &apos; 60s counterculture shaped the personal computer industry . &quot; &quot; the title was taken from the lyrics to a jefferson airplane song . the lyrics go , &quot; &quot; remember what the dormouse said .
is that likely , do you think , here ?
so — ( laughter ) and the feedback for the p.a. system is no help at all .
they were put into a segregated all japanese-american unit and sent to the battlefields of europe , and they threw themselves into it .

so , this table i &apos;ve given just to emphasize that i &apos;ve only talked about two examples .
what does that mean ?
because generally in britain if you want to make us happy about something , just tell us we do it better than the germans .
and we basically founded the park on the idea of an endowment that would pay the equivalent lost fishing license fees to this very poor country to keep the area intact .
in the midst of the daunting challenges we face as a global community , there &apos;s something about this third way raga that is making my heart sing .
okay . i do too .
it isn &apos;t just a behavior .
i graduated from university to become a theater director , and that progress is entirely to do with the fact that people i &apos;ll never meet fought for women to have rights , get the vote , get education , have progress .
thank you .
but before i dive into those i want to admit that i am an optimist .
here &apos;s my solution .
i know it has for me .
all big societies that have governments , and where most people are strangers to each other , are inevitably similar to each other and different from tribal societies .
and i also ask myself , does it really work ?
we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement .
in japan , toilets are computers and there &apos;s even hackers who hack them .
i was on a high .
considering this , east germany was a very modern dictatorship .
you see it in many different ways .
we believe that we have found a way to do so , and this is the first time that we &apos;ve shown it in public .
the question of whether disgust ought to influence our moral and political judgments certainly has to be complex , and might depend on exactly what judgments we &apos;re talking about , and as a scientist , we have to conclude sometimes that the scientific method is just ill-equipped to answer these sorts of questions .
and i run a community lab .
let me tell you about mariana popa who worked in redbridge , east london .
of those that don &apos;t abort , atrazine causes impaired mammary , or breast , development in the exposed daughters in utero , so that their breast don &apos;t develop properly .
we &apos;re moving in our homes , in our offices , as we shop and we travel throughout our cities and around our world .
it &apos;s really beautiful , and it conjures up all these various different emotions , but he couldn &apos;t photograph everything , and to tell the story , i had to fill in the gaps , which is now rather daunting , because now i have to recreate back to back what really happened and i had , i &apos;m the only one who could really blow it at that point .
i mean , in the 18th century , in the 18th century you could become an expert on any field of science in an afternoon by going to a library , if you could find the library , right ?
i wanted to know their stories .
just heard that he claimed that you play the piano in an opium den . &quot; &quot; and the father says , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m very sorry . yes , it &apos;s true , i lied .
and so what are those trends ?
you could , if you &apos;re really smart , you could shine a nonlethal laser on the bug before you zap it , and you could listen to the wing beat frequency and you could measure the size .
and then we poured a big foundation for passive solar .
scott adams ran into us and asked us if we wouldn &apos;t help to design the ultimate cubicle for dilbert , which sounded like a fun thing and so we couldn &apos;t pass it up .
and the big challenge was how to understand the meaning of the symptom in this specific cultural context .
now , economists tend to — ( applause ) — economists tend to view the world through their own lenses , which is : this is just a bunch of stupid people .
leibniz , the german mathematician , talked about geomancy in his dissertation called &quot; &quot; de combinatoria . &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; well , instead of using one stroke and two strokes , let &apos;s use a one and a zero , and we can count by powers of two . &quot; &quot; right ? ones and zeros , the binary code .
i probably learned the most about relationships .
i &apos;m from edinburgh . worse news , that &apos;s even edinburgh .
the farm &apos;s incredible .
and i think that moment of completely new thought perhaps creates a freedom that spreads to the rest of other people &apos;s lives .
and i think that &apos;s a wonderful and significant story .
as i went back , every time i went , i found that my neighbors &apos; girls were getting married .
but then they suspected , they thought there was an architect behind it .
and with him , i was able to do a project that was really fantastic .
so i might ask : &quot; &quot; who is it for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; what does it say ? &quot;
( applause ) now i know definitely which one i would choose .
but here &apos;s where it gets tricky .
in india , they &apos;ve got another couple bookmobiles running around .
and so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together because we had to go back .
we have at our fingertips a cornucopia of compelling models , powerful tools , and innovative ideas that can make a meaningful difference in our planet &apos;s future .
because this is where it all really began , isn &apos;t it ?
thank you .
but in the regards to using sustainability as a parameter , as a criteria for fueling systems-based solutions , because as i &apos;ve just demonstrated with these simple products , they &apos;re participating in these major problems .
they are blind from diseases that are either completely curable or preventable .
we let people watch , for the first time in their life , a tv episode from the bbc series &quot; &quot; sherlock , &quot; &quot; while we scanned their brains .
i mean to be able to take off from your home , you &apos;d have to be extremely quiet .
and this was a moment of great pain and trauma because i couldn &apos;t live with it any longer .
we &apos;re used to talking about stars .
but this is what most schools serve .
but the small stuff , what you might call the user interface , is done spectacularly badly .
and we &apos;ve made a wayback machine that you can then go and see old websites kind of the way they were .
i want to tell you how we found that out .
and the reason that it &apos;s proved very successful is it &apos;s private , it &apos;s anonymous , it &apos;s fast , and it &apos;s cheap .
what on earth is wrong with placebos ?
i also make drawings to help people understand things .
and the avian flu is also not a good idea .
the chinese market collapsed , but it rebounded .
and if we just take that and we build from there , then we can go to the next step , which is that if the ocean ain &apos;t happy , ain &apos;t nobody happy .
echinacea , a little antioxidant to get you going .
it &apos;s impressions about blindness that are far more threatening to blind people than the blindness itself .
and there &apos;s some great ideas already in our patch .
so , about the worst kind of breast cancer you can get .
60 homes were destroyed , and 40 were damaged .
it couldn &apos;t be further from the truth for me .
so to do that , what you really need to do , you need to look at the things that the genes are producing and what &apos;s happening after the genetics , and that &apos;s what proteomics is about .
people who have lived in the same location for a long period of time retain a connection to the place where they live that many of the rest of us have lost .
by any economic standard , the demand for art of all forms is skyrocketing , as you can tell from the price of opera tickets , by the number of books sold , by the number of books published , the number of musical titles released , the number of new albums and so on .
honey is a great nutritional substitute for regular sugar because there are different types of sugars in there .
but , lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days , so , it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through .
companies tend to scale up vertically by centralizing operations in big factories and warehouses , but if you want to be agile and deal with immense customer diversity , you need to scale out horizontally using a distributed supply chain with smaller manufacturing and distribution units , like grameen bank has shown .
we need very large archives , and we need excellent specialists .
think of the collective anger in tahrir square , which brought down a dictator .
and i ’ m going to run a little experiment . another little experiment .
and the third one is : do free bed nets discourage future purchase ?
we put it out there .
the surgery was done laparoscopically , so i have just five very small scars on my abdomen , and i had four weeks away from work and went back to doing everything i &apos;d done before without any changes .
but maybe that &apos;s because in architecture school , we don &apos;t really learn how to engage the public in the act of design .
so imagine hundreds of millions of voters casting hundreds of millions of votes , all to be counted correctly and all the things that can possibly go wrong causing all these bad headlines , and you cannot help but feel exhausted at the idea of trying to make elections better .
was it designed around cars or around people ?
except , i even started painting dancers .
( laughter ) i went to visit kitty carlisle hart , and she is 96 , and when i brought her a copy of &quot; &quot; the elements of style , &quot; &quot; she said she would treasure it .
and all this had come from nothing .
we would decide to establish this charter of compassion .
lorna and judith realized that kanner had been as wrong about autism being rare as he had been about parents causing it .
they knew what happened .
i hired guys who paint flats fixed on the sides of garages to do the painting on the building , and they loved it .
just this morning , we announced the open-source fundamental technologies you just saw in the video .
so for instance , what i did when i went to burundi , we &apos;d got tutsi and hutu women together to talk about some of the problems that had taken place in rwanda .
it got this query correct : &quot; &quot; a long , tiresome speech delivered by a frothy pie topping , &quot; &quot; and it quickly responded , &quot; &quot; what is a meringue harangue ? &quot; &quot; and jennings and the other guy didn &apos;t get that .
so , you ’ ll see there ’ s a problem here , something that is illogical .
indeed they would say religion is based on faith or maybe the calculus of pascal &apos;s wager .
without actually having to query them at all , we can get this kind of a structural insight .
how did you then make the decision and assume the responsibilities of running a newspaper , especially in such times of conflict ?
and yet , it feels natural to us now .
someone who has done something like this , however mediocre and throwaway , has tried something , has put something forward in public .
for someone who wants to cure diseases , there is no higher calling .
ryan holladay : blend seamlessly .
because not many people are really going to read archimedes in ancient greek , but they should have the chance to do it .
soap opera lesson three : evolution is real .
and on this curve , riding on moore &apos;s law , are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies available to all of us .
my first thought was , &quot; &quot; well , you know , there &apos;s george bush . &quot; &quot; but then i thought , &quot; &quot; why be rude to chimpanzees ? &quot; &quot; i guess there goes my green card .
ca : snowden said two days ago that terrorism has always been what is called in the intelligence world &quot; a cover for action , &quot; that it &apos;s something that , because it invokes such a powerful emotional response in people , it allows the initiation of these programs to achieve powers that an organization like yours couldn &apos;t otherwise have .
well , we &apos;re pretty sure that it &apos;s very small changes in the amount of sunlight reaching antarctica , just caused by natural changes in the orbit of the earth .
and i found myself , after two years there and performing and learning , on the island of bali , on the edge of a crater , gunung batur .
in 2003 , i started a project with computer scientist adam montandon , and the result , with further collaborations with peter kese from slovenia and matias lizana from barcelona , is this electronic eye .
i have occasional meetings with scientists .
so who would think that it was low-fat ?
even in the midst of terrible destruction and death and chaos , i learned how ordinary people could help their neighbors , share food , raise their children , drag someone who &apos;s being sniped at from the middle of the road even though you yourself were endangering your life , helping people get into taxis who were injured to try to take them to hospitals .
and this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences .
if you did , could you please raise your hand ?
i set out to write a compelling economic story , one that had great characters , that no one else was telling , and one that i thought mattered .
and a life that once seemed brief and insignificant revealed itself to be vital , everlasting and relevant .
just last year we realized that you don &apos;t even need to have a robotic device .
tb : good choice.ed : all right , thanks , dr. batiuk .
and it had drastic consequences .
one of those things you just saw flashed before you was a raven drone , the handheld tossed one . for about a thousand dollars , you can build one yourself , equivalent to what the soldiers use in iraq .
it &apos;s got these fishing lures on the bottom . they &apos;re going up and down .
and we should , now , be able to fly in here and have a closer look .
one of the really exciting things , though , is something that came out of the trip that i took to ghana just last month .
we &apos;re advising the burmese opposition , the government of southern sudan , which — you heard it here first — is going to be a new country within the next few years .
so let &apos;s look at what this last century has been to see where we &apos;re going .
this fish , 400 scales — again , it is one uncut square , only folding .
i mean , everything is scaling up very nicely and we &apos;re getting more confident .
and instead , they &apos;ll be planning for the future and starting to build the 22nd century enlightenment .
that &apos;s basically , if you hold two fists together , it &apos;s just slightly larger than the two fists .
and if they don &apos;t know which house to target , they &apos;ve been known to drive this technology around through whole neighborhoods .
quick snapshots of things you might see from a speeding motor scooter , and very slow walking through rome , you might be able to study in more detail some of the wonderful surfaces and whatnot that you come across .
and the only explanation i can have for some of what you &apos;ve been hearing in the last four days is that it arises , in fact , out of a form of love .
your brain works exactly the same way , responding to weight loss by using powerful tools to push your body back to what it considers normal .
each little box is about a billion dollars , and you see that i pay an awful lot of attention to nigeria sitting there in the middle .
they were men who had been contractors , or they had been building houses and they had lost their jobs after the housing boom , and they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support .
we in the lgbt community have gone from being a pathologized and reviled and criminalized group to being seen as part of the great human quest for dignity and equality .
( laughter ) ( applause ) from the drop-down menu , choose the first letter you want to type . ok . ( laughter )
and you can think of this as our satellite view for our map .
it &apos;s the idea of an ever-ever-land , emerging from an ancient civilization , united by a shared history , but sustained , above all , by pluralist democracy .
why don &apos;t you advise their government on their diplomacy ? &quot; &quot; and the kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service .
now in the top 10 cities in the u.s.
if you ask , what is the big difference between women and men physiologically ?
see any common themes ? principles ?
if , however , as in pasadena , every lane is a bike lane , then no lane is a bike lane .
we need to see how we can help those societies move from political coalitions , loosely based political coalitions , to civilizational coalitions that are working for the ideals and narratives of the democratic culture on the ground .
the first is , i think we need to question this idea that architecture is about making buildings .
stop trying to be good people .
and look at this whole range of cycle-based innovations : cycle that &apos;s a sprayer , cycle that generates energy from the shocks on the road .
so that was the reason for the project .
with my eyes shut . ha-ha .
these freckles are called sunspots , and they are just one of the manifestations of the sun &apos;s magnetic field .
so this shows the average relationship between gdp and social progress .
hold your phones up , hold your phones up !
if you do , would you mind if i timed how long it took you to walk down that hallway ?
sometimes we make food , too .
and that &apos;s going to pose an enormous problem .
before we were meant to travel , my mom came home one day , and said , &quot; we &apos;re going on a little holiday , a little trip . &quot;
so , this is a view of what humans are .
and so that &apos;s what we &apos;ll do today .
but after this , we have empirical evidence that 82 percent , on average , among all these villages — 1,200 villages have completed it — waterborne diseases have come down 82 percent .
so it was the fall of 1902 , and president theodore roosevelt needed a little break from the white house , so he took a train to mississippi to do a little black bear hunting outside of a town called smedes .
and we can use those lessons to craft our own life stories .
how do you get from trauma to growth ?
we filed the patent for her , the national innovation foundation .
so , people have commented on how , &quot; &quot; well , you know , you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of pandora . &quot; &quot; to me , it was more of a fundamental way of doing business , the process itself , that changed as a result of that .
i was adopted by the bishop of the episcopal diocese during the riots , and he donated a row house . and in that row house i started manchester craftsmen &apos;s guild , and i learned very quickly that wherever there are episcopalians , there &apos;s money in very close proximity .
now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic .
but it was like sex , you didn &apos;t have to be told .
and yet one more tap , and you &apos;d be &quot; &quot; liking &quot; &quot; auntie glenda on facebook .
and so i just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there , but you can fill in whatever you want . this is not a forecast .
and if nasa doesn &apos;t do it , china might , or somebody in this room might write a big check .
and what we know is that it &apos;s as if the bees have caught a flu .
see , second time for the same player .
all these women sitting at one table from eight , nine countries , all chatting to each other , not understanding a word , because they &apos;re all speaking a different language .
when we think about how we address problems in this country , we often start from a place of trickle-down justice .
arabs were saving jews . jews were saving arabs .
that &apos;s always been the harder problem when it comes to fighting wars .
and we know money is the root of all evil , but it didn &apos;t actually stop evil from happening in cambodia , in fact .
and it is his spirit and his optimism that is in my dna .
there were parades on veteran &apos;s day — there wasn &apos;t a president &apos;s day .
this is an image of me and my daughter holding the israeli flag .
we should have been , because it made a lot of smoke and it made a lot of noise , and it was powerful , you know .
the big plan was to ask him for a 1,000,000-dollar loan .
i mean , what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her ?
now , in fact , they couldn &apos;t do it for a lot of reasons today .
it &apos;s also fair to say that because it takes so many countries to agree to issue these extra sdrs , it &apos;s highly unlikely that money printing would get out of control .
it often takes a generation to accomplish , but it also requires us , today &apos;s generation , to take responsibility and to learn the right lessons about leadership , diplomacy and institutional design , so that the child soldiers of today can become the children of tomorrow .
so i &apos;m beginning to suspect that our specialization is beginning to impede our progress at best , and at worst , is leading us astray .
and no matter what i say , you cannot untie me from the mast .
it looks like this . this is the fifth prototype . it &apos;s not quite done .
ignore the instructions , that &apos;s what the government has to put in there to confuse you , i &apos;m sure .
we said , oh , kindergarten seems like a good place .
this is where it all comes from , and where these farmers who actually , ten thousand years ago , put us on the road of bread .
or — think about it — that 60,000 dollars is more than what it costs to send one person to harvard as well .
and we &apos;re also joined by brent lawson from lawson frisk securities .
we have nestlé creating nespresso , we have lego going into animated films , toyota creating the hybrids , unilever pushing into sustainability — there are lots of examples , and the benefits are huge .
we show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the united states and internationally .
i &apos;d grown five inches and done some 20,000 pushups in eight months , and the night before the crash , i delighted in my new body , playing basketball with friends into the wee hours of a may morning .
that &apos;s the idea of creativity .
and we have 26 elephants here , and our research is focused on the evolution of intelligence with elephants , but our foundation think elephants is focused on bringing elephants into classrooms around the world virtually like this and showing people how incredible these animals are .
a pattern is emerging and it says a lot more about us than it does about them .
and i went back to the u.n. for another couple of years .
they didn &apos;t ?
and each one of these forces split the world , tore the world apart , divided the world .
we use over five billion tons of coal , 30 billion-plus barrels of oil — that &apos;s a hundred million barrels a day .
we don &apos;t believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data , and i do understand that , i think we all do .
we make sure that the telemedicine platform gives access to expert medical specialists anywhere in the world , just by a click of the button .
i know you did because half of americans do every day .
i believe that what &apos;s mostly missing for nonviolence to grow is not for palestinians to start adopting nonviolence , but for us to start paying attention to those who already are .
so instead of having starch , which is the food of plants , it takes something rather similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate that it &apos;s burning fat , metabolizing , about the rate of a small cat .
( music ) i &apos;m a video game addict , and it &apos;s not because of a certain number of hours i have spent playing , or nights i have gone without sleep to finish the next level .
and i said , &quot; &quot; yes , i have a job . i write and illustrate children &apos;s books . &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; well , who pays you for that ? &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; no one , no one , no one just yet .
it was a gray november day , and i was overdue .
we used it in the 19th century to build art museums .
again , you can get the playback and personal contribution .
( applause ) they do lots of inconsistent things .
this is just an excerpt from one of those letters : &quot; &quot; my 12 year-old son has autism , and has had a terrible time with math .
the first time i met min , she had just turned 18 and quit her first job on the assembly line of an electronics factory .
and the stories that were captured of his life make up one of the crown jewels of histories , of human-lived experiences filled with ex-slaves .
i mean , it goes on in our private lives , too , every single day .
it &apos;s early , but i &apos;ve already , i &apos;ve got some lined up .
what can we do about this ? what are the solutions ?
most students think that it &apos;s boring or unwelcoming , so i have always designed projects following three principles .
ca : that &apos;s good .
now i don &apos;t expect every kid to be a farmer , but i expect you to read about it , write about it , blog about it , offer outstanding customer service .
you create your own reality , and you believe it .
has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles ?
that &apos;s why today we can use the files to get a better understanding of how a surveillance state functions .
actually , this was the first time i felt applause on the vest .
in a country of only seven million people , one and a half million were murdered by their own leaders , their bodies piled in the mass graves of the killing fields .
it &apos;s a horrific story . someone took a bottle of tylenol , put poison in it , closed it up , put it back on the shelf .
because we have real problems .
patient capital requires that we have incredible tolerance for risk , a long time horizon in terms of allowing those entrepreneurs time to experiment , to use the market as the best listening device that we have , and the expectation of below-market returns , but outsized social impact .
he wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my hopes and dreams .
can you come back next year and remind us again ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) some people say 9 / 11 heals the rift — jerks the long-term transformation gurus out of their 30,000 foot view of history , drags them down in to the muck and says , &quot; &quot; you want a networked opponent ?
here &apos;s our winner of the soprano solo .
amazing possibility .
and we get a lot of that .
so fine , we have a body clock , and it turns out that it &apos;s incredibly important in our lives .
removing the salts from water — particularly seawater — through reverse osmosis is a critical technique for countries who do not have access to clean drinking water around the globe .
i think that number &apos;s probably going to go up .
your world is ours . you — mt : as i was saying , besides the faces and bodies we give our robots , we cannot read their intentions , and that makes us nervous .
so i went searching when i started in this game to convince myself that there was any degree of plausibility to this whole crazy story .
so there are other examples , i &apos;m sure there are more to come .
if i show you 600 magazines and i divide them up into 10 categories , versus i show you 400 magazines and divide them up into 20 categories , you believe that i have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if i gave you the 400 than if i gave you the 600 .
the daf-2 hormone receptor is very similar to the receptor for the hormone insulin and igf-1 .
they constantly use the argument to devalue rap and modern pop , and these arguments completely miss the point , because the dam has burst .
and this is the number of people .
there &apos;s no major in university on passion and purpose and career .
this is in a broad assessment of their language abilities .
what we started to do was to realize that we had to take charge and reform ourselves .
by the end of the 20th century , it had become more than 15 clinicians for the same typical hospital patient — specialists , physical therapists , the nurses .
it &apos;s not obvious exactly what &apos;s going on .
so this is one that has been retrofitted in california .
not just the way we think about the world , but the way we are — our very biology .
first off , scientists have egos , and scientists like to name dinosaurs .
buckminster fuller was the kind of green guru — again , a word that had not been coined .
it allows us as owners to have other options .
the bear is a helpless victim tied to a tree , and the president of the united states decided to show it some mercy .
we call this comic book &quot; &quot; yes is more , &quot; &quot; which is obviously a sort of evolution of the ideas of some of our heroes .
you &apos;ll have japanese language classes every day to help you cope .
it is a treasure trove of botanical diversity .
we can &apos;t carefully control them because they &apos;re subconscious for us .
this sweet baby lars came to us directly from a hospital intensive care unit .
that day , i realized i had an unwelcome , uninvited , new life partner .
so in that picture , the x and the w are known , and the y is the unknown .
bg : if you project yourself — having done the research and having tried to get permission to start the trials , if you project yourself out in time , how many years before somebody gets into a hospital and this therapy is available ?
we are there to inspire , to provoke , to mobilize , to bring hope to our people .
and i cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see .
this is at uc santa barbara . look at these diatoms .
they &apos;ve been killed talking on the cell phone , laughing with friends , sitting in a car reported as stolen and making a u-turn in front of the white house with an infant strapped in the backseat of the car .
but if growth slows down , instead of doubling our standard of living every generation , americans in the future can &apos;t expect to be twice as well off as their parents , or even a quarter &#91; more well off than &#93; their parents .
so you needed women soldiers out there .
so a few of the stories .
and not long after i got my cochlear implant , i started learning how to play piano .
so the core of this reactor , since it &apos;s not under pressure and it doesn &apos;t have this chemical reactivity , means that there &apos;s no inclination for the fission products to leave this reactor .
but i also suspect that a fair number of those secretly despise religion as much as i do .
&quot; come on . this is our opportunity . &quot;
( applause ) ( applause ends ) they perform an extremely dynamic and collective maneuver to launch the ball back to me .
reading one of herschel &apos;s books was such a watershed moment for charles darwin that he would later say , &quot; &quot; scarcely anything in my life made so deep an impression on me .
we were ready to receive the caterpillars .
so while i &apos;m talking to you , the seats you are sitting on are currently emitting some invisible and odorless toxic gas . sorry for that . ( laughter ) so you are currently breathing formaldehyde .
so that &apos;s really the crux of the research , and to do that , we need to go one more step .
it &apos;s strong and resilient .
video : whoa ! ( laughter ) al gore : she &apos;s okay . the question is whether we will be .
i was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago .
and over time — quite rapidly actually , in a number of hours — we can build a physical product , ready to take out of the machine and use .
looks absolutely ridiculous .
so i want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot , and don &apos;t hesitate to go up to someone and ask , &quot; will you take our picture ? &quot;
chris anderson : this is such a strange thing .
one reviewer called elliott &apos;s story &quot; &quot; twitter fiction done right , &quot; &quot; because she did .
so they send them back in recent years .
this is when arms organization were able to link up , also financially , with each other .
and this is what we &apos;re doing in the lab at the moment .
this is the theme of my talk today .
brass nails tacked into the ebony wood , your face has been carved five times .
it &apos;s also crinkling the outer corner of the eye , the orbicularis oculi .
for example , we can look at a dna molecule model here .
but all of the people who i &apos;ve spoken to who have fallen foul of the law , they have all said , &quot; &quot; please , please give us a chance to work in the legitimate industry .
the husband , furious , threatens to kill the american .
but what you get out of such an exercise is simply a list of genes .
so i took him into a safe place .
however , not one of you got out of your seats to think , &quot; &quot; right ! how can i clap ? ok , maybe ... ( claps ) maybe i can use my jewelry to create extra sounds .
in fact , it appeared in a porno comic book , which is the slide on the right .
and if i succeed in doing that , maybe you would go back with the thought that you could build on , and perhaps help me do my work .
so i &apos;m announcing today the start of a new organization , or a new fund within the feed foundation , called the 30 project .
in countries where these people have no choice but to work in those fields , they simply do it and risk it .
why would we want to do it robotically ?
we can do things that rovers can &apos;t do and landers can &apos;t do : we can fly above mountains , volcanoes , impact craters ; we fly over valleys ; we can fly over surface magnetism , the polar caps , subsurface water ; and we can search for life on mars .
one is the question of education .
and one of the things that i think is important is that we have to get away from this idea of designing the machines manually , but actually let them evolve and learn , like children , and perhaps that &apos;s the way we &apos;ll get there . thank you .
this production was directed by south african artist and theater director , william kentridge .
it &apos;s one of the great questions of our time .
it &apos;s muffled english . it &apos;s degraded japanese .
are you sure he didn &apos;t graduate in the bottom 10 percent ?
we need human cells , but we need to find a way to keep them happy outside the body .
you see , when we speak of the big bang , we often have an image of a kind of cosmic explosion that created our universe and set space rushing outward .
i also think it &apos;s not that unlikely that governments might start taking an interest in genetic modification .
the first one , body-to-body transfer , yeah , with an outside mental architecture that i work with that they hold memory with for me .
they &apos;re flying and flashing their hearts out .
now we &apos;re not here for that long anyway , but to spend almost half of our life lost in thought and potentially quite unhappy , i don &apos;t know , it just kind of seems tragic , actually , especially when there &apos;s something we can do about it , when there &apos;s a positive , practical , achievable , scientifically proven technique which allows our mind to be more healthy , to be more mindful and less distracted .
and , over time , we started understanding and systematically researching what this tinkering ecosystem is about , because that is something that &apos;s happening not just in one street corner in mumbai .
we &apos;re not all in the same boat , and that means nobody &apos;s willing to sacrifice for the common good .
( applause )
this time it &apos;s sending the same message and link .
and this guy , he was up to a lot of no good .
continuing with the writings : &quot; &quot; the next morning i went to my professor &apos;s office to ask for an extension on the memo assignment , and i began gibbering unintelligably as i had the night before , and he eventually brought me to the emergency room .
so the design has a story .
my mother called and said she &apos;ll fly out .
firstly and most crucially , the lab coat wasn &apos;t white , it was in fact grey .
the list of candidate shapes has soared to about 10 to the 500 .
a friend pointed out to me that all of my big stories mirrored my own , each centering on a life that had changed in an instant , owing , if not to a crash , then to an inheritance , a swing of the bat , a click of the shutter , an arrest .
they &apos;re not going to wait for government to do things for them .
and this person , mr. ubirajara .
and again , if you move the obstacle a tiny bit , it &apos;ll again fall differently .
but there &apos;s tomatoes that end up in a soup , and as long as they meet the requirements of the food agency , there can be all kinds of things in there , no problem .
why did she say that ?
i &apos;d like to conclude with a project i &apos;ve been working on for two months .
and it &apos;s ok that i don &apos;t understand their social context .
we still haven &apos;t heard anything . we still haven &apos;t heard anything .
why does she receive more bites than i do ?
if you &apos;re cremated , all those toxins i mentioned are released into the atmosphere .
the two really critical questions that we need to address is how can we fix capitalism so that it can help create economic growth but at the same time can help to address social ills .
some of his favorites were moses , jesus , buddha , st. francis of assisi , gandhi — he adored his contemporary , gandhi .
the motivational component of compassion creates ambition for greater good .
and putting that data together — you can see the looting pits marked here .
well , one or two brave souls .
hg : seven . seven .
and when we are able to do that , what happens ?
i think we can do that in cambridge , &quot; &quot; brought it to cambridge and they started — two women — robin chase being the other person who started it .
now , we &apos;ve seen this can work with all forms of art — drawing , painting , collage — but what seems to have the most impact is mask-making .
i thought everybody had a job like that .
this is on the way home .
we &apos;re bringing our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of a story .
this second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
but he was still going like this .
&quot; twenty-seven ... a time of sudden revelations , &quot; &quot; sixty-two , ... of subtle diminishments . &quot;
our computer algorithm is very accurate , much more accurate than humans can be , and it &apos;s not going to be accurate all the time .
and we did . and it was play .
it &apos;s only an attitude .
( laughter ) yeah , it &apos;s a — this one here , that &apos;s much better .
the hub , ironically enough , is centered in little roanoke , virginia .
no single narrative serves the needs of everyone everywhere .
these different blocks represent the different viruses in this paramyxovirus family , so you can kind of go down the blocks and see where the signal is .
( laughter ) there are people who had choice , like pastor andré trocmé and his wife , and the whole village of le chambon-sur-lignon in france .
you see , because both the paradigms are human constructions .
the content doesn &apos;t matter anymore , the problem is the media .
at : well , we are also looking at that because in the event that nothing comes forward from the international community , we are preparing , we don &apos;t want to be caught like what &apos;s happening in europe .
he actually made 20 dollars more than that , but he didn &apos;t count it .
i vaguely knew this was to be the last of the moon missions , but i was absolutely certain there would be mars colonies in my lifetime .
so i went about my business : paragon space development corporation , a little firm i started with people while i was in the biosphere , because i had nothing else to do .
what they had was better teamwork , and they showed that a team of humans and computers , working together , could beat any computer or any human working alone .
we have to choose that path .
the results ?
and this wasn &apos;t just an abstract question .
the ranges of stuff — the red line is the mass extinction .
what words would you describe yourself with ?
why is that ? are you too tired to go all the way around ?
i &apos;m sorry if i put that idea in your head .
imagine you wake up with this terrible bellyache , you go to the hospital , you &apos;re lying in this strange place , you &apos;re on this hospital gurney , you &apos;re wearing this flimsy gown , strangers are coming to poke and prod at you .
what if a small part of that next healthcare workforce were the 11 million college students in this country ?
the second is observing people in real-life situations and empathizing with them .
well , really , just change your perspective .
besides , if you continue to act like an artist as you get older , you &apos;ll increasingly feel pressure — people will question your actions and ask you to act properly .
unfortunately for her , the anchor line gets tangled around the feet of some boy scouts who are visiting the pantheon , and they are immediately yanked out and given an extraordinary but terrifying tour of some of the domes of rome , which would , from their point of view , naturally be hanging upside down .
you talk about what you want .
not just where you attach a micro-controller to the end point , but that the structure and the mechanisms are the logic , are the computers .
the point about democracy is not instrumental .
all human beings are legal persons .
what can we do with just one person &apos;s data ? what can we do
she used to tell us , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m fine with my crooked smile and with my numbness in my face .
in particular , it then becomes possible for a competitor in one business to use their position in one step of the value chain in order to penetrate or attack or disintermediate the competitor in another .
every row across here represents one of those 11 zones .
no . i think he &apos;s trying to say that jealousy reveals us to ourselves .
this is how it looks today ; all traffic jam .
opportunity is the gift within every gift , and we have this saying , opportunity knocks only once .
and so the industry has spent over 100 million dollars specifically on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house .
these people actually believe — and they have no contact among them , no common language or anything , so it &apos;s not an idea that spread , it &apos;s an idea that &apos;s arisen around the world — they believe that a fetus is literally made of accumulated semen .
now we believe that spacetime and objects are the nature of reality as it is .
because fielders are successful 90 to 95 percent of the time .
this is now a little tiny patch .
this is purely hypothetical , i can assure you .
so , when we did this for responses from the standard method and from our encoder and transducer .
it was the eve of the gulf war and i organized a global campaign to flood the hotel , the intercontinental in geneva , where james baker and tariq aziz were meeting on the eve of the war , and i thought if i could flood them with faxes , we &apos;ll stop the war .
it &apos;s a very deep-water part of our planet .
and i still suffer , because my son is like he &apos;s buried alive .
will the number of children increase each year up to 15 years , or will it continue in the same fast rate and be four billion children up there ?
it would hardly do to eat your baby or your lover .
and he &apos;s not the only one in the world .
oxygen concentrators are very old technology . what is new , and what we will have in a few months , i hope , is that ability to use this same renewable energy system to provide and produce oxygen on site . zeolite — it &apos;s not new — zeolite removes nitrogen from air and nitrogen is 78 percent of air .
they have to deal with things like toxins and pharmaceuticals that are flushed out into the ocean , and maybe even affecting their reproduction .
and that &apos;s kind of what has been the spirit of what we are doing .
he went around once , he went around twice , he went around thrice .
when it got to the supreme court in 2013 , the supreme court agreed , and doma was thrown out .
one , i can take my grandmother &apos;s advice and sort of least-expect my way into maybe bumping into the one out of 35 possible men in the entire 1.5-million-person city of philadelphia , or i could try online dating .
and i would like to share with you a launch .
in fact , one of his classmates is a young man named lenin who would go on to break small , expensive , exquisite objects .
that happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity that the world can now make every year — a number that goes up 60 or 70 percent a year .
just scuttle forward and go for it . &quot; &quot; and so i now want to show you a short video of what happened there on the ice .
whenever you work on that level , things behave different .
( laughter ) engage a company having prior successes for human factors engineering and industrial design to optimize the design of the first portable tms device that will be sold to the patients who have migraine headaches .
this is what i spoke about in the last ted .
and i would love to tell you the answer , but i &apos;m running out of time .
what percentage lived in a house with a bomb shelter ?
( chanting ) jennifer : a soldier walked onto the road , asking where we &apos;d been .
we have to address problems at the root , and when you deal with what &apos;s happening in black communities , it creates an effervescence , right ?
and it was all the people who lived in those homes , were the ones that were actually taking it apart and working , and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart .
what this means is that , if the police seize an iphone and it has a password , they &apos;ll have a difficult time getting any data off of it , if they can do it at all .
what about the idea of the plurality of the worlds , about life on other planets ?
in fact , a head of state that you &apos;re all familiar with admitted this to me . and it &apos;s really true .
( applause ) bruno giussani : jocelyne , this is amazing , and i &apos;m sure that right now , there are several dozen people in the audience , possibly even a majority , who are thinking , &quot; &quot; i know somebody who can use this . &quot; &quot; i do , in any case .
we teamed up with an amazing cadre of black barbers and taught them how to measure blood pressure and how to counsel their customers and refer them to doctors to help manage high blood pressure .
it was hunted to death for its feathers .
right now on the horn of africa , we &apos;ve been through this before .
i ’ m going to see how many of you at the back of the room can actually get those things onto the stage .
dd : this is something i call &quot; &quot; swinging in the rain . &quot; &quot; and you can barely see it , but it &apos;s — a controller at top cycles the water to fall just before and after you pass through the bottom of the arc .
it felt as if my brain was trying to kill me , and then , being afraid of being afraid consumed all of my thoughts .
so we have to have a change in consciousness .
and the question still remains : what can individuals , organizations and governments do ?
i don &apos;t think they know that , luckily , but i would go back and play for arby &apos;s coupons .
we were about 11,000 people living here .
on this side , there &apos;s a different experience .
i went to a video terminal connected to harvard &apos;s time-sharing system and got to work .
it &apos;s actually just happened here — light to dark in six seconds .
these rules , they come from game theory and organizational sociology .
so i cannot tell a happy story about these social trends , and they don &apos;t show any signs of reversing themselves .
let me give you some examples from a couple of areas which i think we all care about : health and education .
on the left , you can see the sub1 variety , and on the right is the conventional variety .
okay , 30 years ago we were coming out of the &apos; 70s .
i never saw any poor man , any black .
and what our collaborators have done is to image little pieces of brain tissue .
so when i die , the infinity mushrooms will recognize my body and be able to eat it .
thank you .
these are the dispensers . there &apos;s this friendly shape .
the answers happen to be pairs of numbers , so you can draw them on this two-dimensional plot .
it &apos;s quite the opposite , that the urge to take control of all possible futures is a more fundamental principle than that of intelligence , that general intelligence may in fact emerge directly from this sort of control-grabbing , rather than vice versa .
i don &apos;t have a clitoris .
it &apos;s called saying &quot; &quot; yes , and &quot; &quot; to the offers made by other actors .
so it &apos;s a real desert for not only for the penguins and the sea lions and the marine iguanas ...
( applause )
i wanted to know what was going on with the reactor , what was going on with the radiation , whether my family was in danger .
so , here we are , a week after the olympics and down at atlanta , and i &apos;m just blown away by the fact that just a year ago , i got out on a gravel track and couldn &apos;t run 50 meters .
it isn &apos;t some cultic thing . ( laughter ) it &apos;s just , it &apos;s just , i just would like us all to go there .
she is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of american letters .
i like to quote because i think dead people shouldn &apos;t be excluded from the conversation .
but if you look at cultures which have cyclical and based on infinite lives , you will see a comfort with fuzzy logic , with opinion , with contextual thinking , with everything is relative , sort of — ( laughter ) mostly . ( laughter )
and indeed , i was very far from the mark .
why ? because in compassion , when we feel with the other , we dethrone ourselves from the center of our world and we put another person there . and once we get rid of ego , then we &apos;re ready to see the divine .
but now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess .
how can we understand what makes some societies more fragile than other societies ? the problem is obviously relevant to our situation today , because today as well , there are some societies that have already collapsed , such as somalia and rwanda and the former yugoslavia . there are also societies today that may be close to collapse , such as nepal , indonesia and columbia .
they &apos;re taking information from our planet at very critical places like antarctica and the poles .
it &apos;s a commercial black box .
and i think every human , we all have different genetic backgrounds , we all have lived separate lives .
you can be eight feet tall . just take them off . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) he didn &apos;t find it as humorous as i did , anyway .
there &apos;s georgian buildings around the side .
this particular classroom happens to be in the state of michoacan .
so , for the last 5 years , i &apos;ve been taking pads of this paper , tons of this stuff , and smuggling it into the stationery supplies of the united states and the coalition governments .
most of our current voters and politicians have no personal experience of any of those things , but millions of older americans do .
this is the sort of 3d data that a machine will read .
and it &apos;s through the sharing that people get tactics of how to take care of themselves , how to disclose how to take medicines .
and even that was considered outrageous at the time .
and then what happens is , when they put the marshmallow on the top , they run out of time and what happens ?
neither have i provided electricity to my village through sheer ingenuity .
i teach courses in physical computing and wearable electronics .
( laughter ) you see , psychokinesis is the paranormal influence of the mind on physical events and processes .
( video ) voice : onicha , off to school with your brother .
then some people had a much harder policy , and this was very similar to the cmu policy , that it had to have eight characters including uppercase , lowercase , digit , symbol , and pass a dictionary check .
so , you &apos;ll be on mars , and you &apos;re at hellespointica depressio which has got to be a really &quot; &quot; up &quot; &quot; place .
everybody else at the time of google , more or less , was trying to be a portal .
it initially started off with me stacking these things , bunches of them , and then playing with the sense of space , of filling in the space . and then it started changing , and become folding on themselves .
now these are examples of new orleans rebuilding in this way , but better if others act proactively with these changes in mind .
and so the waiting is really the hardest part .
and here you can see a subject having phosphorus makeup stippled on her face .
and you know , i don &apos;t say that i do everything well , i just say that i do a lot of things , that &apos;s all .
he didn &apos;t even try to do those things .
we spend 200 billion dollars a year on diet-related illness today , with nine percent of our kids having type 2 diabetes .
their complexity , their sophistication , is something to really marvel at , and i think it &apos;s really the scandal of the human genome project .
the child &apos;s symptoms begin with mild fever , headache , muscle pains , followed by vomiting and diarrhea , then bleeding from the mouth , nose and gums .
this — i &apos;ve shown you sea floor — but so the goal here is real time interaction with the oceans from anywhere on earth .
instead of being the sole guardian of information , be a facilitator to all this information .
they gave us endotracheal aspirate — you know , a little fluid from the throat , from this tube that they got down there — and they gave us this .
so , again , this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to is really starting to catch on .
and so uberpool is a very great solution for urban carpooling .
we live in the dusk of an era .
wow . she is a gorgeous embodiment of youthful sexuality .
and then , they learned how to read the letters for the code .
but it was in this environment of political catharsis that the country was going through that it had to do with politics , indeed , but it had to do also with a new way of organizing , through a new way of communicating .
jason then asked us , &quot; &quot; what happens when you open the box and hope isn &apos;t there ? &quot; &quot; he paused a few moments , leaned to his right , and was gone .
the first one is that i don &apos;t believe women are inherently or essentially more peaceful than men .
so , you pour them out onto a surface and they start to stick to that surface , and we take a picture using an atomic-force microscope .
it &apos;s activated when one recognizes cartoons , when one draws cartoons , and when one hallucinates them .
now , actually , he gave the test before the drugs and after the drugs , to see what the difference was in people ’ s facility and speed with coming up with ideas .
i used the galvanize and copper in a very light gauge , so it would buckle .
i was sure of it .
but it can go beyond data , and it can go beyond numbers .
she &apos;s hugging the purse .
and this has become part of our toolkit for being able to look and see where the activities are in the data , and with it , trace the pattern of , in particular , where my son moved throughout the home , so that we could focus our transcription efforts , all of the speech environment around my son — all of the words that he heard from myself , my wife , our nanny , and over time , the words he began to produce .
who cares about syria ? who cares about bosnia ?
how they even got the cameras to capture some of this , i couldn &apos;t tell you .
ph : oh , but then he remembers he works for rupert murdoch .
this is the kid who shot up virginia tech .
and what &apos;s striking though , is that in society there &apos;s almost nothing comparable , no comparable investment , no systematic experiment , in the things capitalism isn &apos;t very good at , like compassion , or empathy , or relationships or care .
it costs a lot of money , a lot of time , and sometimes , even when a drug hits the market , it acts in an unpredictable way and actually hurts people .
and also i gave that talk exactly a month ago , and you can see it at ted.com.
and of course , they &apos;re not always crying and screaming , but with three boys , there &apos;s a decent probability that at least one of them will not be comporting himself exactly as he should .
now , this isn &apos;t just academic .
molecular animations are unparalleled in their ability to convey a great deal of information to broad audiences with extreme accuracy .
stephen hawking : there is one , and only one , arrangement in which the pieces make a complete picture .
and it will be terrible when they come for everyone , but particularly for people like us plutocrats .
that meant they were the most callous and the most aggressive of the entire prison population .
mk : well , when we met , oddly enough , it was the last time we were in vancouver , about 10 years ago . we met in vancouver , at the airport , on a trip that we were both taking to china , that i would actually , from my background , i would call it a boondoggle .
in fact , that was a piece by beethoven , and so i was not functioning as a composer .
this is what the internet looked like when it was born and you can call that the internet of middle-aged white men , mostly middle-aged white men .
and perhaps it &apos;s time we started to explore those , in the context of future mars and the moon exploration .
and it doesn &apos;t have to be an act of weakness .
some of them are political . many of them are physical .
but the cool thing is that , if you look in the embryo , as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand .
( applause )
even if you only cared about aids in africa , it might still be a good idea to invest in malaria , in combating poor indoor air quality , in improving maternal mortality rates .
you see , in america , even the second coming of christ has a vip section .
and you can see certain biases that come up again and again .
ferdinand : beyond all limit .
i remember how i was glued to the screens , anxiously following the news .
that &apos;s a foolish choice . it &apos;s foolish , just like trying to choose between being realistic or idealistic .
well , it &apos;s mostly true .
and anytime i would get a letter from my son , it was like a ray of light in the darkest place you can imagine .
and i shut that part down .
and there &apos;s no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas — it &apos;s just doing some very simple things .
he was 18 .
they not only handle all the male extroverts , they pick up a few introverts as well .
it &apos;s just a series of variations on the head of the duke of montefeltro , who &apos;s a great , great figure in the renaissance , and probably the basis for machiavelli &apos;s &quot; &quot; the prince . &quot; &quot; he apparently lost an eye in battle , which is why he is always shown in profile .
that &apos;s what happened when the robots actually are rewarded for doing something .
and this challenges yet another assumption , which is that organized philanthropy is only for the very wealthy .
now , most researchers believe obesity is the cause of insulin resistance .
and so by reading the genome , we can find out much more about your family than you probably know .
i think engaging mycelium can help save the world .
what can you do that is more responsible than what you &apos;re doing now ?
so what is missing or underrepresented ?
it &apos;s actually a children &apos;s song but like so many projects for children it &apos;s really just a trojan horse for adult work .
but such people , compelled to the east india company , which came here for business , a very dirty kind of business ...
and so the whole idea here was to create that kind of space in downtown , in a neighborhood that was difficult to fit into .
and everywhere too , you can see a proliferation of time banks and parallel currencies , people using smart technologies to link up all the resources freed up by the market — people , buildings , land — and linking them to whomever has got the most compelling needs .
they get fit together , and then they compete .
and i &apos;d heard this before as well .
in india it was just impossible to paste .
this is not the place for hate and anger .
have you been watching the commercials ?
the question , though , is not &quot; &quot; why can &apos;t we ? &quot; &quot; the question is how can we help africans do this for themselves ?
that &apos;s how we met . ( laughter ) you tell them . ( laughter ) nm : you want to or no ? ( laughter ) well i guess i have to now .
i love this idea that came from the village level : three keys to unlock that warehouse .
i observed as it networked .
we &apos;re not dead . we &apos;re fine . we &apos;re fine . &quot; &quot; and the doctor was , in fact , checking us to make sure we were , in fact , fine .
we need to be thinking more about permaculture , which is why i think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing .
tc : yes .
three years later , i found out how wrong i was .
we had our own half-acre farm that we had to grow everything .
and to cap it all , brand royalty — agusta , count agusta , from the great histories of this stuff .
thank you .
now , for a system to function autonomously , it must collectively know the location of its mobile objects in space .
here &apos;s one of his bestselling books .
now a lot of people have given up on government .
so i have tried to target on where we use the natural gas .
they don &apos;t make anyone safer .
well , i have to tell you something very odd , and that is that being exposed to low oxygen does not always kill .
if we know what it takes to have a healthcare system rather than a sick-care system , why don &apos;t we just do it ?
some days it goes up and some days it doesn &apos;t go up . &quot; &quot; no . it goes up whenever i damn well want it to .
how many have got opportunity like me to go to u.s. , do a master &apos;s ?
the &quot; &quot; 1812 overture &quot; &quot; isn &apos;t worth waking for .
the svalbard global seed vault is a wonderful gift that norway and others have given us , but it &apos;s not the complete answer .
( music ) so many of you know that that &apos;s beethoven &apos;s seventh symphony .
so why is it that we move the particular ways we do ?
this was done in japan and in the u.s. , published at the same time , and it rebooted skin cells into stem cells , last year .
it is a story about the fact that everybody has a name , everybody has a story , everybody is someone .
the reward may be big .
so i thought about it , i wrote my 50 words , and a few weeks later , chris called and said , &quot; &quot; go for it . &quot; &quot; so here is my wish : that you will help us take everything we &apos;ve learned through storycorps and bring it to the world so that anyone anywhere can easily record a meaningful interview with another human being which will then be archived for history .
we vanquished it . puff .
okay , well , it &apos;s what i can do with some household tinfoil .
this is opportunity . this is spirit .
we have this incredible excess capacity .
we &apos;re worried about who might be watching us .
we can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing .
in my opinion , these people are much more wiser than , not only the political elite , even the intellectual elite , even opposition leaders including political parties .
look carefully : this is slowed down 100 times , and watch what it &apos;s doing with the rest of its leg .
i &apos;m a guy that works with business , helps business make money .
they have lost .
these are the rovers up here that you have on mars now .
and when evolutionary biologists talk about design , they really mean design by natural selection .
and they &apos;re not quite what you might expect from our marble monument .
i was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else , and i started to notice a distinct pattern — that the recession was affecting men much more deeply than it was affecting women .
she said , &quot; &quot; but what i worry about the most is not any of that .
but then she was beheaded , so never mind her as a role model .
each one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay , and it was the imperfections that people cherished .
now these chimpanzees are using tools , and we take that as a sign of their intelligence .
obviously , we hope that the strike is — that the issues are resolved as quickly as possible .
ss : this is kanzi and i , in the forest .
well , we know that they can roll balls in a straight line using celestial cues .
great dreams aren &apos;t just visions , they &apos;re visions coupled to strategies for making them real .
this is colonel picquart .
and finally number 10 , last and certainly not least , ranjani shettar , who lives and works here in the state of karnataka , creates ethereal sculptures and installations that really marry the organic to the industrial , and brings , like subodh , the local global .
they were just beyond our sights .
our goal was to change the negative image of arab-americans in media , while also reminding casting directors that south asian and arab are not synonymous .
i have always wanted to travel back in time to an era where maps were mostly blank or they read , &quot; &quot; there be dragons . &quot; &quot; and today , the closest i &apos;ve come is visiting remote atolls in the western indian ocean .
so a fair criticism — is what it is — of second life today is that it &apos;s more like the wild west than it is like rome , from a cultural standpoint .
older people really wanted to leave the european union .
so , imagine we &apos;re in the middle of america .
i made a film that was impossible to make , but i didn &apos;t know it was impossible , and that &apos;s how i was able to do it .
people are now confident to bring — if your people in the diaspora bring their money back , it shows other people that , look , there is emerging confidence in your country .
( laughter ) we grew up playing a bunch of , we played by ear and i think that &apos;s important for us because we were not really exposed to a lot of different styles of music .
but this last time , just coming round , right now , suddenly , there &apos;d be huge changes in the environment , in the concentration of people , and it was just unbelievable , the amount of — all the change in it .
leading innovation is not about creating a vision , and inspiring others to execute it .
so the question was , i started looking at this issue , and going back and forth between bangladesh and new york .
and then you can also engage the end user in the design process , and not just ask him what he needs , but ask him how he thinks it can be achieved .
but deng xiaoping instinctively understood the importance of offering choices to his people .
how will it be a knowledge society ?
and i want to actually use a robot here — a robot named chris — stand up . yeah . okay .
and one of my heroes , aphex twin , famously hid in dark corners of clubs .
now , the conceptual issues are truly profound when you talk about creativity and ownership and , let me tell you , we don &apos;t want to leave this just to lawyers to figure out .
i was fortunate also , to meet the man who &apos;s sitting on the bed , though i gave him hair over here and he doesn &apos;t have hair .
i can talk to you over it without worrying about what we in fact now know is happening , without worrying about the fact that not only will surveillance be happening but it &apos;ll be done by people who may abuse the data .
and , kind of as a way of surviving , i would go into my own very personal space , and i would make things .
and now &#91; these &#93; new elements of human intolerance for river creatures like the gharial means that if they don &apos;t drown in the net , then they simply cut their beaks off .
this is a scarf toy , and i &apos;m trying to lead the dolphin over to the keyboard to show her the visual and the acoustic signal .
now this piece is currently in process — due out in may — but what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve put together a small demo , just to show the geometric translation of points into a sphere .
i had a family friend who for years used to call my girlfriend my lover .
and , as well , as of efficacy , agency .
they were doing fine .
einstein : &#91; coughs &#93; sw : yeah .
so my breakfast , my lunch , i donate it to a charity that i founded because we want to build a school in sudan .
so it &apos;s never been easier to cheat , and it &apos;s never been more difficult to keep a secret .
last year , this group was able to take all the cells off a heart , leaving just the cartilage .
that &apos;s pretty good too .
a nurse in a busy clinic will see 50 to 100 patients in a day , which leaves her just minutes per patient — minutes per patient .
ipaidabribe.com is really important , a good one to log on to and see .
my kids are seven , who the hell knows .
if i want a spinning tail , let &apos;s grab a motor , put some play-dough on it , stick it on and we have spinning .
can the mothers lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed that will make their future offspring less sick ?
it &apos;s easy to forget that because of its short life , the internet has actually changed many times over the last 30 years or so .
i would like break the walls of ignorance between east and west — no , not the soft option that we have discussed before , but rather the soft power that joseph nye has spoken about before .
but as soon as i get to a place of real quiet , i realize that it &apos;s only by going there that i &apos;ll have anything fresh or creative or joyful to share with my wife or bosses or friends .
let &apos;s see how we can bring people back to the process .
so if life could be established out there , it would have all the essentials — chemistry and sunlight — everything that &apos;s needed .
during the 1918 flu pandemic 50 million people died .
so , parabiosis is done in mice by surgically connecting the two mice together , and that leads then to a shared blood system , where we can now ask , &quot; &quot; how does the old brain get influenced by exposure to the young blood ? &quot; &quot; and for this purpose , we use young mice that are an equivalency of 20-year-old people , and old mice that are roughly 65 years old in human years .
no one to figure out what tools should be used .
the demands of modern institutional thinking is coming in .
but i &apos;m not ashamed of my self .
she goes back to reading her book , which is unfortunately titled &quot; &quot; rape . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so she &apos;s noticed the unusual thing , but she &apos;s gone back to her normal life .
i &apos;m from pittsburgh , pennsylvania .
it &apos;s political . there is so many parties to this project .
and do you know what all of them have in common ?
but the shooting day would end , and i &apos;d return to my gnarly , awkward self .
ca : was there a sense from them of a narrative that things were kind of tough and bad , or was there a narrative of some kind of level of growth , that things over time were getting better ?
and then i dressed up as no-face from &quot; &quot; spirited away . &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t know about &quot; &quot; spirited away &quot; &quot; and its director , hayao miyazaki , first of all , you &apos;re welcome .
so it &apos;s conceivable , if god were to exist , he might wonder , i &apos;m eternal , i &apos;m all-powerful , but where did i come from ?
and the object itself invited exploration interaction , consideration and touch .
and the genetic information is contained in the form of a sequence of four bases abbreviated with the letters a , t , c and g.
count thy sheep and not thy years .
this was a bad idea , because philip of macedon had a son called alexander the great , and they lost the battle of chaeronea .
so go to the beach and start again on monday .
zipcar buys cars and parks them throughout dense metropolitan areas for people to use , by the hour and by the day , instead of owning their own cars .
and the thing is , we could ask for help — asking for help &apos;s not that hard .
i get to see the most incredible architecture , see stunning sculptures — i mean , this is basically a selfie in stone — and see that we &apos;ve always rocked serious bling .
mia birdsong : why is black lives matter important for the us right now and in the world ?
and it wasn &apos;t an inclusive group .
you can see , in her case , she &apos;s wearing her transducer arrays , one of the front of her chest , one on the back , and then the second pair side-to-side over the liver .
and he &apos;s brought the internet and satellite technology to the forest — both so that people themselves could monitor the deforestation , but also that he could speak from the forest to the rest of the world .
we &apos;ll never see through it , it &apos;s opaque to light .
he asked the question , if i take that material , which is a natural material that usually induces healing in the small intestine , and i place it somewhere else on a person &apos;s body , would it give a tissue-specific response , or would it make small intestine if i tried to make a new ear ?
it &apos;s true .
but you probably don &apos;t know that much about james watt .
and then he started clapping .
because we are reactive to the heightened venom of the political debate , you get governments that have an us-versus-them mentality , tiny groups of people making decisions .
but not too long ago , i came upon this on the web .
change happens slowly .
and that if we don &apos;t do that , the antithesis , although we &apos;ve heard otherwise , is we &apos;re really going to become extinct , because we &apos;re feeding our children to death .
so are we all .
and isn &apos;t it that strange moment when you publish your design ?
so if you think from the perspective of early metastatic cancer cells as they &apos;re out searching around for the resources that they need , if those resources are clustered , they &apos;re likely to use interactions for recruitment , and if we can figure out how cancer cells are recruiting , then maybe we could set traps to catch them before they become established .
so we need to think about , as was spoken earlier , the traditional african methods for doing self-organization .
the governments that are making the most progress are the governments that have found ways to enable shared value in business rather than see government as the only player that has to call the shots .
&quot; hello world , hello berlin , hello nsa , hello gchq . &quot;
and then this funny thing happened .
even more exciting .
i want to say that i think the powers that be know that empire-building is actually — that feelings get in the way of empire-building .
for most of the past 114 years , everyone , including scientists , mistakenly confused alzheimer &apos;s with aging .
( applause )
however , the inequalities that exist between richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding pose a real risk for exploitation , especially in the context of externally-funded research .
this is the story of my brother .
so let me talk a little bit about why we need to do that , because our global commons is under attack in a variety of ways , and none of the sources of threat to the global commons will be solved by building walls .
there &apos;s a lot to talk about in this chart .
there &apos;s no suggestion of a relationship there .
i &apos;m going to have a sandwich for lunch .
i had other dreams , not necessarily practical ones , but at the age of eight , i was bequeathed a guitar .
here &apos;s a clue .
and it takes weeks to perform our integrations .
no one &apos;s going to notice those split lines and changes .
institutions hate being told they &apos;re obstacles .
( laughter ) but here &apos;s how i think i like to make change , and that is in making connections .
so i grab the dove , and for the second time i send her in the air .
it means it gets filled with hot air .
it &apos;s the same with a wheat field , it &apos;s the same with a rice field .
but what if you could read your ex &apos;s emails , or add a couple zeros to your bank account .
one is that they &apos;re highly prevalent .
those flags represented the countries from which my team came from .
it &apos;s full of us , it &apos;s full of our stuff , full of our waste , full of our demands .
generally a duty of care arises when one individual or a group of individuals undertakes an activity which has the potential to cause harm to another , either physically , mentally or economically .
but instead the entire team creates a shared mental model that they can all agree on and move forward on .
and all of the items on it are unremarkable .
what &apos;s special about it ?
( laughter ) and i expect to speak in the first session of the 39th ted india .
this doesn &apos;t bother me so much , that the underlying darwinian rationale of compassion is kind of self-serving at the genetic level .
but most of us , i think , accept some small role for the state to enforce a duty of care , and the key word here is reasonable .
now , you don &apos;t see these devices as add-ons for phones yet , but students and engineers around the world have attached atmospheric sensors to bicycles and handheld computers and cheap robots and the backs of pigeons — that being a project that &apos;s actually underway right now at u.c. irvine , using bird-mounted sensors as a way of measuring smog-forming pollution .
and the one in mono , by the way , he used the pedal , and as he got older , he said , &quot; &quot; no , no , wait a minute .
( laughter ) now , i think this is totally obvious , but the very obviousness of it raises what is for me an incredibly profound question .
she worried that the violence we witnessed would overtake our lives ; that our poverty meant that the neighbors with whom we lived and shared space would harm us .
disc1 is a gene that &apos;s deleted in schizophrenia .
i love to cook , i hosted many dinner parties , and in return , people invited me to their dinner parties , and to their barbecues , and to their pool parties , and to their birthday parties .
it &apos;s a bit suspicious isn &apos;t it ? there is two answers to the question so far , zero and one .
and it &apos;s sort of one of the other groups of people who pay a price for us .
and based on my prior sighted experience , it sounds like a pretty cool city , whether you &apos;re blind , whether you have a disability , or you haven &apos;t quite found yours yet .
and everybody ran up to me .
but the types of results that can be produced are undeniable .
so , three years ago , i got together with some friends of mine who had similar aspirations and we founded genspace .
she didn &apos;t recognize me — there was no recognition whatsoever .
the level is dropping , rather like the aral sea .
ruby taught me that you &apos;re not supposed to be afraid of the bugs under your bed .
the space between buildings will be well-balanced between people and cars .
the most important thing is to be a mensch . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) thank you . ( applause ) ( applause )
but are they really ?
( music ) ( applause )
with income down there and child mortality .
the dalai lama often states that compassion is his best friend .
by the way , this is something that really bothers me .
( laughter ) but not to create the engineering colleges .
i used a gps to get here today , and this is my hometown .
he &apos;s an austrian school economist who was first active in the first half of the 20th century in vienna .
in fact , it &apos;s hard .
and people say , &quot; &quot; oh , well , you &apos;ve launched this thing , and it &apos;s radioactive , into space , and what about accidents ? &quot; &quot; but we launch plutonium batteries all the time .
so if you look at the green data points , which is air that &apos;s outside , you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s a large amount of microbial diversity , or variety of microbial types .
so the one thing , though , that i want you to remember about this is that these patterns of interactions are something that you &apos;d expect to be closely connected to colony size .
this is a left-in , right-out , left-in , center-out and tie .
in our system , whether you &apos;re detained or free , pending trial is not a matter of how dangerous you are or how much of a flight risk you pose .
and yet i see it as something that &apos;s just as basic for survival — long term — as learning some of the basic things about public health .
and lo and behold , we found that we could do it .
work with advice that works for your family .
in your time , scientists thought humans could replace organs and extend life for hundreds of years .
it is really in this sense of discovery that i have a new set of questions that i &apos;m asking .
and i had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it .
it &apos;s called crispr-cas9 .
i said , &quot; &quot; tell me about the men and women who painted these . &quot; &quot; and he looked at me absolutely askance , and he said , &quot; women didn &apos;t paint these pictures . &quot;
i gave a talk like this in london a while back about this point . i said , as i say to all of you , i &apos;m on facebook . friend me .
why isn &apos;t the title of the show , &apos; a black woman got the job ? &apos; or &apos; a black woman got a job ? &apos; &quot; &quot; because without confronting men &apos;s sense of entitlement , i don &apos;t think we &apos;ll ever understand why so many men resist gender equality .
very soon , the same systems that we use today to bring music and entertainment and gps information into our vehicles are going to be used to create a smart vehicle network .
so even though you are blind , you can put your hand over it , you can see the lanes of the road and obstacles .
we use four million cups a day on airline flights , and virtually none of them are reused or recycled .
i mean , people — pamela anderson has more prosthetic in her body than i do .
i had closed all the curtains in the apartment , so in the middle of the day the apartment was in near total darkness .
so , for example , the middle line there , 0.1 watts per square meter , is the energy consumption per unit area of saudi arabia , norway , mexico in purple , and bangladesh 15 years ago .
and two years after this photo was taken , she passed away , and i attended her wake , and nothing could have prepared me for what i saw there , because next to her casket was this painting , and her husband told me it meant so much to her that i had acknowledged her hard work , i had validated what she did .
the state still matters .
as usual , there &apos;s a dozen kids there waiting to get picked up , but this time , the children &apos;s faces look weirdly similar , and you can &apos;t figure out which child is yours .
for instance , the tunnel diode , a component used in electronics , works thanks to the wonders of quantum tunneling .
try to imagine what the surface of titan might look like .
and these guys paint humongous paintings , and they look really good .
and it exists with the educated urban class , also .
and the way it works is , it comes from the southwest .
( applause ) bruno giussani : harry , even if you just said the science may not have some answers , i would like to ask you a couple of questions , and the first is : building something like the lhc is a generational project .
one of the very interesting facts is that , in addition , we find that even once we hold constant , statistically , the effect of your own education , the education of everyone else in your metropolitan area also affects your wages .
you can lead a good , ethical life , but some bad phraseology in a tweet can overwhelm it all , become a clue to your secret inner evil .
you may recognize a couple of the miners there .
now , take into account the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe , ok , a three-dimensional space .
now , i &apos;m not predicting 200 years of chaos as a result of this . 50 .
and west antarctica cropped up on top some under-sea islands , is particularly rapid in its melting .
relative to the universe , it &apos;s just up the road .
but we have to recognize that we have those limitations .
is all of our brain going to start to shrink and atrophy like that ?
i &apos;ve actually eaten seven of those baskets and they &apos;re very good .
( applause ) and so the significance is that we have now developed this model that is helping us , not only finally with evaluation , assessing what works .
david hockney talks about how the appreciation of this very glamorous painting is heightened if you think about the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash , which only took a fraction of a second to happen .
my best man , i told him he could surprise me , and he thought this would be hilarious , but this is not something .
it &apos;s decades old , but it &apos;s becoming very trendy among police forces around the planet lately , it seems , and according to my experience as a non-voluntary breather of it , tear gas has two main but quite opposite effects .
and the town has really embraced it .
and the corollary , of course , is that any further changes that could significantly change the substrate of thinking could have potentially enormous consequences .
let &apos;s continue with that same excerpt .
gh : well , one of the glorious things that &apos;s starting to happen now is that the collapse of these systems and the consequences are becoming obvious .
so i had to launch a very expensive salvage operation and then wait another nine months before i could get back out onto the ocean again .
when the books were first published , i invited her to the book launch party , and in front of everyone there , everyone she had fed over the years , i gave her a piece of artwork and some books .
i just wanted you to know that .
but in niger , for example , less than seven percent of the children are breastfed for the first six months of life , exclusively .
( laughter ) two letters , an l and an o , now a worldwide force .
so just to let you see what is the code of life .
simple designs for infection control had not been thought about , and people had died because of it .
you know , what i do is write for children , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most widely read children &apos;s author , in fact .
in other words , if democracy is to be rebuilt , is to become again vigorous and vibrant , it is necessary not just for the public to learn to trust their politicians , but for the politicians to learn to trust the public .
and i &apos;m going to show you a sample of the piece , &quot; from conception to birth . &quot;
this suggests to me that life causing these mass extinctions because it did is inherently anti-gaian .
that &apos;s not their role ; they &apos;re supposed to read what we write .
they include exploration , which is about going for quantity ; building , and thinking with your hands ; and role-play , where acting it out helps us both to have more empathy for the situations in which we ’ re designing , and to create services and experiences that are seamless and authentic .
i don &apos;t want to take you through the gory details , i just want to tell you about some of the amazing features of this product .
people are learning more things about it .
you have to give to receive .
well , you know , i think the answer is very simple : working with nature , working with this tool set that we now understand , is the next step in humankind &apos;s evolution .
now , the advantage of studying our own galaxy is it &apos;s simply the closest example of the center of a galaxy that we &apos;re ever going to have , because the next closest galaxy is 100 times further away .
it means that violence , the rule of warriors and despotic chiefs , the conditions of camps and warfare , of riot and tyranny , give place to parliaments where laws are made , and independent courts of justice in which over long periods those laws are maintained .
this is in portland . that is an actual development .
it &apos;s beginning to grow tremendously .
it &apos;s the greenest building in the world .
she shows us , trains us how to do and how to be better &#91; people &#93; and how to do long hours in surgery — 300 patients per day , 10 , 20 surgeries , and still you have to manage the camp — that &apos;s how she trains us .
what is that number ? half a billion ? a billion ? what is that number ?
that &apos;s walking abraham &apos;s path .
but that ’ s not really true : you can be a serious professional adult and , at times , be playful .
that can actually hardly be seen from the canal tours .
you can do that quite fast .
this is a refrigerator factory , churning out airplanes for world war ii .
imagine : many of these problems could be prevented if these babies were just kept warm .
son : why ?
( applause )
( applause ) thank you . thank you . thank you .
wonderful job onstage .
farmers are facing challenges of drought from asia to africa , from australia to oklahoma , while heat waves linked with climate change have killed tens of thousands of people in western europe in 2003 , and again in russia in 2010 .
and in the ideal case , the hypothesis isn &apos;t just an idea : ideally , it is a law of nature .
this is how it looks like in practice . we have this grass we want to get rid of .
the crisis is almost certainly deepening around us .
i don &apos;t belong in this street .
hourly simulations show that largely or wholly renewable grids can deliver highly reliable power when they &apos;re forecasted , integrated and diversified by both type and location .
in fact , i &apos;d go so far as to say , if you don &apos;t already have a nerd in your life , you should get one .
and i &apos;m going to try and show that at the end , and the suspense will be as much mine if it works .
in short , can we carve out a future which is peaceful and mutually prosperous , or are we looking at a great challenge of war or peace ?
so i was told about 10 years ago that this would never happen , that this was close to impossible .
here is the critical difference between these : lolcats is communal value .
a much more powerful approach to public health — imagine what might be possible .
rb : dropping in for tea .
what if ?
let &apos;s fast-forward just 15 years from now .
( applause ) chris anderson : sendhil , thank you so much .
it &apos;s completely mechanical , again , a printer .
it &apos;s transparent with blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz of a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live their lives in public .
a health crisis makes people do all sorts of risky things , like quitting a job or jumping out of an airplane and , in the case of my sister , saying &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; to several therapy sessions , during which we got down to the marrow .
( applause ) thank you .
a lot of things are going through your head .
we didn &apos;t have the luxury of pre-recorded samples of speech for those born with speech disorder .
changes the way medicine works .
we do still use fortran .
it &apos;s just actually — you see , this is folding up — it &apos;s behind the seat .
you now have control over your own destiny .
speaking of gandhi , he was a recovering lawyer , as i &apos;ve heard the term , and he was called to a greater cause , something that mattered to him , he couldn &apos;t not do .
now , four years ago , chris lost his job , unfortunately , as an art buyer at macy &apos;s , and like so many people , he struggled to find a new one during the recession .
voice 1 : it &apos;s coming again . voice 2 : new wave ?
they develop science that makes it easier and easier to do .
so once again , we see that these two graphs are actually saying the same thing .
so crisis leading into opportunities .
but that is expensive .
we &apos;re going to do something that in recent years we &apos;ve started : take a mucus sample .
friendship , altruism , compassion , service – all the perennial truths that we talked about that are part of all religion and all cultures — once you stop trying to see the differences , these are the things in our own self-interest , because they free us from our suffering and from disease .
but look , i can prove to you that they &apos;re straight because i can take any one of these lines , and i can fold along it .
so , a couple spreads from the book : here mcluhan says , &quot; the new media are not bridges between man and nature ; they are nature . &quot;
( laughter ) but when we dug deeper , we didn &apos;t find corruption in the classic sense : slimy gangsters lurking in the darkness , waiting to grease the palms of their friends .
how could i share my sense of rome , my understanding of rome ?
well , when he was oil minister , he awarded an oil block now worth over a billion dollars to a company that , guess what , yeah , he was the hidden owner of .
but in my first 25 years of career , i had a bunch of different experiences .
because what the facts are telling us is that the long , slow journey , humanity &apos;s long , slow journey of equality , is actually speeding up .
and early in the morning , i went into the ward .
karstic regions cover almost 20 percent of the continents &apos; surface , and we know actually that speleologists in the last 50 years have explored roughly 30,000 kilometers of cave passages around the world , which is a big number .
wk : yeah . i test .
our democracies are weakened in the global economy with players that can evade laws , evade taxes , evade environmental or labor standards .
and we ’ re only just beginning to grasp it .
the original version of the story , the one that i tried last summer , that pairs the personal questions with four minutes of eye contact , was referenced in this article , but unfortunately it was never published .
in contrast , i took a plate with six one-dollar bills , and i left those plates in the same refrigerators .
so , as a last thought , i think that integrating information to everyday objects will not only help us to get rid of the digital divide , the gap between these two worlds , but will also help us , in some way , to stay human , to be more connected to our physical world .
i was born in switzerland and raised in ghana , west africa .
dromedary .
should &apos;ve been a dancer .
maybe sometime in the future , we will .
how about counting every calorie ?
and indeed , unfortunately , if you navigate by needs you get a very unfocused agenda , because in these situations , needs are everywhere , but the capacity to implement change is very limited .
at the time , what they thought distinguished science was a radical idea about things unseen , known as empiricism .
women used to get really debilitating surgeries to excise all of the axillary lymph nodes .
and this is how the tamper-proof drug industry was invented .
they &apos;re carrying instruments that are actually taking data down to 2,000 meters .
so now , i started from the big problem , and i couldn &apos;t answer it .
and there the simple version of the message is it &apos;s moving from west to east .
so you put human growth hormone in , the person grows taller , or you put x in and the person gets fatter or loses metabolism or does a whole series of things , but you &apos;re altering the functions in a fundamental way .
i &apos;ll go through a little of them . bolotnitsa .
now , the key here is to figure out what that schwarzschild radius is .
behind every window and door frame , you &apos;ll see a small child peering back at you , and while makoko seems to be packed with people , what &apos;s more shocking is actually the amount of children pouring out of every building .
so a little over three years ago , kirsty boyle and i started a project we called open materials .
that , in fact , you couldn &apos;t have a functioning democracy if citizens didn &apos;t get a good flow of information , that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter , and then journalistic ethics developed .
maybe you &apos;ve seen them in the airports ? they seem to be everywhere now .
so , the god vishnu arrived .
and influential voices came up with one answer .
and it definitely does give a different image of yemen .
these communities of cells , again , began to abstract information .
and listen to people . they have the solutions in front of you .
this is van quach .
it &apos;s been a total home run .
he was sent very far away , and she was left behind .
but it wasn &apos;t simply for office or power or celebrity or fame — what it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in life so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it .
and it was a warning — don &apos;t get involved in other people &apos;s business , or you &apos;re going to get stuck .
our nsf-funded work found that it could be warm enough for open water from many types of atmospheres and orientations of its orbit .
then the professor listened to my story and he said , &quot; &quot; you have a job . you have hope .
and then , these are really crude pieces . we were just doing some tests here .
trade has increased .
so i &apos;m going to talk just a little bit about the origin of these politics , because it &apos;s really crucial to understanding why this summer is so important , why we need to stay focused .
if you reach out to the people on the ground in this collaborative way it &apos;s extremely affordable .
this is a clear don norman watch .
males are affected four to one compared to females with autism , and we really don &apos;t understand what that cause is .
we don &apos;t want to get old , and rightly so .
this is something that we can do .
i want to speak about a forgotten conflict .
the converse is also true .
four million of these babies die annually .
forty years ago , bob kahn and i did the design of the internet .
what i discovered was this is not true .
i thank you .
i &apos;m not quite sure i &apos;ve succeeded .
in the upper right of that picture on the left is almost the mississippi delta , and the lower left of that picture is the texas-mexico border .
and i &apos;m not talking about losing diversity in the same way that you lose your car keys .
these are actually used to burrow into the bone and collect bone marrow or sample bone lesions .
it &apos;s a personal injury . it &apos;s a kind of rape .
okay , here we go .
but this is just one , two , three billion people , and obviously there are seven billion people in the world , so there must be one , two , three , four billion people more who live in between the poverty and the air line .
i want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking .
endangered whales are killed every year by ship collision , and it &apos;s very important to try to reduce this .
that &apos;s because the size of the brain usually follows the size of the body .
fortunately for me , my parents were not poetic .
you don &apos;t think ; it goes automatically , if you merge yourself with the music , and so forth .
we silence them . we make them feel guilty for being smart . we get them to behave , to tone it down , not to be too intense .
this is far too simplistic .
they can start to look at common pathways — other things that they simply haven &apos;t been able to do before .
well , they said , &quot; &quot; people won &apos;t understand , they &apos;ll think it &apos;s a discotheque . you can &apos;t do that . &quot; &quot; and they shelved the project . and it sat there for 10 years , and then one day abe spiegel from los angeles , who had lost his three-year-old son at auschwitz , came , saw the model , wrote the check and it got built 10 years later .
what really counts is when we actually use our numbers to truly take into account our people .
but rather all of these different practices — you know , the ancient swamis and rabbis and priests and monks and nuns didn ’ t develop these techniques to just manage stress or lower your blood pressure , unclog your arteries , even though it can do all those things .
i have to tangibilitate the gospel . &quot; &quot; so , the real issue is : how do you tangibilitate compassion ?
i mean here was a girl who had never lived in peace time who somehow had come to sound like a candidate from &quot; &quot; the apprentice . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so i asked her , &quot; &quot; how in the world do you know this much about business ?
well , let me suggest to you that seti obviously can &apos;t solve the problem , but it can address the problem .
i get sick . you get sick .
so it &apos;s difficult to attack malaria from inside malarious societies , but it &apos;s equally tricky when we try to attack it from outside of those societies .
but if a young learner can &apos;t understand anything in science and learns to hate it because it all sounds like this , that will ruin their chances of success .
bathed in polarized light and cut in cross-section , this ancient ice reveals itself as a mosaic of colors , each one showing how conditions at depth in the ice have affected this material at depths where pressures can reach a ton per square inch .
( video ) and particularly i want to thank two outstanding mit — pranav mistry : so , i was seeing the live &#91; video &#93; of his talk , outside , on just a newspaper .
currently , taxpayers spend about 60,000 dollars per year sending a person to jail .
this is from some guy named ted .
this poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky — a very similar description to what albert einstein gave as to how he imagined the forces of relativity , when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked .
please raise your hand right now if you &apos;re willing to admit that all four of these are national problems .
that confirms its existence and its importance .
it is a censorship-free world visited by anonymous users .
so , let me ask you this — i can cultivate this intuition by asking a question — who would you rather be if a deadly germ was spreading through the network , a or b ?
the reason i think that is that on the first day i tried one of these services , i got two voicemail messages . one was from a guy named michael stevenson , which shouldn &apos;t be that hard to transcribe , and it was misspelled .
they control 3.4 million cubic miles of ocean , and that &apos;s between one and two percent of all the ocean water on the planet .
hence older people are much better than younger people at supervising , administering , advising , strategizing , teaching , synthesizing , and devising long-term plans .
people had been known to have died in the crush on popular execution days .
and how you end up with a psychopath , and a killer , depends on exactly when the damage occurs .
the worth should be about $ 2.5 million . &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; solomon , if we &apos;re going to do it , let &apos;s go big .
i &apos;d like to end with a few verses of what i wrote at my father &apos;s cremation .
so tackling a tiny challenge without giving up , even one as absurd as snapping your fingers exactly 50 times or counting backwards from 100 by seven is actually a scientifically validated way to boost your willpower .
that way you can see that at no time can anything travel , as long as i &apos;m squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleeve .
by the way , when i showed this slide to a group of kiwanians in my town , they all rose in indignation from their creamed chicken , ( laughter ) and they shouted at me and said , &quot; it was raining that day when you took that picture ! &quot;
it &apos;s not balanced by any means , not even close .
and it &apos;s important , if you try to model this , you can think about normal development as a loss of cortical mass , loss of cortical gray matter , and what &apos;s happening in schizophrenia is that you overshoot that mark , and at some point , when you overshoot , you cross a threshold , and it &apos;s that threshold where we say , this is a person who has this disease , because they have the behavioral symptoms of hallucinations and delusions .
we still don &apos;t know yet how important it is ; this is still an open question .
the fellow in the door , andre filitrault — who &apos;s the director of the center for interdisciplinary earthquake engineering research at the university of buffalo — was examining it to see if it was safe to recover the archives .
to borrow from the writings of a spider named charlotte , silk is terrific .
and he was saying that with kepler &apos;s extreme precision , it could actually detect alien megastructures around stars , but it didn &apos;t .
when you do it wrong , it &apos;s anesthetizing .
how did this happen ?
isn &apos;t that a wonderful thought , that there could be such a thing as a best idea anybody ever had ?
science , science has allowed us to know so much about the far reaches of the universe , which is at the same time tremendously important and extremely remote , and yet much , much closer , much more directly related to us , there are many things we don &apos;t really understand .
aa : when they got bored with their father &apos;s project , they invented an extraordinary little plane of their own .
the decision to arraign christopher and give him a criminal record was exclusively mine .
and so this is why climate scientists say it &apos;s not just that we know that climate change is happening , we know that greenhouse gases are a major part of the reason why .
the founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that i would be standing here today , 75 years later , telling you that the study still continues .
and she does it a few thousand times every day .
( applause )
now , inside , we felt like — i guess at the end of the day we felt like we were good people doing good work , but on the outside that wasn &apos;t evident .
i &apos;m sure many of you remember a distant time when we had to know phone numbers , when we knew our friends &apos; phone numbers .
one of them , from anthropology , is the study of human universals .
i went to spain a few months ago and i had the best foie gras of my life .
ataturk , rather like nicolas sarkozy , was very keen to discourage the wearing of a veil , in turkey , to modernize it .
and we &apos;re down to less than 70 nesting pairs in florida bay today , because we &apos;ve disrupted the system so much .
now imagine an object , amazing object , or something which we cannot explain when we just stand up and say , &quot; look , we give up . physics doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
but i was totally unprepared for how much there was and how spectacular it was .
can we stand to have more relationships ?
better put that up .
sustainability has gone from a nice-to-do to a must-do .
he got a stroke , and he was really , really sick , so he really couldn &apos;t tell me what to do next .
is it going to add local services like shops to the neighborhood that local people would like to use ?
( laughter ) well , yeah , a lot of them .
and emeka and i have had these discussions .
the lessons for us are three-fold .
people just use their cell phones to tweet .
the text here is right side and upside down so that you are forced to turn the book around , and you can see it from ground point of view and from her point of view — looking in the hole , getting a different kind of perspective , moving you around the space . particularly appropriate in a building that can contain perfectly a sphere dimensions of the diameter being the same as the distance from the center of the floor to the center of the oculus .
it was a little bit too funky , and we wanted a more feminine point of view and employed a duck who did it in a much more fitting way — fashion .
&quot; &quot; iloveyou &quot; &quot; appears many times in many different languages .
and it has a very nice acute property .
and so i put them all together and sewed 12 of them in this suit .
which brings us to soap opera lesson two : sacrifice your ego and drop the superiority complex .
you prove one , you prove the other .
and because we are a proud profession , it is very hard for us to look in the mirror and see our mistakes .
and that weekend , i was going back home and herbie hancock was playing our center that night — first time i &apos;d met him .
this could be one of the shared , modular , driverless vehicles of tomorrow .
now , the most amazing part of this whole process has been sharing ideas and wishes , and so i invite you to give brainstorms onto how does this day echo into the future ?
we &apos;re just waiting for someone to lead us . &quot; &quot; michelle kaufman has pioneered new ways of thinking about environmental architecture .
so realizing the truth gave me a position to choose : should i continue to hate , or let it go ?
so what should you do ? am i telling you to not strive ?
abolishing fossil fuels means disrupting our transportation system so that we can power our cars , buses and trains with electricity instead of dirty energy .
it &apos;s the kind of gut center , where you see an image and you go , &quot; &quot; oh ! i have a strong or emotional reaction to whatever i &apos;m seeing . &quot; &quot; so the combination of these processing centers help us make meaning in very different ways .
well , unfortunately , i &apos;ve got so many viagra ads coming at me , your email is lost .
and in fact , i think the only thing that the sdr would likely steal from the dollar under this scheme is its nickname , the &quot; &quot; greenback . &quot; &quot; because even with that cap in place , the imf could have followed up its issuance — its massive issuance of sdrs in 2009 — with a further 200 billion dollars of sdrs in 2014 .
i &apos;ve tracked gun smugglers from russia to somalia , i &apos;ve worked with warlords in afghanistan and the congo , i &apos;ve counted cadavers in colombia , in haiti , in sri lanka , in papua new guinea .
rsw : at a certain point a number of years ago , people — when michael graves was a fashion , before teapots ...
there isn &apos;t any construction going on . and so the sector shrivels away .
i purchased a 100-pound load cell , thinking , no animal could produce more than 100 pounds at this size of an animal .
you can &apos;t see how different your search results are from anyone else &apos;s .
i was working to transform these internalized responses , to transform the preconceptions that had so shaped my identity when i started using a wheelchair , by creating unexpected images .
now i &apos;m going to show you a three-year-old who got the same puzzle .
so now i &apos;m going to show you a picture .
who i was on my business card mattered to me .
it &apos;s very similar to what you do when you design your product .
the design of a street can tell you everything about what &apos;s expected on it .
that is not enough .
we do it to make them love us , to seduce them .
it will make tons of people watch , because people want this experience .
everybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube ? ok .
( laughter ) but why not this ? ( laughter )
and i &apos;m working very hard with my colleague , arnold van huis , in telling people what insects are , what magnificent things they are , what magnificent jobs they do in nature .
but some rooms have tall windows to keep the air conditioning in and the bugs out .
i call it moneyballing criminal justice .
and one fine day , she decided to take them into the garden to teach them some nature vocabulary .
to run the reaction , you put the plate inside a device like this one , and then you can put your smartphone on top of it .
it &apos;s like a mechanical trick .
and everybody outside thought we were dying .
and when they began on this corner and wrapped around the entire hospital , they were so good at putting these stones together , they asked us if they could take down the original wall and rebuild it .
( laughter ) but as you &apos;re thinking about this , one of the interesting things is how small these mutations are and where they take place .
car-sharing was actually invented in europe .
so the question should come to your mind is , what kind of design , you know , what kind of creative process and what kind of design produced the world like that ?
more than 400,000 people die in the united states every year from smoking cigarettes .
this is incredibly simple , it &apos;s like your opal card .
they use techniques that he &apos;s never heard of , and for his half a million dollars in prize money , rob mcewen finds 3.4 billion dollars worth of gold .
one is the gap in opportunity — this gap that president clinton last night called uneven , unfair and unsustainable — and , out of that , comes poverty and illiteracy and disease and all these evils that we see around us .
i want to challenge you today that to be the first , because people will follow you .
two years ago , three years ago , about four years ago , markets did well .
( music ) ( video ) man : i mean , i know we were hoping for good waves , but i don &apos;t think anybody thought that was going to happen .
break them , boil them down into much smaller problems , and then find simple solutions for them .
we have a huge problem facing us as a species .
after all , you pointed out that reason is just a means to an end , and the end depends on the reasoner &apos;s passions .
we built our first prototype drones in switzerland .
eythor bender : we are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device , this new exoskeleton this year .
if we go down the small pathway a little bit farther , we &apos;re entering the era of nanomedicine , the ability to make devices super small to the point where we can design red blood cells or microrobots that will monitor our blood system or immune system , or even those that might clear out the clots from our arteries .
so this is a pattern that assumes we &apos;re all in this together .
it &apos;s that simple .
and that sucks , right ? so 45 percent of men develop cancer . thirty-eight percent of women develop cancer .
the open world is bringing empowerment and freedom .
the first is : take core positions with your client .
we go into rural communities and all we do , like has been done in this room , is create the space .
and if you wanted the machine to play a different song , you just swapped a new cylinder in with a different code on it .
while she maintained the strict views imposed on her by her mother that separate could not be equal .
and if i can hold two things in that environment , i can hold so many more things .
i just came out of the weight shack from working out , and i saw an older gentleman that i knew standing in the middle of the yard just looking up at the sky .
this particular idea , however — although we don &apos;t yet know whether it &apos;s right or wrong , and at the end i &apos;ll discuss experiments which , in the next few years , may tell us whether it &apos;s right or wrong — this idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century and continues to inform a lot of cutting-edge research .
i always get goosebumps every time i see it .
it &apos;s not in the abstract ; it &apos;s the interaction with the environment .
the fact that they &apos;re not right in front of us , the fact , of course , that they &apos;re of a different nationality or race , none of that seems morally relevant to me .
and they experience them how they did in the body .
literally , 10 percent of the neighborhood died in seven days , and much more would have died if people hadn &apos;t fled after the initial outbreak kicked in .
bj : about 40 people .
ll : right . bingo . point .
but in the end , business grew bigger than ever .
if we can get over this discomfort with this entire topic , we could create something that creates our future goldmine .
europe is one of the first places that we start to see graphic marks regularly appearing in caves , rock shelters and even a few surviving open-air sites .
i don &apos;t want to make this as a corporate entity .
over the course of the internship , i began to recognize people in the auditorium , not because they were criminal masterminds but because they were coming to us for help and we were sending them out without any .
we see that companies acting ethically in this world are outperforming those that don &apos;t .
those are the conversations that really matter .
ca : so , now , you &apos;ve always had this exploration bug in you .
i didn &apos;t try to figure out what one does with that .
this is what the u.k. government target on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like .
and i bore no hostility against this , my country , nor enmity towards the non-muslim citizens , and i still don &apos;t .
so when i heard that the translator , gregory rabassa , had written his own book on the subject , i couldn &apos;t wait to read it .
there are all sorts of types of music that are very healthy .
( applause )
it &apos;s also known as the spawning ground for eels from northern european and northern american rivers that are now so dwindling in numbers that they &apos;ve actually stopped showing up in stockholm , and five showed up in the u.k. just recently .
is this not making order out of chaos ?
and we think this is species-specific , which means that that could explain why we can &apos;t communicate across species .
just trying to play the odds . all right , here we go .
now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blockages in two coronary arteries and your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist who &apos;s batting 200 on angioplasties .
and for me , atheism 2.0 is about both , as i say , a respectful and an impious way of going through religions and saying , &quot; &quot; what here could we use ? &quot; &quot; the secular world is full of holes .
soon he was homeless and 60,000 dollars in medical debt , including a fee for dialing for an ambulance .
raise your hands . let me see .
we found this last year .
they have actually retained access to the profitable drug trade , but the way they do it is , because they control all of michoacán , and they control the port of lázaro cárdenas , they leverage that to , for example , trade copper from michoacán that is legally created and legally extracted with illegal ephedrine from china which is a critical precursor for methamphetamines that they produce , and then they have partnerships with larger organizations like the sinaloa federation that place their products in the u.s.
now watch , he has to downshift .
when we started this project , one of the core ideas was to look back in history and try to understand what was there .
but it &apos;s easy to see why these animals make such great cartoon characters , their shapes and sizes .
imagine the teenage farm girl who makes less than a dollar an hour stitching your running shoes , or the young chinese man who jumps off a rooftop after working overtime assembling your ipad .
it can grow ; you can grow it ; and — did i mention ? — it &apos;s quite tasty .
and then you have to store them at about minus 20 degrees c — that &apos;s about minus four fahrenheit , i think — with a very critically low moisture content .
these are the questions that should not remain just inside the lab , and so one goal of today &apos;s talk was to bring everybody up to speed with the kind of stuff that &apos;s possible in modern neuroscience , but now , just as importantly , to actively engage everybody in this conversation .
( laughter ) the department of homeland security is a strategic feel good measure .
since then , it &apos;s happened again in london , it &apos;s happening internationally , and across the country .
people move to cities to be connected , and connectivity is why these cities thrive .
i told him , &quot; &quot; well , i want to go to where you are , &quot; &quot; because this man looked very happy , and i admired that .
this is a feasible goal , basically because , contrary to widespread assumption , i would argue that we know how to do this .
i held on when i arrived at yale at 18 , with the faith that my journey from oak cliff , texas was a chance to leave behind all the challenges i had known , the broken dreams and broken bodies i had seen .
that &apos;s headed up to about nine billion .
to fight boredom and amuse himself while in the cmu , mcgowan had been spreading a rumor that i was secretly the president of a twilight fan club in washington , dc ( laughter ) for the record , i &apos;m not . ( laughter )
this plant is called the welwitschia , and it lives only in parts of coastal namibia and angola , where it &apos;s uniquely adapted to collect moisture from mist coming off the sea .
guess what ?
so , we have to ask ourselves the question : why leave women &apos;s health to chance ?
we &apos;re doing some work for him .
that is the very definition of being stuck in a comfort zone .
two answers ? there may possibly be a third alternative .
so there are two good reasons to think that this kind of technique can be applied to democracies in general and in particular to the law .
we have demonstrated that our model works .
but you go to rwanda — a very small country — 8,000 mothers with hiv who are pregnant .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about .
any of one of these journalists , they could have broken the pact .
how far can we take it ?
but at the same time , we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work .
there are great discoveries yet to be made down there , fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution and possibly bioactive compounds that could benefit us in ways that we can &apos;t even yet imagine .
sometimes the object will slide across the table , sometimes it will not .
and it got to the point where every time i walked up to a table that had a kid anywhere between three and 10 years old , i was ready to fight .
this is actually a period of dramatic change in which it doesn &apos;t take learning , per se , to drive the initial differentiation of the machinery of the brain .
and so the bands at tootsie &apos;s or at cbgb &apos;s had to play loud enough — the volume had to be loud enough to overcome people falling down , shouting out and doing whatever else they were doing .
this is an undergraduate volunteer — we have 30,000 undergraduates so we can choose among them — that &apos;s actually just a red pen mark .
by saying that we &apos;re going to fight for women &apos;s rights and fight extremism with bombs and warfare , we completely cripple local societies which need to address these issues so that they &apos;re sustainable .
you travel , you see all these horrible things happening . &quot; &quot; firstly , the human brain — i don &apos;t need to say anything about that .
now , you take pre-kindergarten .
but less than 24 hours , i was 13 miles away from those mosques , visiting one of our acumen investees , an incredible man , jawad aslam , who dares to live a life of immersion .
the main american manufacturer of that active ingredient decided a few years ago to relocate to china because it &apos;s the world &apos;s biggest supplier of pigs .
( applause )
barclays bank of the u.k. is bringing in 500 million .
they almost brought the entire financial system down .
well , then the error is 6 .
nasa has devoted money to this .
the boundary of my brain that divides real from fantasy has finally begun to crumble .
karl marx , on the other hand , said that the alienation of labor is incredibly important in how people think about the connection to what they are doing .
rughal : there must be something we can do .
there are also a number of features that vary between continents like that that have to do with how we metabolize food that we ingest , or that have to do with how our immune systems deal with microbes that try to invade our bodies .
so we turn to the field of vaccines .
we &apos;re living in one of the most exciting times in history .
so this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one wikipedia page .
we have the kind of the flash of insight , the stroke of insight , we have epiphanies , we have &quot; &quot; eureka ! &quot; &quot; moments , we have the lightbulb moments , right ?
well psychology actually says there is a tension — a tension between self-regarding behaviors and other regarding behaviors .
this is a simulation of chesapeake bay .
here is my naive advertising man &apos;s suggestion .
so we started playing around with this .
and analysis shows if you want to be among the most favorite ted speakers , you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average , make sure you wear your glasses and be slightly more dressed-up than the average ted speaker .
and i &apos;m able to learn a lot from it .
we do a lot of good things in the intelligence community , things that need to be done , and things that help everyone .
( applause )
and everybody was quiet .
you manage , the village manages these warehouses .
jr : it didn &apos;t go down that well with some people .
they tended to have highly pro-environmental attitudes regardless .
he made false papers for persecuted black south africans .
we have the means already in our hands , through a structure , through a mechanism , called redd plus — a scheme for the reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation .
is it a hearing problem or is it a physicality problem ?
that &apos;s why 10 years later , it continues to shock me , knowing that 96 percent of genome studies associating common genetic variation with specific diseases have focused exclusively on individuals of european ancestry .
we also need to go back to the ideas that butenandt used when he was studying the silk moth .
and become the largest economy in the world .
and finally , the layer that i love , of knowledge .
growing leather is also technically simpler than growing other animal products like meat .
you can &apos;t do that while you &apos;re texting , and so ways are developing of doing it within this medium .
( laughter ) on the roof of the swiss embassy , we installed a series of antennas .
okay , well , i &apos;m just gonna answer this really fast , as , like , three or four different people .
i used a little tweezer which i made from a hair clip .
we do not need to spill the water if we don &apos;t want to .
but saying her name is not enough .
so , many times when you try to do research on data , it records complicated stories — it &apos;s hard to find in the data .
at one point , javier said to octavio , &quot; &quot; what if we took some of our empty land — what if we just gave it to an embassy — give some to the u.s. embassy ; give some to the canadian embassy — and then if people want to go work under the rules of canada or under the rules of the united states , they can go get jobs , do everything they do on those embassy grounds that they would otherwise have to go to canada or the u.s. to do ? &quot; &quot; in the summer of 2009 , honduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis .
every new media technology raises privacy concerns .
and i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll feel that it &apos;s from a safe source .
then there &apos;s the return .
it &apos;s all bound by oxygen and silicates .
in the united states , possibly 80 percent of the antibiotics sold every year go to farm animals , not to humans , creating resistant bacteria that move off the farm in water , in dust , in the meat the animals become .
a simple wooden notice board .
and so the question is : how did that material get here ?
and when i strap just this little harness , this little wing , i really have the feeling of being a bird .
but to me , the most significant thing that i saw in 1995 was this .
at home , it &apos;s dangerously easy to assume we &apos;re on top of things .
so what i &apos;ve done is created a highly scientific taxonomy of haters .
the payoff is enormous , both in terms of health and in terms of economic growth . we need to support that .
but most of them are going to carry on . and next stop , perhaps only four or five days away is going to be east africa .
this awareness has the power to transform medical care for men and women .
it &apos;s very hard to for them to get through there , and of course , if you can &apos;t get through there , you can &apos;t get to the later stages .
( laughter ) ( applause ) you will not like it .
i come to also look at this as this fear that we have as men , this fear that just has us paralyzed , holding us hostage to this man box .
so , this would be the twitter search screen .
if i had a little extra money , i &apos;d buy a hostess fruit pie .
so at minus 271 degrees , colder than the space between the stars , those wires can take that current .
the vertical axis now is thousands of dollars in today &apos;s prices .
in education , medicine , law , diplomacy , government , business and the media that exist today .
and a hydrostatic skeleton uses two elements .
and in so many ways , i think this is a terrific liberation .
why did we set up these experiments ?
and it &apos;s a number of projects .
the law — the law is like that ambulance that shows up and is ready to treat emma only if it can be shown that she was harmed on the race road or on the gender road but not where those roads intersected .
that &apos;s my little son .
and instead of asking the question , &quot; &quot; how long until i see a head-tail-head ? &quot; &quot; — you can ask , &quot; &quot; how big will the chunks be when i use a restriction enzyme which cuts whenever it sees g-a-a-g , for example ?
their plumbing system turns off , so the sites have to move .
and these metals accumulate as minerals on the surface of the bacteria .
we believe that the markets is this magic pot that obeys only one command : make more money .
so what i &apos;m asking for is the creation of a new job title — i &apos;ll come to this a little later — and perhaps the addition of a new word into the english language .
it had a success rate of about one in eight tries .
form is function . form is function .
if economics , if the market , drives security , and if people make trade-offs based on the feeling of security , then the smart thing for companies to do for the economic incentives are to make people feel secure .
unfortunately , most of the people in the world are not so lucky .
their mates were chosen for them .
instead , we prefer these really dazzling technological solutions , which cost a huge amount of money .
then there should always be in sight the draw — a kind of a beacon that draws you on through the labyrinth to finish the process of getting there .
the soil , let me tell you , has missed us .
your movie has smell and taste and touch .
the president of kenya knew this , which is why in 2014 , he came to our lab and asked us to partner with him to be able to help kenya to jump-start business growth .
they brought the produce to local markets , and came home with the equivalent of money .
what we do know is that the corals are going to get hit hard .
and what he showed in mantis shrimp is that they use what &apos;s called a &quot; &quot; catch mechanism , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; click mechanism . &quot; &quot; and what this basically consists of is a large muscle that takes a good long time to contract , and a latch that prevents anything from moving .
it says here that this is the ocean plane of the future .
what was interesting about their ruling and about the discussion we &apos;ve just had is that the discussion about the right , the justice , of the matter depended on figuring out what is the essential nature of golf .
( video ) ms : how would you guys describe your brand ?
now , for the first time , you &apos;re going to see one of my colleague &apos;s children develop microbially .
how many chinese troops are serving under the blue beret , serving under the blue flag , serving under the u.n. command in the world today ?
and not only do these genetic males mate with other males , they actually have the capacity to lay eggs even though they &apos;re genetic males .
this was actually used by the mayans as an artificial tooth replacement .
there is even a photo studio where you see the sort of aspiration to live in a real house or to be associated with a faraway place , like that hotel in sweden .
going deeper into the legacy of the eastern european regimes , i worked for several months on a story about the effects of industrial pollution , where there had been no regard for the environment or the health of either workers or the general population .
( laughter ) ( applause ) pm : yes , you are .
they love namibia for its beautiful dunes , that are even taller than the empire state building .
when i ask him if it &apos;s safe to work in the field he said , &quot; i &apos;m not sure . &quot;
and in europe , there &apos;s certain parts of europe , where we &apos;re seeing a four-fold increase in certain genital birth defects .
fortunately , he came to the right place .
and i can &apos;t have my posse laughin &apos; at me .
you don &apos;t think about how nicole kidman is maneuvering that dress — she just looks completely natural .
they &apos;ve got that wryly smile on their mouth .
those are the critical questions , and what we have learned from pisa is that , in high-performing education systems , the leaders have convinced their citizens to make choices that value education , their future , more than consumption today .
so in 2007 , our team won half a million dollars by placing third place in this competition .
but this depends on choosing a voluntary simplicity , growing qualitatively , not quantitatively .
but because people who died this year of aids got it a few years ago , we can use this data on mortality to figure out what hiv prevalence was in the past .
things die when there &apos;s no food .
&quot; and how did the world change after 9 / 11 ? &quot;
secondly , the idea of building community among the students .
it lets nature decide , and nature , by and large , is pretty good at deciding .
and social business needs markets , and there are some issues for which you just can &apos;t develop the kind of money measures that you need for a market .
out flew plagues , sorrows , and all sorts of evils against man .
day three , doaa had a premonition .
so , in hearing this piece , as i mentioned before , the most important thing is the music &apos;s great , and it &apos;ll show you who dan is .
it &apos;s not hardware .
you stay away from design for development .
and i spent countless hours in presidential libraries trying to understand how the environment had shaped the leaders , the moves that they made , and then the impact of those moves beyond their tenure .
and when a transaction is conducted , it &apos;s posted globally , across millions and millions of computers .
they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; oh , ms. diversity lady , we &apos;re so glad you &apos;re here &quot; &quot; — ( laughter ) — &quot; but we don &apos;t have a biased bone in our body . &quot;
this is a 3d printer .
it you slow down , you reduce the amount of noise you make and you reduce the risk of collision .
it can do a tremendous amount of things .
abed would say , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; i then began to wonder , as i had many times before , how my life would have been different had this man not injured me , had my genes been fed a different helping of experience .
it &apos;s a closely held secret for reasons i don &apos;t know .
and finally , to make these things really functional , we want a lot of them working together in order to do bigger things .
finally , you can see i did have a choice to choose one of the three quotes with which i wanted to start my lecture .
could we bring down the lights please ? thank you .
now , that &apos;s also wrong , because traffic happens to be a nonlinear phenomenon , meaning that once you reach above a certain capacity threshold then congestion starts to increase really , really rapidly .
my cuban mother , which i just briefly introduced you to in that short character sketch , came to the united states one thousand years ago .
but watch what happens when we make some of them disappear . right .
it &apos;s a heartbreaking , excruciating conversation .
those decisions are made by the ministry of health or by foreign donors , and it just kind of shows up .
that was the power of that word that he was able to do .
i mean , obviously the orchestra musicians playing beautifully , the vienna philharmonic orchestra .
and so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side or stack them up .
i came to the heart institute in 2006 , as part of my elective in my anesthesia and intensive care program .
so this is how much people agree with the conclusions with no image .
or had raided their frat parties in the middle of the night ?
bg : who should be providing this support ?
then the old lady came towards me with a rusty-looking knife , one of the sharp knives , orange-looking , has never seen water or sunlight before .
but we simply cannot reach new heights and create an even higher garbage dump , one that &apos;s out of this world .
so moving to our second commandment that i wanted to show you .
so you — it was fun to get away from high school — ( laughter ) — because i was very small , and i was no good in sports , or anything like that .
they didn &apos;t have data and statistics .
who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution ? universities ? forget about it !
of course , if anybody asked me then , &quot; where is your home ? &quot;
i didn &apos;t quite get it . and paul rand was a kind of crusty designer , you know , a crusty designer , like a good — kind of like a good french bread ?
and alhurra is a u.s. government- sponsored arabic language television network that distributes news and information to over 22 countries in the arab world .
but this isn &apos;t just some problem that we need to contain .
and so after admitting i couldn &apos;t see to hr , they sent me off to an eye specialist .
and so i would say that &apos;s really the best way to make decisions , is go after what it is that creates meaning in your life and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows .
she got mad ; i took a licking .
these are members of my graduating class , 1986 .
we &apos;ve taken those circular fish-eye lens cameras , and we &apos;ve done some optical correction , and then we can bring it into three-dimensional life .
it was able — but only it was able — to organize health care , education , policing , justice .
if you noticed , in mountain home , there are trailer parks and trailers all over the place .
and the more you can recline , in a way , the better it is .
well a couple of things : understanding of the security , of the risks , the threats , the countermeasures , how they work .
by the &apos; 70s , home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets — and we all have our favorites , actually — made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home .
( applause )
and what we found was that indeed there was a correlation .
every time he paints these disturbing images , he sees them less or not at all .
but i think we &apos;re a lot closer to erring on the side of not comprehending the situation clearly enough , than in comprehending it so clearly that we just can &apos;t , you know , get the army out to kill terrorists .
and i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re here and that i &apos;m meeting you here at ted .
dogs get so abused .
he &apos;s now going to use the other thing which is essential , and that &apos;s his voice .
but can you imagine how many might have if the police had stopped those kids and searched their pockets for drugs as they walked to class ?
so , my kind of hero for this in the natural world are these tropical frogs .
the question of transformation in africa really is a question of leadership .
most of them did not go .
it wasn &apos;t a &quot; &quot; hindu rate of growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracies can &apos;t grow . &quot; &quot; actually india could .
and it &apos;s at this new frontier that we are forced with a new appraisal .
the other interesting thing for us — we like sensors — is this idea that you could have an on-ramp for the internet of things .
let &apos;s look at today .
so it could happen .
this seems to me both a deeply moving and a convincing re-statement of christian belief about god .
rng : that sort of co-option is all in the job description of reason .
it &apos;s called smart failure . why ? because you can &apos;t put it on your c.v.
so if we were to zoom into this guy &apos;s head , one of the things that you would see there is that there are no lymphatic vessels in the brain .
the united states , at this point , was putting pressure on all its arab allies , including tunisia , to stamp out extremism in their societies , and this imam found himself suddenly in the crosshairs of the tunisian intelligence service .
( applause )
the reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure is not because giant squid eat jellyfish , but it &apos;s because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light when it &apos;s being chewed on by a predator and its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of a larger predator that will attack its attacker and thereby afford it an opportunity for escape .
a few months ago , i got a phone call from a nursing home where i work .
it is man-made and can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings . &quot; &quot; i want to end by saying it &apos;s been the actions of thousands of ordinary human beings doing — i think — extraordinary work , that have actually improved health , and , maybe only in a small way , reduced poverty .
and this , of course , is the basis of much of eastern philosophy , and that is there is no real independent self , aloof from other human beings , inspecting the world , inspecting other people .
and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong , powerful and athletic person well into the future .
but i can assure you that this woman in the favela in rio , she wants a washing machine .
they just want their own pain to end .
( laughter ) and i wanted it not just for myself but i wanted it for my students as well .
she was telling me how her treatment was leveraging specific properties of our vascular system .
something that exists as a series of interactions over time ?
it &apos;s a liberation from our misconceptions , and it &apos;s an incentive to not expect so much from ourselves and to simply begin .
you &apos;re probably aware that there have been a spate of those directed against the u.s. financial sector since 2012 .
but what if it was coordinated with the dozens of other acts of nonviolent resistance that have taken place against isis ?
this is kind of like something i used to do in third grade .
so that at the end of the treatment , you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment .
fact is , we &apos;re living in the most peaceful moment in human history .
now , if i &apos;ll take you through — this is an early concept sketch — take you through kind of a mixture of all these things together .
this is the city hall over here somewhere , and the courthouse .
here is where we want you to channel this money . &quot; &quot; each one should not be an entrepreneur going out and finding what is best .
number two : a declining population means scarce labor .
what we didn &apos;t realize is just how many people were ready and waiting to put the bias aside .
( laughter ) it was a man called brian , who runs a crack team of scientologists who are determined to destroy psychiatry wherever it lies .
now , it looks like you &apos;re doing yourself out of a job , but you &apos;re not . you &apos;re actually making yourself more useful .
the retina chip extracts four different kinds of information .
and on the right-hand side , we show the same data , but here with daily incidence .
mounted on roads or on police cars , automatic license plate readers capture images of every passing car and convert the license plate into machine-readable text so that they can be checked against hot lists of cars potentially wanted for wrongdoing .
but then there &apos;s a lot of problems that come with meat production , and we &apos;re being faced with that more and more often .
and if you look at things like the iphone app , the fraction is considerably larger .
we raised 200 million dollars in a specialty fund to work on a pandemic in biodefense .
nothing about that would have been problematic to the child at all .
child survival is the new green .
because primarily of the power of the internet , people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money that can change the world for some public good if they all agree .
that all depends on our motivation .
that means that ballplayer batted safely , hit safely three times out of 10 at bats .
there was the washing of hands .
ordinary homeowners and renters have saved more than 250 million dollars on their energy bills , and we &apos;re just getting started .
thank you .
but all this excitement led to the press writing about us .
it &apos;s neither magmatic or volcanic in origin , and again , over 700 kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center .
i had become a mother and he was celebrating his 77th birthday , and suddenly i was very , very afraid .
and for motivation , we used what i think is the most powerful pharmacology of switzerland : fine swiss chocolate .
you can go to orcatech.org — it has nothing to do with whales , it &apos;s the oregon center for aging and technology — to see more about that .
when diane hatz worked on &quot; &quot; the meatrix , &quot; &quot; her video that spread all across the internet about the way farm animals are treated , she didn &apos;t invent the idea of being a vegan .
but of course , as an end user , you don &apos;t see that , because you only see the name of the company , not where it was developed .
we could go back to babbage &apos;s machine and just make it tiny . all those things are computers .
the procedures that make this work have been perfected , as i said , by paul farmer and his team in their work in rural haiti over the last 20 years .
the other thing : i wanted to give indigenous people a voice .
it &apos;s not just a root supplying a plant , but for each of those plants , whatever it is — a presentation , an analysis , somebody &apos;s looking for patterns in the data — they get to look at all the data and they get it connected together , and the really important thing about data is the more things you have to connect together , the more powerful it is .
and we got a great group of people to join us — principled people with great skills , and investors with a vision and values to match ours .
it &apos;s a touch device that we have developed based on these algorithms , using standard graphics gpus .
but it &apos;s worth recalling wittgenstein &apos;s remark on the subject : &quot; &quot; tell me , &quot; &quot; he asked a friend , &quot; &quot; why do people always say it was natural for man to assume that the sun went &apos; round the earth , rather than that the earth was rotating ? &quot; &quot; and his friend replied , &quot; &quot; well , obviously , because it just looks as though the sun is going round the earth . &quot; &quot; wittgenstein replied , &quot; &quot; well , what would it have looked like if it had looked as though the earth was rotating ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) science has taught us , against all intuition , that apparently solid things , like crystals and rocks , are really almost entirely composed of empty space .
this shows you the positions of some of these dams .
and we had not — i mean , we weren &apos;t frightened by it .
and you can scroll around and see some of the different airports and the different patterns that they have .
and i was having fun with it .
when you see the headlines of your newspaper these days with the war in iraq or in syria — aid worker abducted , hostage executed — but who were they ?
conservation group gets together , tries to figure out how to breed an animal that &apos;s almost extinct .
it seemed that nothing could stop this relentless industrial machine .
and we need to diversify our farms .
there &apos;s another hub in london , now , and the rest are getting set up . we hope to give the data away at some stage . that &apos;s a complicated issue about making it available to the rest of the world .
and it has to be solvable in a magazine .
there &apos;s germany at 13th , the u.s. comes 21st , mexico comes 66th , and then we have some of the big developing countries , like russia at 95th , china at 107th .
and so i started getting amazing amounts of hate mail , death threats even .
and that includes nature , and nurture , and what i refer to as nightmares .
one thing that brings us close to home is we look at dick cheney &apos;s device , he had a device that pumped blood from an aorta to another part of the heart , and as you can see at the bottom there , it was controlled by a computer controller , and if you ever thought that software liability was very important , get one of these inside of you .
plastic is the defining feature of cheap electrical goods .
for this particular problem , we designed a new category of worker who , like a sars worker or someone looking for bird flu , might find first cases .
is english a tsunami , washing away other languages ?
but then a couple of years later , when i was a company commander , i went out to the national training center .
you all got crisper drawers ?
they don &apos;t play 10 hours of action games in a row .
it is possible the answers we have are wrong , it is possible the questions themselves are wrong .
and i ran up the stairs , and there was one of my favorite books of all time , &quot; &quot; travels on my elephant &quot; &quot; by mark shand — i don &apos;t know if any of you know it .
so you &apos;re ( laughter ) you &apos;re really bored in the subway , and you kind of stare at something .
i can tap into thousands of people &apos;s minds . &quot; &quot; and the other nerdy side of me thought , &quot; &quot; this is horrible . this is completely bizarre .
so if you zoom in , what they &apos;re doing is holding these large molecules — nucleotides — together .
but nevertheless , neuroscience is turning up more and more in marketing .
so much for velcro , right ?
if , on the other hand , we need to look them all up , we may be in trouble .
i &apos;m going to show you some examples that i &apos;ve run into during my time at twitter — these are all real examples — of situations that at first seemed cut and dried , but the truth of the matter was something altogether different .
fifty percent of all the money that they earn or get gifted , 50 percent goes in their house account , 50 percent goes in their toy account .
and they &apos;re doing pretty well , but they &apos;ve got a bit of trouble .
we start with poverty .
sophos _ visitors , sansemea , companies i work with .
the reason for this is the way we make decisions .
but the problem is they &apos;re very fragmented .
so imagine that you &apos;re the participant in one of our experiments . you come into the lab , you see this computerized task .
we went down to the airfield early because this is the army and you always go early .
toxo infects mammals , a wide variety of mammals , but it can only sexually reproduce in a cat .
50 kilos for the entire fuselage .
so at the end , i had a settlement with them .
together , it &apos;s 0.3 .
both of them create great public experiences of shared ritual .
there was no fishing , there was no pollution , there was no coastal development , and the reef is on a full-bore recovery .
in 1975 , muhammad ali gave a lecture at harvard university .
and this has become such a norm of our professional lives , such a norm and such an expectation .
they are mulling whether they &apos;re going to take it further .
and like a lot of people , i thought government was basically about getting people elected to office .
we are more closely related to the chimp and the bonobo than the african elephant is to the indian elephant , as jared diamond pointed out in one of his early books .
and , of course , arctic communities are toast .
it &apos;s not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have .
many in my generation — because of well-intentioned parenting and self-esteem education — were socialized to believe that we were special little snowflakes — ( laughter ) who were going to go out and save the world .
it &apos;s very easy , win the million dollars .
if someone then tries to reuse it , it locks and breaks afterwards .
by the early 20th century , the perfect balance of science and art had finally been struck with the emergence of medical illustrators .
and trust is established , not by some big institution , but by collaboration , by cryptography and by some clever code .
debbie has worked all her life , pays taxes , supports herself month to month , proud of the american dream , a dream that just won &apos;t be complete without higher education .
in the last nine years , he &apos;s been arrested 13 times , and jailed for a total of 130 days on that panhandling case .
so you have caught flesh-eating disease if you caught that one .
but these are people that you will probably never believe .
now , i explained this growth of complexity by reference to something called &quot; &quot; non-zero sumness . &quot; &quot; assuming that a few of you did not do the assigned reading , very quickly , the key idea is the distinction between zero-sum games , in which correlations are inverse : always a winner and a loser .
that doesn &apos;t detract from the fact that it &apos;s positive , but it means more people have to share in those benefits and recognize them .
we also changed the way we did criminal prosecutions .
and anyone who is interested in doing it in any health care situation , we will be happy to assist you and tell you how we &apos;ve done it , and how you can do it . if we do this , we can change the face of health care in africa .
and the people who avoid that have 30 percent less infectious disease or something .
you &apos;ll notice that the building is rather austere .
much of this progress comes from a method called &quot; &quot; machine learning . &quot; &quot; machine learning is different than traditional programming , where you give the computer detailed , exact , painstaking instructions .
( laughter ) now i &apos;ve got four or five penguins floating around my head , and i &apos;m just sitting there shooting away .
because each of us contains our entire gene code of where we &apos;ve been for the past billion years , because we &apos;ve evolved from that stuff , you can take that tree of life and collapse it back , and in the measure that you learn to reprogram , maybe we &apos;ll give birth to something that is very close to the first primordial ooze .
first of all , i thought , well , we need a sales team , and we clearly aren &apos;t the a-team here , so let &apos;s — i did all this training .
this caused not only problems , obviously , for the countries themselves , but also for the response .
the difference between arts and sciences is also not constructive versus deconstructive , right ? a lot of people think of the sciences as deconstructive .
she tried to look up her oncologist &apos;s phone number on the internet and she found it , but she found something else too .
in fact , without the optimism bias , we would all be slightly depressed .
( applause ) and this has created the space for my femininity to flourish in a way i had never experienced before .
( laughter ) so , you want to know where life is happening ?
so within less than three months of our team being on the ground , we were already able to push our first products to production .
it turned out that justin was almost certainly not autistic .
they believed in collaboration .
so in fact what we have now is a system where we can use people on the ground , people who are already there , who can both improve and use the existing connectivity , and we &apos;re using old cell phones that are being sent to us by people from around the world that want their phones to be doing something else in their afterlife , so to speak .
there are 13 species in the genus , and they have a particular behavior that i think you will find interesting .
with pivot , you can drill into a decade .
mantra stands for movement and action network for transformation of rural areas .
so on this bit of grassland , we &apos;ll do it , but just in the foreground .
but the point is that it &apos;s going to be a massive readjustment .
we &apos;re a visual species . when scientists first realized that bats were actually using sound to be able to fly and orient and move at night , we didn &apos;t believe it .
to perseverate means to focus obsessively and repeatedly on the exact same thing .
we are fighting against this .
and this is a video that was taken by my surgical mentor , dr. john niparko , who implanted her .
so the pulse enters the bottle , our bullet , with a packet of photons that start traveling through and that start scattering inside .
the audience is too small .
our collective optimism is reflected by the growth of biotechnology across the globe , striving to utilize scientific knowledge to cure human diseases .
i used to want to design a utopian society or a perfect world or something like that .
i don &apos;t know what the hell i &apos;m doing here .
we can make that happen , inexpensively .
but this does not follow any of the usual trends .
it &apos;s an amazing experience every time , no matter where you go .
as long as we can stay dry , that &apos;s a bonus .
and the funny thing is they call me mr. rambo in gaza .
i don &apos;t understand why i was never caught .
so far , the best idea i &apos;ve heard about building grit in kids is something called &quot; &quot; growth mindset . &quot; &quot; this is an idea developed at stanford university by carol dweck , and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed , that it can change with your effort .
and they are showing the signs of this .
what you will get is page after page of white , straight russian couples spray-tanned to the point of mahogany .
but as that space shuttle returns to earth , and as the astronauts enter the earth &apos;s gravitational field , they begin to see the effects of gravity .
now , how does it start ? it starts in schools .
this is a painting i did of my wife in my apartment .
so these guys were absolutely crucial .
he didn &apos;t say &quot; &quot; we have a dream . &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; i have a dream . &quot; &quot; why did he do that ? because most people are not at stage five .
but in many other countries , including my country , the us , there &apos;s actually no law on this , so in theory , you could do it .
is the wheel awesome ? say it with me .
it was accidentally released from the aquarium in monaco , it was bred to be cold tolerant to have in peoples aquaria .
so in wildlife rescue as in life , we learn from each previous experience , and we learn from both our successes and our failures .
also , and this makes me extremely proud , a costa rican woman , christiana figueres , played a decisive role in the negotiations of the paris climate agreement .
so , these are reviews of hundreds of studies by all the big muckety-mucks of the scientific pantheon in the united states , and these are the studies that show needle programs are effective — quite a lot of them .
and so here it is in the stomatopod . and again , this is a situation where engineers are very familiar with this phenomenon , because it destroys boat propellers .
it seems that cancer is a direct result to injury .
by the way , the pronunciation is &quot; &quot; eyjafjallajokull . &quot; &quot; none of your media got it right .
audience member 2 : spade .
&quot; &quot; did you hear about eddie ? he died last week .
their aim is to push the boundary of what can be achieved with autonomous flight .
older people usually are the leaders of traditional societies , and the people most knowledgeable about politics , medicine , religion , songs and dances .
but an amazing alternative energy company in paris is taking us off the grid with solar .
the success rate of the nerve transfers is very high .
i finished my quest , i got the girl .
turns out that there are three factors that you optimize for — and each of these are in complete opposite to what you learn at a business school .
in the early days of this modern markets technology , the financial institutions worked out how they could leverage their buying power , their back office processes , their relationships , their networks to shape these new markets that would create all this new activity .
to develop liquid metal battery , i hired students and post-docs and mentored them .
we &apos;re also , on top of that , integrating wireless networking into an affordable device with gps and gsm .
right now , if you want to test water in the field , you need a trained technician , expensive equipment like this , and you have to wait about a day for chemical reactions to take place and provide results .
so most of my work , i don &apos;t use glue .
and then each of these little spheres is the size of the earth in proportion to the sun .
( applause ) the saying is that with climate , those who know the most are the most worried .
my battery was dead . &quot; &quot; your battery wasn &apos;t dead .
ca : dan , i &apos;d like to hear more on this . so , you &apos;re saying that our response to terror is , i mean , it &apos;s a form of mental bug ?
here it is about 40 minutes later .
i wasn &apos;t raised with wealth or resources or any social standing to speak of .
rng : when our great grandchildren look back at us , will they be as appalled by some of our practices as we are by our slave-owning , heretic-burning , wife-beating , gay-bashing ancestors ?
we learned these things from outsiders .
but then , we &apos;re just a community group , you know .
you can see them overlapping .
there are four possible routes through this maze , yet time and time again , the slime mold established the shortest and the most efficient route .
you do that for the course of the transaction , and when you &apos;re done , you liquidate the portfolio , pay back the bonds , and you can give the equity holders a nice return .
♫ here we go , spread my wings and ... ♫ ♫ fly baby ! time to leave that nest ♫ ♫ fly baby ! this ain &apos;t no time to rest . come on ♫ ♫ fly baby ! we got work to do ♫ ♫ here we go . spread my wings and fly . one more time ♫ ♫ fly baby ! time to leave that nest ♫ ♫ fly baby ! this ain &apos;t no time to rest ♫ ♫ fly baby ! we got work to do ♫ ♫ here we go , spread my wings and ... ♫ ♫ fly baby ! fly baby fly ♫ ♫ fly baby ! fly baby high ♫
with the permission of relatives , it exhumed the corpses of refugees who had drowned at europe &apos;s borders , transported them all the way to berlin , and then reburied them at the heart of the german capital .
this is the allen telescope array electronics today .
forty-two million people were displaced by natural disasters in 2010 .
i learned that this indiscriminate weapon was used in so many parts of the world and continues to kill on a regular basis , without distinguishing between a military target or a child .
and it all grew out of one of my colleagues asking me to analyze a bunch of brains of psychopathic killers .
but there is another class of ideas : the rules that govern how we interact with each other ; rules like , let &apos;s have a tax system that supports a research university that gives away certain kinds of knowledge for free .
well , the problem is the source .
and it might be that you kind of like that .
so what i want to propose to you today are four simple techniques — techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues — that you can easily apply in your businesses .
you have not changed the story .
we &apos;ll read a text , we &apos;ll talk about it , we &apos;ll have a potluck dinner .
and we stopped trying to save these lives .
on the other hand , the capacities for positive results in the aftermath of a war are also not to be underestimated , even by , and i would say especially by , people who are deeply skeptical about whether we should go to war in the first place .
it &apos;s the only profession where you have to believe in the future .
they may have many rights .
we had a broader , geographically much wider , constituency we were trying to defend .
and we made this film in casablanca , recreating all the shots .

i mean , the 20 percent of the car drivers that disappeared , surely they must be discontent in a way .
it &apos;s a national tragedy and scandal that the l.a. county jail is the biggest psychiatric facility in the united states .
and musical notation allows me a more nuanced way of translating information without compromising it .
in 1914 it was created or invented by a guy named lp draper .
the economist said a few years ago that there are actually more unredeemed air miles in the world than there are dollar bills in circulation .
and all of them , just like the prophets who get their message from god through gabriel , get their message from above .
it acquires those technologies very early , before they &apos;ve become expensive or competitors have mobilized around them , and it then develops those technologies itself , even at the risk of failure or the risk of self-disruption .
so in this much noisier world , it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more explicit about our moral code .
and i said to him , &quot; &quot; mr. brahimi , is this nuts , going for a global truce ?
some countries have good laws , laws which could stem the tide of hiv .
how would we write the treaty to do that ?
this is at p.s. 1 — a sculpture that &apos;s basically a square room by james turrell , that has a retractable ceiling .
now , flutes may seem ... the distribution of flutes may seem a trivial case .
i &apos;m so angry about it . the oil companies are ripping me off .
this is a big opportunity for prosperity .
last year they saved a billion dollars , 30 billion rubles , from open innovation , and they &apos;re pushing radically the extension of crowdsourcing , not only from banking , but into the public sector .
the architect spent hundreds of hours designing the burnished brass switchplates for his new office tower .
and to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable world .
and we can then create functional livers .
unlike most of our computing devices , these objects are much more fun to use .
and i was just in new york at the launch , and i went to see all these places where they &apos;re installed : this is at a puerto rican little mom-and-pop store ; at a bar in christopher street ; at a pool hall .
imagine what you &apos;ll tell your children when they ask you , &quot; &quot; so , in 2012 , mom and dad , what was it like when you &apos;d had the hottest decade on record for the third decade in a row , when every scientific body in the world was saying you &apos;ve got a major problem , when the oceans were acidifying , when oil and food prices were spiking , when they were rioting in the streets of london and occupying wall street ?
i &apos;d like to introduce you first to this person whose image you may or may not recognize .
these are offices , which , really , in the competition , we didn &apos;t have to design .
sequoia sempervirens is the tallest living organism on earth .
and i tried , and i made it .
our mother , mexico , is being violated before our very eyes .
and then i got my commercial pilot &apos;s license .
this is a new idea that &apos;s crept up that may be , essentially , a cleverer idea than putting sulfates in .
i think this is , obviously , substantially different from anything we &apos;d ever thought about doing before , just by the nature of it .
it &apos;s not to create a technological solution , it &apos;s to seduce you into something that you can do , into something that will please you , something that will lift your spirits , something that will make you feel as if are in another world — such as his nobu restaurant in new york , which is supposed to take you from the clutter of new york city to the simplicity of japan and the elegance of japanese tradition .
its gross wastefulness , all this idle cash , should be energized to improve lives , to develop human talents , and indeed to finance all these technologies , green technologies , which are absolutely essential for saving planet earth .
and just in case you wondered , they shared one toilet in those small confines .
knock knock . is anyone home ?
the dna matched , and we know that this was indeed nicolaus copernicus .
he was turning over 200,000 dollars a week .
there are dress-for-success groups in texas which are using the book , for women who have never been to college .
perhaps you have a computer scientist who &apos;s a genius .
we have to stop .
we tried to answer this simple question : can you find a unifying language that cuts across age and income and culture that will help people themselves find a new way of living , see spaces around them differently , think about the resources they use differently , interact differently ?
after 20 years , we see emerging the debris accumulation zone of the north pacific gyre .
now i said i have over a decade of demonizing stress to redeem myself from , so we are going to do one more intervention .
there &apos;s no real , true balancing going on , and in a sense , the games they play to hide that actually obscure the topic so much that people don &apos;t see things that are actually pretty straight-forward challenges .
it limited the number of fonts you could get on your typesetting system at any one time .
( laughter ) but by the time you get to block nine , you see that respiratory syncytial virus .
what does it feel like to see ?
see , we spent a lot of energy , in many domains — technological , scientific , hard work , creativity , human ingenuity — to crack important social problems with technology solutions .
and we had progress in the free media .
even once the true cause of my disease is discovered , if we don &apos;t change our institutions and our culture , we will do this again to another disease .
i basically take it , prepare it , and then people consume it — hopefully they enjoy it .
interesting — appealing , even — but a little bit odd .
india doesn &apos;t have a military mission there .
we can &apos;t afford mainframe healthcare today to include the uninsured .
( applause )
and the possibility of making a web server for a dollar grew into what became known as the internet of things , which is literally an industry now with tremendous implications for health care , energy efficiency .
but one thing is sure : call it human .
a bit like being in a washing machine .
hp : ( in chinese ) yr : actually , the only way i feel comfortable wearing it is by pretending they are the robes of a kung fu warrior like li mu bai from that film , &quot; crouching tiger , hidden dragon . &quot;
i mean , certainly , soldiers are traumatized and the ones who are have to be treated for that .
except there is a slight tether here , which keeps it from going over the top of its field .
and this was another thing that i felt , while not nearly as romantic as cary grant , nevertheless begins to grab a little bit of aesthetic operation , aesthetic performance into a product .
and that animated graphics can make a difference .
it &apos;s about five kilometers around , counting the dragonflies as i go , trying not to bump into people as i &apos;m looking in the trees .
we forget the words of the writer richard bach who once said , &quot; &quot; intimacy — not connectedness — intimacy is the opposite of loneliness . &quot; &quot; so how do we design for organizational intimacy ?
so you get this sense of urgency , like you need to find as much stuff as possible as soon as possible .
you know , we know almost nothing about them .
we have to beat that .
he started selling surplus parts , kits , to schools and stuff .
you know , your webcam light won &apos;t turn on .
when methane built up , or carbon dioxide built up , or oxygen was diminished , the birds would swoon before people would — so it acted as an early warning system : hey , get out of the mine . things aren &apos;t going so well .
and dengue fever has grown in speed quite phenomenally .
because finally human beings are getting it .
this is not right . it requires thinking .
but belief is not measurable .
and i started spraying that on the streets in cairo .
and he does that every day , and every day , probably , that guy in the picture walks on by , because he sees that little boy , but he doesn &apos;t see him .
a bit more searching through the profile and there &apos;s a photo of their office .
( applause )
east europe , latin america , and oecd countries .
if you say , &quot; &quot; jesus rose from the dead , &quot; &quot; — ooh , trickier .
there &apos;s a lot of research and a lot of failure , trial and error — i guess , more error — that goes into each and every dish , so we don &apos;t always get it right , and it takes a while for us to be able to explain that to people .
liberals and conservatives , democrats and republicans , more and more they just don &apos;t like one another .
in north sulawesi it is the cooperative — they have a democratic culture there , so there you can use the local justice system to protect your system .
so you don &apos;t have to ask any of these guys .
she was like , &quot; &quot; nope . sorry . women are worth it . &quot; &quot; well there was a little piece of that women &apos;s health initiative that went to national heart , lung , and blood institute , which is the cardiology part of the nih .
so we decided to paste white , white on the walls .
in another generation down the line , i think we will have succeeded .
i want to know now . can you help us ? &quot; &quot; so , we launched some tools , we let them track their blood levels .
i &apos;m going to go right into the slides .
pm : and your story , billie , has inspired so many women everywhere .
instead , l.d. has used the u.s. library of congress classification system , including page numbers , to leave me clues .
here &apos;s the design of an early one from toshiba .
( laughter ) yeah , good . yeah .
so in that green component of the brain stem , if you damage it , and often it happens , what you get is complete paralysis , but your conscious mind is maintained .
in 1954 , sir roger bannister became the first man to run under four minutes in the mile .
that pencil-yellow crank was remembered by everybody .
so the goal was to evacuate the target cities .
at this distance , shown in blue on this diagram for stars of different temperatures , planets could be warm enough for water to flow on their surfaces as lakes and oceans where life might reside .
second aspect : i still had crushing migraine headaches .
let &apos;s do some mathy thing , and with luck it &apos;ll work out the answer and try and tell us some interesting things things about related math .
now , the fourth and the most important thing i learned is how you use images to create a positive change .
( applause )
it &apos;s exactly equivalent to taking one 325 milligram aspirin tablet , throwing it into the middle of lake tahoe , and then stirring it up , obviously with a very big stick , and waiting two years or so until the solution is homogeneous .
my grandfather taught me to work with wood when i was a little boy , and he also taught me the idea that if you cut down a tree to turn it into something , honor that tree &apos;s life and make it as beautiful as you possibly can .
if you test men and women , and you ask them questions on totally objective criteria like gpas , men get it wrong slightly high , and women get it wrong slightly low .
we can make spines that catch on simulated debris and collapse on removal to easily pull them out .
the very next day , continuing the totally true story , i got on a g-v to fly to africa to make a speech in nigeria , in the city of lagos , on the topic of energy .
the telescope is actually built similarly to the , well-known to you , hubble space telescope , except it does have an additional lens — a wide-field lens , as you would call it as a photographer .
if you pick your kid up more than 10 minutes late , we &apos;re going to add a 10 shekel fine to your bill .
and believe me , there were no wal-marts or convenience stores out there then , so it really was a form of country living .
and i &apos;m not asking you to take any crazy risks .
this is me buying some duck flavored paste at the ranch 99 in daly city on sunday , november 15th .
it was striking to me because it featured a young black girl , probably around 12 years old , looking studiously at some physics equations .
that is , it provides a wonderful example of where you can go with a real regional initiative .
i could use that for a leg , an arm , anything like that .
and i decided at that moment that i would spend the rest of my life doing whatever i could to improve their possibilities .
so , well , i do applied math , and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied math , is that we are like management consultants .
so , the beauty of mesh networks : you can have these very low-cost devices .
they asked themselves the following question .
and now we can see inside of the brain with a resolution and ability that was never before available , and essentially learn how to reconstruct , and maybe even re-engineer , or backwards engineer , the brain so we can better understand pathology , disease and therapy .
which of those parents here in the room might not lie concerning the whereabouts of your son or daughter in an investigation of a killing ?
they don &apos;t need a huge array of power tools or anything like that , and they can build a small house of about this size in about a day .
if we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging , we will be here all night , because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another .
here &apos;s another way to look at exactly the same problem .
what &apos;s rational for public health is also rational for individual sex workers because it &apos;s really bad for business to have another sti .
and inside these wells , then microbial communities begin to form .
and , in fact , to understand it , i eventually had to create a whole new kind of science .
what i &apos;ve learned over the last years is that you need coalitions of the willing and of the unwilling to make change .
but it was amazing to see that he was also executed on march 29 , 1984 .
it must be so hard teaching those poor , unintelligent kids , &quot; &quot; i bit my lip , because apparently we needed her money more than my students needed their dignity .
that he asked for only one thing — a gift of two healthy sperm whales ?
so , like my mother would say , make a long story short , i just simply said to johnny , &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; he told me to go in his room .
but you have a kind of a set point there , which would be in the middle .
i find it astounding that someone from the shadowy corners of cyberspace can become its voice of opposition , its last line of defense even , perhaps someone like anonymous , the leading brand of global hacktivism .
and , closer to home , chalua , an n.g. road in bangalore .
( laughter ) it &apos;s axiomatic that they &apos;re dodgy , and they &apos;re going to want to try and rip you off .
then they had to bring them in .
well , in the long term , we can shoot towards increasing inter-african trade , removing borders and putting pressure on leaders to fulfill regional agreements they &apos;ve already signed .
that &apos;s as bizarre as finding that the antarctic on the earth is hotter than the tropics .
this is followed by a text panel , it &apos;s designed in scroll form , in which i construct the narrative at stake .
and costa rica &apos;s not alone .
this is the first time that we want sex over time about pleasure and connection that is rooted in desire .
we had all sorts of help from all walks of life .
what &apos;s , again , amazing are these temperatures .
we need to dream , we need to be creative , and we all need to have an adventure in order to create miracles in the darkest of times .
excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming , it &apos;s also changing ocean chemistry , making the sea more acidic .
nature is nano .
so we decided to take portraits of palestinians and israelis doing the same jobs — taxi-driver , lawyer , cooks .
you &apos;d be activating the dorsal stream if you did that .
to do that i &apos;m going to talk about my research as an economist on the epidemic .
not exclusive to these things , but in addition to them , is propagating a genuine demand for democracy on the ground .
and whether that &apos;s because of food production , or because of the introduction of alien plants into places that they really oughtn &apos;t be , or because of habitats being used for other purposes — all these things are meaning that plants have to adapt , or die , or move .
so what do you think happens when you pat a twentysomething on the head and you say , &quot; &quot; you have 10 extra years to start your life &quot; &quot; ?
they used to tell their neighbors and friends , &quot; our son , he &apos;s taking a gap decade . &quot;
he was delighted .
second , is you measure the altitude of deneb .
but this time , the chinese didn &apos;t buy it .
dry .
the last ice age started roughly 120,000 years ago .
we treat many more children then we actually work with .
but at some point , knowledge gives out .
firstly , sex work is and always has been a survival strategy for all kinds of unpopular minority groups : people of color , migrants , people with disabilities , lgbtq people , particularly trans women .
it &apos;s high on capital , chemistry and machines , and it &apos;s never produced anything really good to eat .
but we need to get to a stage when you &apos;re an atheist and someone says , &quot; &quot; well you know , i did pray the other day , &quot; &quot; you politely ignore it .
and my parents thought it was cute , so they didn &apos;t bring it up , but when i got into school , they didn &apos;t really agree that it was cute .
now , brunel was working 100 years before the emergence of the design profession , but i think he was using design thinking to solve problems and to create world-changing innovations .
this redesign of the diet coke can by turner duckworth is to me truly a piece of art .
and he wrote to the academicians in paris , trying to explain his theory .
but you know the problem : we can &apos;t make people rent to folks that they don &apos;t want to rent to .
we had a savanna , a marsh , a desert .
if you make people self-conscious about their judgments , studies show you will make them make worse judgments .
why is it so easy to learn ?
this is a work of some proportion and some weight that makes the body into a city , an aggregation of cells that are all interconnected and that allow certain visual access at certain places .
so jude said , &quot; &quot; okay , i &apos;ll do some statements for you . &quot; &quot; while i was filming these statements , he said to me , &quot; &quot; where are you going next ? &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m going to go to afghanistan . &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; really ? &quot; &quot; and i could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest .
so for example this would be one sentence , and you would get this sort of green region and the red polyalanine , that repeats over and over and over again , and you can have that hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times within an individual silk molecule .
alright . let &apos;s leave that .
the other set of reasons for variation in the treatment of the elderly is the society &apos;s cultural values .
if you have more consideration for others , you will have a caring economics , where finance is at the service of society and not society at the service of finance .
the nice thing is that these gold particles actually made it all the way to the tumor , and then they shine out and tell us , &quot; &quot; hey , we &apos;re here . here &apos;s the tumor . &quot; &quot; so now we can see the tumor , but we &apos;re not showing this to the doctor yet .
&quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; wrote the psychiatrist viktor frankl , &quot; &quot; is the last of the human freedoms : to choose one &apos;s attitude in any given set of circumstances . &quot; &quot; i wished to tell him that not only paralyzers and paralyzees must evolve , reconcile to reality , but we all must — the aging and the anxious and the divorced and the balding and the bankrupt and everyone .
so they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing .
but it &apos;s much faster than conventional farming .
if airports can become shopping malls and mcdonald &apos;s can become playgrounds , surely we can reinvent the clinic waiting room .
come to — no , no , no , no .
so that &apos;s what we did , and long story short , we were booed off the stage , and if you ever have a chance to live your life escaping hearing the sound of an auditorium full of second- and third-graders booing , i would highly recommend it . it &apos;s not really fun .
well , let me just say , that was a graphic . i just want to show this picture .
we don &apos;t know the answer to that either , but we will learn that answer this year , thanks to nasa &apos;s kepler space telescope , and in fact , the smart money , which is to say the people who work on this project , the smart money is suggesting that the fraction of planets that might be suitable for life is maybe one in a thousand , one in a hundred , something like that .
but it does suggest that that number might be a little big .
for each of these successful authoritarian governments in east asia , there &apos;s a matched failure .
they simply threw everything at us .
but i should say a few words about what &apos;s going on .
but with that , we were going to gain freedom : freedom to hire the teachers that we knew were going to be effective ; freedom to control the curriculum so that we &apos;re not doing lesson 1.2 on page five , no ; and freedom to control a budget , to spend money where it matters , not how a district or a state says you have to do it .
our modern world is based on a global network of information exchange made possible , in large part , by our ability to communicate — in particular , using graphic or written forms of communication .
all of our hopes and dreams , what we want to accomplish , is different , and our paths will be different , they are all stories .
you have to make a wish to save the world . &quot; &quot; i was lost .
and during the break there would be a snack and you could choose bananas or chocolate .
with the exception perhaps of a massive earthquake , we &apos;re protected from real awe .
place cells are also being recorded in humans .
so that &apos;s my talk .
this wasn &apos;t what we were looking for .
but moreover , i &apos;d never lived on an uninhabited island .
this was published after he died : his sort of unfinished notes on self-reproducing machines , what it takes to get the machines sort of jump-started to where they begin to reproduce .
and lo and behold , glucose went up 20 to 60 milligrams per deciliter in the mice .
so the pup you see on the bottom is affected by atrazine that its grandmother was exposed to .
we &apos;re trying to change that .
so it follows : we should not expect to see a boiling river .
well , it opens up new possibilities .
lt : i mean , i still work alone .
the defibrillators allow a physician at a distance to give a shock to a heart in case a patient needs it .
we tweak that a lot .
but in the end , the only thing i could say for sure was , &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; and that just might be the most profoundly religious statement of all .
it &apos;s actually a story in which our acts themselves are pushing the story in a particular way .
this is why you have checks and balances .
you have to design an artificial foot for such conditions .
this can sometimes have unintended consequences . ok .
they would hope that in each of these district offices , an officer would get the letter , would open it , read it and then forward it to the next level , which was the block offices .
people envision this as being very difficult .
at worst , they ruin lives : weight obsession leads to eating disorders , especially in young kids .
and that &apos;s unlike many of our competitors .
it is one thing to say , we need to recycle the teachers , we need the directors to do more .
mine isn &apos;t .
we &apos;re an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing .
so they have all the criteria that people normally like .
that &apos;s a good close-up of that one .
chris anderson : you turn up the dials , the wheel starts to turn .
we &apos;re saying that you cannot solve the problem of climate change in one country ; you &apos;ve got to involve all countries .
we know that race was a factor , and the reason why we know that is because we asked those people .
thank you .
&quot; i &apos;ve talked to them too , and same story . &quot;
you know , audiences like you , yeah , make the event .
my dream is to create the conditions for world peace in my lifetime — and to do that by creating the conditions for inner peace and compassion on a global scale .
and so the authorities became convinced that this smell was this problem .
that &apos;s the word &quot; &quot; retard &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; retarded &quot; &quot; used in a derogatory manner .
in genomics now , the genome cost about a billion dollars about 10 years ago when the first one came out .
if you just take influenza , you will see peaks at the time where you knew big flu epidemics were killing people around the globe .
if the critic was among the optically activated cells , the result of this intervention should be a change in policy .
and that &apos;s an up-close picture of a lotus leaf .
so street salsa , championship tango , it &apos;s all the same — he leads , she follows .
many mornings , i had to go to the border area to collect a journalist .
king abdullah has picked up on the idea .
so this lower bar is the upper atmosphere , the stratosphere , and it heats up after these volcanoes .
ron williamson . ron was convicted of the rape and murder of a barmaid at a club , and served 11 years of a death sentence .
i &apos;m intrigued by a concept that was brought to life in the early part of the 19th century — actually , in the second decade of the 19th century — by a 27-year-old poet whose name was percy shelley .
first of all , it &apos;s planted , and that takes energy .
i wanted to go from where i was to where i wanted to be , for which i needed something .
sometimes , focusing on what &apos;s heroic , beautiful and dignified , regardless of the context , can help magnify these intangibles three ways , in the protagonist of the story , in the audience , and also in the storyteller .
according to diversityinc , a study of their top 50 companies for diversity outperformed the s &amp; p 500 by 25 percent .
because transitions are dangerous times .
but then the really shocking question occurred to me : if he could die , could it happen to me too ?
and while the theologies and the practices vary very much between these independent communities , what we can see are some common , consistent threads between them .
it &apos;s just an experiment .
this is working with marshall mcluhan .
not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody &apos;s life , but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one .
great leaders understand that having a more diverse network is a source of pattern identification at greater levels and also of solutions , because you have people that are thinking differently than you are .
i mean , think about it : the care we take in selecting sunglasses , or jewelry , or accessories is really important , so if it isn &apos;t beautiful , it really doesn &apos;t belong on your face .
it &apos;s the world department .
and then we need to use less again .
it will refer you directly to your congressperson , to your u.s. senator , to your governor where divestment legislation is pending .
so then i would kind of justify not writing by giving a gift .
the most mysterious part of forests is the upper tree canopy .
or ryan , who can &apos;t go to school , because his immune deficient daughter can &apos;t be risked to have germs come into the house , so he couldn &apos;t leave the house .
i know that &apos;s an absurd notion .
( laughter ) &quot; you &apos;ve served so well . &quot; ( laughter )
sounds impossible , doesn &apos;t it ?
not only can we think , we must .
why on earth are you crocheting a reef ?
the tunnels are famous for having been used by the resistance , which victor hugo wrote about in &quot; &quot; les miserables . &quot; &quot; and i saw a lot of graffiti from the 1800s , like this one .
that &apos;s how we did it in the pre-ted.com days .
they haven &apos;t been convicted of any crime ; they haven &apos;t pled guilty to any offense .
the trick is to join them up , to use food as a way of seeing .
how can i , as a private citizen , use the report card to create pressure for action ?
he said , &quot; &quot; philippe , you have been had .
and it &apos;s really easy to see where innovation &apos;s going on .
it &apos;s a lady named leslie aiello .
here is the old story — we &apos;ve already heard a little bit about it : biology is war in which only the fiercest survive ; businesses and nations succeed only by defeating , destroying and dominating competition ; politics is about your side winning at all costs .
we &apos;d love to help .
there are a number of groups that are proposing that life evolved at these vent sites .
i often don &apos;t think about it .
her dream of going to school , her wish of being educated , is finally here .
the following calculations are made every 20 milliseconds , or 50 times per second .
we evolved as a species near the equator , and so we &apos;re very well-equipped to deal with 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness .
and it &apos;s especially important to rebuild them for lawsuits .
and they themselves had not known they cared .
the second point i want to make about the favelas is , you &apos;ve got to open spaces in the favela .
and why are they upset ? because they have nothing to do .
they paddle faster , and faster , and faster , until they &apos;re going so fast that they literally lift up out of the water , and they &apos;re standing upright , sort of paddling the top of the water .
but if we did this in every single — every fire hydrant we could redefine the emergency .
or in the case of double agents and traitors , like robert hanssen or aldrich ames , lies can betray our country , they can compromise our security , they can undermine democracy , they can cause the deaths of those that defend us .
my daughter katelyn , my 15-year-old , she and i were in the car , and we were driving down the road , and she was sitting there , and she had this idea , and she goes , &quot; &quot; dad , i &apos;ve got this idea . &quot; &quot; and so i listened to her idea and i said , &quot; &quot; katelyn , that &apos;s impossible . &quot; &quot; and she looks at me and she goes , &quot; &quot; dad , after what you just did , how can you call anything impossible ? &quot; &quot; and i laughed , and i said , &quot; &quot; ok , it &apos;s not impossible , it &apos;s just very , very hard . &quot; &quot; and then i paused for a second , and i said , &quot; &quot; katelyn , it may not be impossible , it may not even be very , very hard ,
now i remember that dinner i had with the minister of fisheries 10 years ago when we first brought this up and i got quite animated during the dinner and said , &quot; &quot; well , i think that the conservation community might embrace this idea , minister . &quot; &quot; he paused and put his hands together and said , &quot; &quot; yes , greg , but the devil will be in the details , &quot; &quot; he said .
they &apos;re the only ones that are dangerous .
and the same kind of technology — it &apos;s called dna barcoding , it &apos;s really cool — you can use it to check if your caviar is really beluga , if that sushi is really tuna , or if that goat cheese that you paid so much for is really goat &apos;s .
he would say , &quot; &quot; look , can you believe they have a mango here from mexico ?
let &apos;s start with the definition of schizophrenia .
but we can &apos;t do everything .
the biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you &apos;re designing there &apos;s actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form of the trailer .
beyond that , i didn &apos;t see anyone for 10 weeks .
this is a shot of cannery row in 1932 .
this is just like video conferencing today .
it really started from the destruction of the idea that the government is there because it &apos;s our government , meant to protect the larger public interest .
we have to send the fathers to de-addiction labs and when they come back , most times sober , we have to find a job for them so that they don &apos;t regress .
universes are opened and closed continually .
it only got a 500 , it could have gotten as high up as a 1,000 . &quot; &quot; and this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors into being approved as a car seat .
but of course , there &apos;s another story to this building .
for every nine people who have been executed , we &apos;ve actually identified one innocent person who &apos;s been exonerated and released from death row .
what do we know ? what do people do in these kinds of situations ?
ordinarily you wouldn &apos;t think so , but we &apos;re expecting an e , it &apos;s good enough , and yeah , i &apos;ve seen an e , and then apple says , &quot; yeah , i &apos;ve seen an apple . &quot;
we started using this technique in other problems , and i &apos;m going to tell you about a fascinating problem that we encountered , a case of dystonia .
if you &apos;re sitting in japan , or in new delhi , or in hanoi , your view of the rise of china is a little different than if you &apos;re sitting in beijing .
and so part of my goal is actually to change that and to educate and engage with the public and get you guys talking about this .
a toy gun where you shoot cola and get someone soaking wet ?
is it just literally for control , for hand-stick control ? why am i doing that ?
so for all domestic needs , women have to carry water .
developing the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidly depending on the demands of the situation , that &apos;s what you &apos;ve got to learn to do .
in conclusion , i am a scientist and a dreamer .
the next project i want to show was given to me in an email from a stranger .
not many people . okay .
migrants send money home , but they also save a large amount of money where they live .
that was the speech in which he coined that term .
( laughter ) at the beginning of each class , the professor would call on somebody to present the case .
they &apos;re also silicon .
redwood rainforest is incredibly difficult to move through , and even today , individual trees are being discovered that have never been seen before , including , in the summer of 2006 , hyperion , the world &apos;s tallest tree .
not by the latest combine and tractor invention , but by fertile land ; not by pumps , but by fresh water ; not by chainsaws , but by forests ; and not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the sea .
so what ?
and the audiences of storytellers are often deeply compassionate and empathetic people .
but as these conversations unfolded , i experienced what alice must have when she went down that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world .
if you bite into an organic or conventional papaya that is infected with the virus , you will be chewing on tenfold more viral protein .
as seymour showed back in the 1970s , flies , like songbirds , as you just heard , are capable of learning .
this little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren &apos;t .
and she said , &quot; &quot; well , now that i can walk again , i can go back and complete my studies . &quot; &quot; and to me she represents the next generation of engineers solving problems and ensuring meaningful technologies reach their users .
and in fact , the way that we can communicate today — where alaska is instantly knowing what &apos;s going on in china , and the kiwis did this , and then over in england they tried to ...
and yet , they can find them by tactile discrimination , and they can press it and select it .
and the light that falls onto our eyes is determined by multiple things in the world , not only the color of objects , but also the color of their illumination , and the color of the space between us and those objects .
it &apos;s how they understand access to this culture .
so that suggests to us that our sense of self does not end at the last layer of the epithelium of our bodies , but it ends at the last layer of electrons of the tools that we &apos;re commanding with our brains .
( laughter ) are you an ethical consumer worried about what the drugs industry is doing ?
it gets very expensive to do this research .
michael moriarty : specialist michael moriarty .
how can we make it more successful ?
they reverse-engineer manuals .
how else to describe this , but as a form of mass insanity ?
we made mistakes . we should expect mistakes .
in particular , there &apos;s a medication , valproic acid , which mothers with epilepsy sometimes take , we know can increase that risk of autism .
and everything from the kidney , to the testes , to the back bone , to the fin muscle to — i think that ís pretty much the whole fish — is eaten .
and here is a picture of the khmer rouge .
he &apos;s at about 40 to 50 percent of his previous performance before the lesion .
if we didn &apos;t have this present moment , we wouldn &apos;t have any opportunity to do anything or experience anything , and this moment is a gift .
so , all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them , and i think as designers we need to really think about how we can create a different relationship between our work and the world , whether it &apos;s for business , or , as i &apos;m going to show , on some civic-type projects .
and you can basically see that the richer a country is , the older the people are within it .
we &apos;ll make a new film about this process .
so , 27 years ago i got a traffic ticket that got me thinking .
in a deep , dark canyon off the coast of california , we found the first biofluorescent swellshark , right underneath all the surfers .
what &apos;s the point of that ?
&quot; &quot; bad bear , bad bear ! &quot; &quot; voom !
how can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full dexterity of our hands ?
( applause )
now when i screamed at my children to stop , sometimes they would both say to me the other person hit them harder .
i have a fairly bad memory , and dishonesty would always get me in trouble , if i , like — so i &apos;ve just sort of been naturally honest and naturally inquisitive , and that sort of leads to that kind of science .
they truly perform as they transform through time and as communities negotiate the spaces and boundaries and resources .
this satellite covers the whole of africa and goes back as far as 1984 , and that &apos;s important , because if you know how many times a place has had a drought in the last 30 years , you can make a pretty good estimate what the chances are of drought in the future , and that means that you can put a price tag on the risk of drought .
we put waste water and some source of co2 into our floating structure , and the waste water provides nutrients for the algae to grow , and they sequester co2 that would otherwise go off into the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas .
and when you find a lone nut doing something great , have the guts to be the first one to stand up and join in .
i call them lessons to change the world .
i love being around these big wind generators .
the science risk was under control .
wait for it .
this is your life . this is ... this is ... this is your life .
or will some of the metallic objects launched from the earth spawn new oases , a post-human life elsewhere ?
they were using parks they weren &apos;t using before .
today , though , i ’ m going to talk about darwin ’ s other strange inversion , which is equally puzzling at first , but in some ways just as important .
nature naturally has allowed carbon dioxide to go up to 280 parts per million .
after energy production , livestock is the second-highest contributor to atmosphere-altering gases .
and the purity of the music makes you hear it very effectively .
these are also , these tar-fueled protocells , are also able to locate resources in their environment .
computers sort of came around through games and toys .
thank you .
but then i found out , it already is .
otto marseus , nice painting , which is &quot; &quot; still life &quot; &quot; at the pitti gallery , and just have an infrared camera peering through , and luckily for art historians , it just was confirmed that there is a signature of otto marseus . it even says when it was made and also the location .
so there is , in china , there is a different kind of mechanism to be responsive to the demands and the thinking of the people .
and so it &apos;s very difficult to get there , if you do it physically .
and so there is this other unique material trait that these materials have , that they &apos;re programmably degradable .
and i invite you all to be part of the conversation .
so , you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually moving away from the light , toward the dark foundations .
now we have to get through the ice .
so they can use the 1984 scenario data mining of the dissident .
if there &apos;s a real rose there , those molecules will be the ones , but even if there &apos;s no rose there , you &apos;ll have the memory of a molecule .
i write fiction sci-fi thrillers , so if i say &quot; &quot; killer robots , &quot; &quot; you &apos;d probably think something like this .
&#91; arabic &#93; and this roughly translates : &quot; &quot; please , let me hold your hand .
we &apos;re working with the guy who invented the seawater greenhouse .
but most importantly , it &apos;ll be a tremendous expansion of human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology , which in some sense we &apos;re doing already .
now imaginative people have been having fun with this for over 400 years .
i use planet earth to go in very extreme environments where conditions were similar to those of mars at the time when the climate changed , and there i &apos;m trying to understand what happened .
it &apos;s pressure from the human population hunting and destroying their habitats which has done so .
but as the social researcher charles murray has documented , as we started to automate the economy , and 1960 is just about when computers started to be used by businesses , as we started to progressively inject technology and automation and digital stuff into the economy , the fortunes of bill and ted diverged a lot .
and it &apos;s been the same in every single room , in every town that we &apos;ve ever told our story .
and so i want to tell you today about baxter , which we &apos;ve been talking about .
first , soon , and then a lot .
this is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand — it &apos;s all about sex tips .
tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels .
we live in an incredibly busy world .
( applause )
here &apos;s another view of the same .
it &apos;s a 40-year-old company , it understands manufacturing .
so i spent three months in kenya , uganda and tanzania interviewing entrepreneurs that had received 100 dollars to start or grow a business .
how can that not make you feel optimistic for the future ?
this guy up here ?
when people think of holmes , they think of his nemesis being professor moriarty , right , this criminal mastermind .
there &apos;s a number , five to 10 countries in africa that has the same level as sweden and united states .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong .
this is an unnamed species of copepod . a copepod is a crustacean .
we did our best to find reasons to laugh .
too small for detection , it &apos;s your built-in protection .
i learned that success isn &apos;t a one-way street .
now , what good is it to have that ?
for almost five years i stayed there , and we focused on fighting a war that was unconventional and it was difficult and it was bloody and it often claimed its highest price among innocent people .
chris anderson : we had edward snowden here a couple days ago , and this is response time .
i don &apos;t have to be paying attention to what i hear .
so it &apos;s time we make a promise of a world in which we &apos;ve broken the stranglehold that nuclear weapons have on our imaginations ; in which we invest in the creative solutions that come from working backward from the future we desperately want , rather than plodding forward from a present that brings all of the mental models and biases of the past with it .
second question : what causes these changes ?
we &apos;ve watched the financial markets that we uniquely create — these markets that were supposed to be foolproof — we &apos;ve watched them kind of collapse before our eyes .
at the same time , a civil war was taking place in el salvador , and again , the civilian population was caught up in the conflict .
so let &apos;s send into this graph a bunch of tiny , digital marbles and let them go randomly through the graph .
there were 93 of us , and we were all below deck .
so we see some green shoots that things are getting better .
so honeybees are important for their role in the economy as well as in agriculture .
and when he saw i was painting in arabic , he got so mad — actually , hysterical — and he asked for the wall to be erased .
the striking thing about it is that only face recognition is impaired ; everything else is just fine .
so , it &apos;s not a palm pilot by any stretch of the imagination , but it has a thumb-scroll so you can do everything with one hand .
we wish we &apos;d gotten more of it .
and finally , she has a dermatitis on the fingers of her right hand , a dermatitis that is unique to the linoleum factory workers in burntisland . &quot; &quot; and when bell actually strips the patient , begins to examine the patient , you can only imagine how much more he would discern .
a momentous thing that can happen to a culture is they can acquire a new style of arguing : trial by jury , voting , peer review , now this . right ?
its closest relative is , in fact , from mice , and so we would call this a xenotropic retrovirus , because it &apos;s infecting a species other than mice .
and in the life that everyone sees , who i am is a friend , a son , a brother , a stand-up comedian and a teenager .
for what it &apos;s worth , we went to sagres , which was considered , at the time , to be the end of the world .
they &apos;re molecules that protect other molecules as they move through a cell .
it started on a given day , and then the students would watch videos on a weekly basis and do homework assignments .
these are community affairs , by the way .
look , i can prove this to you : here &apos;s a little lottery .
so they copy each other .
this worked .
i &apos;m not talking about the kind of technology that has enveloped our lives , and that people come to ted to hear about .
that &apos;s the only way they are effective .
( applause ) i have a cd here . i &apos;m sorry that i didn &apos;t say anything on time .
and for dollars , is their 30 million , plus the 20 million dollars from the american manufacturer .
you don &apos;t have to dig deep down underground .
now we have taken on a second thing , and this gets to my wish .
it is february and not lying is impossible . &quot; &quot; and i really spend a lot of time wondering , how much truth do we tell ?
( laughter ) but that &apos;s the work i &apos;m doing with biosentient corporation trying to figure out how do we integrate these things ?
there &apos;s no dynamic , there &apos;s no highs or lows , if everything is awesome .
this is just the grassroots stuff again , ok ?
this is a pretty involved process ; it took us about four and a half years .
and all of you need to have it embedded in your brains and to organize yourselves around it .
he took owl monkeys , wired them up so that a computer watched their brains while they moved , especially looking at the movement of their right arm .
his current obsession is to leave lebanon at any cost — even if it meant embarking on a hazardous journey along with refugees drifting towards europe today through the mediterranean .
i am a nomadic artist .
rather than just cutting costs , you need to think about initiatives that will enable you to win in the medium term , initiatives to drive growth , actions that will fundamentally change the way the company operates , and very importantly , investments to develop the leadership and the talent .
it &apos;s now two years that you &apos;ve been running ?
( video ) computer : a cat lying on a bed in a blanket .
it matters for now . it matters as soon as possible .
it is in our dna to be curious .
we decorated every bulletin board in that building with bright , colorful , and positive messages .
but as humans with hearts , we can all rejoice in the unity of life , and perhaps we can change what once happened in that sacred cave .
they touched me when i was four and i lost my eyesight and was partially paralyzed .
we &apos;re looking at building on some of the most precious resources of africa : people .
and i &apos;ve never really felt very motivated by pecking orders or by superchickens or by superstars .
and it &apos;s found in cotton fields , and coltan mines , and even car washes in norway and england .
and do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error and not machine error , and can therefore be prevented by machines ?
but this man doesn &apos;t need to go there .
look at the solar system , and look at the earth .
( applause ) our friends in law enforcement have much to do , because we &apos;ve seen that online violence is an extension of in-person violence .
today there are approximately 6.8 billion people in the world , and within our lifetime , that number &apos;s going to grow to about nine billion .
and so sometimes these analogous experiences , analogous role-play , can also be quite valuable .
just in the past couple years , we &apos;ve seen digital tools display skills and abilities that they never , ever had before , and that kind of eat deeply into what we human beings do for a living .
and language can &apos;t be understood in its abstraction .
this is one of those alternatives .
and there &apos;s things that no one &apos;s voice can do .
and that &apos;s not a good experience , to leave a gallery like that .
it was something i read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in iraq . and she said , &quot; save a man from drowning , you are responsible to him for life . &quot;
i told you last year , i &apos;ll tell you again , my mother was born in egypt , and i — who am i ?
&quot; &quot; you want me to deliver human rights throughout my global supply chain .
but you might not realize that our ability to look into the body in this simple way , using our senses , is quite recent .
and i resemble that remark .
these models are around a million lines of code at this point , and growing by tens of thousands of lines of code every year .
you show all these interconnections , all these interrelations .
( &quot; &quot; what &apos;s a jurassic park ? &quot; &quot; ) now , what is the story here ?
i do not want to have my opinions challenged .
in essence , could we &quot; &quot; app &quot; &quot; chemistry ?
so i traveled there last year , and part of the joy i had in going there was going to these caves .
ak : it &apos;s a great question , or , said better , this is a question we &apos;ve been receiving in the media for possibly the last year .
when in &apos; 96 i was sent by the united nations high commissioner for refugees to the north caucasus , i knew some of the risks .
so amazon went for six years without returning any profit to investors , and people had patience .
it was instrumental in stopping commercial whaling , and was built on the idea that if we couldn &apos;t save whales , what could we save ?
for example , ship captains needed to know information about the tides in order to safely dock at ports .
and so they gave me this name : kè , which means to overcome or to conquer , and wén , and that &apos;s the character for literature or the arts .
they gave her just a couple of months to live .
the matching idea has been successfully used to match , for instance , students with university places , to match kidney donors with patients , and it underlies the kind of algorithms that exist on dating websites .
he started , as i mentioned , to get in the room with evil , to not denounce , and became almost obsequious when he won the nickname serbio , for instance , and even when he negotiated with the khmer rouge would black-box what had occurred prior to entering the room .
this is a child , and what you &apos;re seeing here is real data , and on the far right-hand side , where everything starts getting a little bit catastrophic , that is the patient going into cardiac arrest .
we finance anything that a media company would need , from printing presses to transmitters .
there &apos;s also a great deal , i think , of religious illiteracy around .
there &apos;s lust , which is just wanting to have sex .
na : well the yemen times , across 20 years , has been through so much .
we don &apos;t work from offices .
so from sixth through 12th grade , once , twice , sometimes three times a week , i would take classes at the art museum , and i was surrounded by other kids who loved to draw , other kids who shared a similar passion .
fg : no . not now either .
in addition to the supply levers that we can push — and remember , we need large amounts , because at the moment , we get 90 percent of our energy from fossil fuels — in addition to those levers , we could talk about other ways of solving this issue .
even now , man may be unwittingly changing the world &apos;s climate through the waste products of his civilization .
but we do have the first three minutes .
they dumped us there .
i &apos;m not really sure what &apos;s on the other side of this hill .
i want to start with a story , a la seth godin , from when i was 12 years old .
this animation from my friends at proton studios shows looking at the big bang from the outside .
we take their supply chain , we take all the factory names , we do a random sample , we send inspectors on an unannounced basis to inspect those facilities , and then we publish the results .
( laughter ) we writers , we kind of do have that reputation , and not just writers , but creative people across all genres , it seems , have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable .
it &apos;s because i &apos;m seeing an equation and they &apos;re dealing with exponents and that 30 percent that i didn &apos;t know is showing up .
but this is it .
i mean , i could tell you hundreds of them .
so , and you get all the disease-protective substances .
does that mean we &apos;ve doubled the number of pieces of information we need to know , from 120 to 240 ?
but we can &apos;t have a system that closes that data off , because it is too rich of a source of inspiration , innovation and discovery for new things in medicine .
next i worked with the japanese agency , aq , on a research project into mental health .
you can step on the scale .
so bageye is bald and has baggy eyes .
susan parks of penn state has actually studied this .
but there &apos;s a unity of some sort that &apos;s starting to emerge .
the results of this kind of work are simple and they &apos;re powerful .
it &apos;s so amazing , it &apos;s so exciting .
and they grow and grow by stages . and they climb out of the water , burst out , as the adult which we see .
and so they did something that &apos;s really radical , when you think about how government is used to working .
governments get elected , and then they fall below 50 percent approval in a few months and stay there and get worse until the next election .
so our children are getting larger , but at the same time we are growing into different directions .
( laughter ) it &apos;s in all seven continents , including antarctica .
in britain , it could mean looking to the french , learning from the french , getting directly elected mayors in place in a french commune system .
metal peppered his face .
but what i &apos;d like to talk about today is the fact that this morning , about a billion people on earth — or one out of every seven — woke up and didn &apos;t even know how to fill this cup .
one billion grains of sand come into existence in the world each second .
so as an academic , we &apos;re always trained to be able to jump through hoops to raise funding for our labs , and we get our robots to do that .
we &apos;ve seen what happens when we divide an already small planet into smaller islands .
i think that torajans socially recognize and culturally express what many of us feel to be true despite the widespread acceptance of the biomedical definition of death , and that is that our relationships with other humans , their impact on our social reality , doesn &apos;t cease with the termination of the physical processes of the body , that there &apos;s a period of transition as the relationship between the living and the dead is transformed but not ended .
in this talk today , i want to present a different idea for why investing in early childhood education makes sense as a public investment .
there &apos;s a lot of information here .
so i started doubting myself and wondering what was the real purpose of this whole project ?
it was in far western new south wales .
and we don &apos;t even know the shape of the language .
it should be thought of as a biological moonshot with a timetable .
( laughter ) of course it &apos;s meant to be funny , but in all seriousness , suicidal ideation is quite common with traumatic brain injuries .
so , this it isn &apos;t something that is still undergoing lab tests .
i forgot my discretion .
the musicians hate them .
the warriors won the game and went on to win the championship .
but densification is not going to work everywhere .
now , i think one of the reasons — i &apos;ll try to convince you today — is that we have a fundamental misconception about the power of time .
how are you trying to uplift nutrition and survival and literacy so these countries can take care of themselves , and say wow , this is going well , and be smarter .
so suppose your goal is to get kids into school .
so we can now , in a matter of hours , determine a whole human genome .
but frankly there are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from nyu , have them go study for a semester at the university of arkansas , and vice versa . do it at the high school level .
why ? why do we have to be left out ?
that &apos;s what your genes are doing every day .
you can imagine what it was like in the winter at 10,000 feet .
i can &apos;t think of a single general principle of biology that does not have an exception somewhere by some organism .
it &apos;s a beautiful day .
we talked to 600 drug addicts in three cities in indonesia , and we said , &quot; &quot; well , do you know how you get hiv ? &quot; &quot; &quot; oh yeah , by sharing needles . &quot;
well , it &apos;s been 18 years now since verdana and georgia were released .
it &apos;s just part of your neighborly duty .
and so , you know , 390 percent approval rating ain &apos;t so bad .
sometimes it shows you what you shouldn &apos;t do .
and this is the wire opera theater . we did it in two months .
i don &apos;t know how many of you might imagine it , but there &apos;s actually a tedster who recently got back from iraq .
this has changed .
in 2002 , a group of treatment activists met to discuss the early development of the airplane .
so that is a non-zero-sum dynamic .
notice how few barriers there are to movement across all of the oceans compared to land .
that was the last month for the year of the horse .
it &apos;s a wonderful day in our country &apos;s history ; it &apos;s a wonderful day in the globe &apos;s history to be able to have an actual sitting president say , enough of this — first to himself , and then to the rest of the world .
i mean , it &apos;s the same story . it &apos;s just different names .
in my experience , in fact , the light footprint was extremely helpful .
now , in a word , the answer is &quot; &quot; rules . &quot; &quot; bad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that &apos;s available when people can bring new technologies in and make them available to someone like nelson .
animals are not just raw materials .
all right .
and the hell creek project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find , and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them .
so today what you have is what i call the middle 40 percent , the people who are not in the top 10 and who are not in the bottom 50 , and what you can view as the wealth middle class that owns 20 to 30 percent of total wealth , national wealth , whereas they used to be poor , a century ago , when there was basically no wealth middle class .
if you look at the scene , egypt , for 30 years , had been in a downhill — going into a downhill .
and let me give you a few illustrations .
and so i can generate a force feedback .
and there &apos;s five or six different compilations there , but each one of those compilations reflects input from hundreds of these kinds of records from corals .
but i do think it &apos;s an important conversation .
so it blinks one second after you do .
if you look up high enough , you could see me .
( laughter ) which isn &apos;t a great idea .
and this brings us to our third part of the exercise , which is to draw how to make toast , but this time in a group .
in fact , in go , there are more possible moves than there are atoms in the universe .
we &apos;ve shared transportation .
and then 10 years from now , billions will again have gone into africa , and we would still have the same problems .
and we might be able to find evidence of our own origin in the most unlikely place , and this place in mars .
instead of thinking about what to build , building in order to think .
so i hope there aren &apos;t too many psychologists in this audience .
but online , everybody speaks at the same speed .
we surround ourselves with people who feel the same way we do , and we approve each other , and that &apos;s a really good feeling .
number two : free trade .
we also studied vineet nayar at hcl technologies , an indian outsourcing company .
but sometimes we are only five doctors and 16 nurses , and we are physically getting exhausted to see all of them .
we knew they worked through old-fashioned trial and error .
and so most of you aren &apos;t tackling oppressive regimes on the weekends , so i wanted to think of a few examples that might be a little bit more relatable .
( applause ) thank you .
and having the goal in mind , thinking about where it might lead , directed me to a life of looking at all of the small details to allow this to become possible , to be able to launch and go help build a space station where you are on board a million-pound creation that &apos;s going around the world at five miles a second , eight kilometers a second , around the world 16 times a day , with experiments on board that are teaching us what the substance of the universe is made of and running 200 experiments inside .
so the first unproven claim is that you can use brain scans to read people &apos;s thoughts and emotions .
he &apos;s become the head of art center , and there &apos;s a building by craig ellwood there .
and when you have a hum like that , you can &apos;t help but strive for greatness .
and we as humans are social creatures and must , or are aided by , or enjoy more , the consumption of information in the presence of others .
and although today is about innovation without borders , i have to say that in my life , innovation has only been possible because of my borders .
and his mother told me this story of coming home one day — and he went to college nearby — and she said , &quot; &quot; i saw that car , which you can always recognize , in the parking lot of a bar , &quot; &quot; she said . ( laughter ) &quot; &quot; and i thought to myself , they &apos;re six feet tall , he &apos;s three feet tall .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future normally as experiences .
and we &apos;re in the process of sequencing all that at the present time .
you see , anything that uses a lot of energy is going to produce heat , and we don &apos;t observe this .
here are two very different walls , very different geometric pictures .
we make it really , really simple for me as well as anyone else who wants to use the site .
what if there were a pure form of justice ?
three : i failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude , not a lifestyle .
i &apos;m not suggesting that obesity is benign , but what i am suggesting is it may be the lesser of two metabolic evils .
it is growing all around us .
and so it &apos;s going to try to watch your response .
and bp was hardly our first experience of this in recent years .
they &apos;re killed ; we don &apos;t even hear about them .
and you &apos;ll be left in peace to talk to the person you really want to talk to .
here we are on october the 19th .
and once again , it &apos;s this invitation that asks people to lay down on the glacier and give it a hug .
done well , of course .
in the &apos; 60s already , through the green revolution and the haber-bosch process of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere — you know , human &apos;s today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole .
and here are two different images of the archimedes manuscript .
now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that gallup survey .
so i want to show you a clip of the film now .
the secret is , they have an eco-tourism program , which is absolutely brilliant .
and i understood that his surprise was my protection .
what i &apos;m not suggesting is that microbial cellulose is going to be a replacement for cotton , leather or other textile materials .
the world trade organization : treaty-based organization , entirely treaty-based , and yet , powerful enough to hold even the most powerful , the united states , to account if necessary .
so here you can see the left camera , the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the airpix .
and he took the thing and he looked up to steve and he said , &quot; look , hydrophobic string . &quot;
and for the future it won &apos;t serve us .
people consciously follow things even though , why , we don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t want to say in any way that it only has to do with what we do , but what i do know is that our work and the work that we do may have helped a lot of them start thinking about demobilization , and it may have helped a lot of them take the final decision .
we also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road .
i am an emotional , i am an emotional , incondotional , devotional creature .
but even more , i had a brother die in a tragic accident at 15 , and something as simple as this means we won &apos;t be together as a family .
this is just a fact of human nature that has been recognized in social science and in literature and in religion and in virtually every field of discipline .
if you don &apos;t like the 24 / 7 all kardashian all the time programming , you &apos;ve got to stop clicking on the stories about kim kardashian &apos;s sideboob .
so i said , &quot; &quot; i am dead , so i need to be born again . &quot; &quot; so , i wanted to be a painter like him , except , i don &apos;t know how to paint .
all right ?
but this is a problem of just incentives , just incentives .
the scientists i was with were not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff — the birds , the turtles , the dolphins , the glamorous stuff .
first one is really a question of origins .
this is the environmental conditions on the planet .
i &apos;m a visual artist , and i &apos;m also one of the co-founders of the plastic pollution coalition .
so when you see this march on washington in 1963 , when you look at that picture , where this is the march where martin luther king gave his famous &quot; &quot; i have a dream &quot; &quot; speech , 1963 , you don &apos;t just see a march and you don &apos;t just hear a powerful speech , you also see the painstaking , long-term work that can put on that march .
( laughter ) it &apos;s a pair of earmuffs and a set of safety goggles that have been masked over except for two small pinholes , because distraction is the competitive memorizer &apos;s greatest enemy .
( laughter ) let me take you back to the early 1960s .
malaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year .
and husbands can drag their wives across , if their wives don &apos;t feel ready .
and big companies like intel or smaller design firms like ideo or startups like bump , were inviting me to give workshops , just to practice this idea of smashing electronics and everyday objects together .
have you been to southern spain lately ? there are roads everywhere .
the first is the policy challenge of designing and implementing alternatives to ineffective prohibitionist policies , even as we need to get better at regulating and living with the drugs that are now legal .
when the environmentalists speak with economists , it &apos;s like a schizophrenic dialogue , completely incoherent .
and the last story i &apos;m going to talk about is quite a story .
mastery : the desire to get better and better at something that matters .
and the thing is , though , if you looked at my brain during those years in the moonies — neuroscience is expanding exponentially , as ray kurzweil said yesterday . science is expanding .
i also translate weather data into musical scores .
and you saw ty &apos;s little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the convolution program right before your eyes .
you &apos;ll all agree with me , i &apos;m sure .
design really looks upon the whole world and it considers the world in all of its different ranges .
heparin — a blood thinner , a pharmaceutical product — starts out in artisanal workshops like this in china , because the active ingredient comes from pigs &apos; intestines .
and this was true for all the pair-wise combinations of tasks .
so there &apos;s a list there of the different countries that have it , and then there &apos;s a few more coming on board .
and that &apos;s hard to do if you don &apos;t know who you are .
now , in regard to the current economic crisis , we think that we will just wake up again and everything will be the same as before , and no political or social changes are needed .
but we made it to pennsylvania .
but today i want to go a little bit deeper , and think about what the nature of this is .
after all , there are many other countries who face the same issues that we face .
we have to trust a lot of procedures .
thank you very much for your time .
are we still capable of that as a country ?
but for the first time in history , we have the technology ; we have the know-how ; we have the cash ; we have the life-saving drugs .
and lebanon ? struggling , of course , but it &apos;s managing .
and he &apos;s sitting there in front of the haptic device , the force feedback system , and he &apos;s moving his pen towards the heart , and the heart is now beating in front of him , so he can see how the heart is beating .
start from what they know . build on what they have . &quot; &quot; this was kind of the defining slogan .
so we &apos;ve created formulations for all around the world using regional byproducts .
now , our big symbol at ideo is actually not so much the place , it ’ s a thing .
and so it &apos;s quite surprising that many of us let our unconscious influence those decisions in ways that we are not quite aware of .
and therefore we know that women are not getting the full benefit of modern science and medicine today .
and she was also famous for walking up to a 15-foot rope , climbing it using only her arms , and then shuffling away and apologizing , because she knew she was supposed to use both her arms and her legs , as the rangers had trained them .
but when sarah jones asked me to please come to ted , i said , well , you know , first , i don &apos;t know that , you know — before two years ago , you would not find me in front of an audience of people , much less like this because i did not like to give speeches because i feel that , as an immigrant , i do not have good english skills for speaking .
now , i know some of you all are probably thinking , how did you find a great mentor in prison ?
and so , in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks , rather than somehow sensing the day outside .
keep learning .
( laughter ) we are right now seeing a much larger scale of tracking of individual citizens than he could have ever imagined .
you just know what it feels like to live in a closet .
that &apos;s true no matter what thing you &apos;re talking about .
they have it running through mazes , controlling where it &apos;s going .
once we define somebody as an enemy , we have trouble putting ourselves in their shoes , just naturally .
here &apos;s a map a lawyer made . he put on it the water plant , and which houses are there , which houses have been connected to the water .
let &apos;s start with iraq .
if we allowed refugees to do that , it would have major advantages .
he was born there in 1924 .
by 2030 , if the maize , or corn , varieties , which is the dominant crop — 50 percent of the nutrition in southern africa are still in the field — in 2030 , we &apos;ll have a 30 percent decrease in production of maize because of the climate change already in 2030 .
and so i &apos;m writing a new book .
but of course , you know , the reason you &apos;re laughing is bad for humans too .
we &apos;ve worked with a bunch of universities on a project looking at interactive newsprint .
we will install panels on your roof .
we &apos;ve driven from san francisco to los angeles on highway 1 .
you feel naked , exposed and vulnerable , but that vulnerability , that humility , it can be an extraordinary benefit to the practice of medicine .
let &apos;s multiply this sound by four-thirds . ( beep ) what happens ?
and the red line is the treatment as usual — medication with a medical doctor .
and we now have 350-pound auto workers learning bird songs on the internet .
you have half of an idea , somebody else has the other half , and if you &apos;re in the right environment , they turn into something larger than the sum of their parts .
( applause )
this was something we did with ibm that &apos;s a little bit more than a year old .
what it means is , when she sat in a restaurant in years to come , 10 years to come , 15 years to come , or she &apos;s on the beach , every so often she &apos;s going to start rubbing her skin , and out of there will come a piece of that shrapnel .
and this acoustical nuisance and visual nuisance basically exposed the discomfort of the work to this encompassing nature of the retrospective .
currently , the new narrative about braddock , a poster child for rust belt revitalization , is a story of urban pioneers discovering a new frontier .
so take a simple example , with r equals five percent and g equals one percent , wealth holders only need to reinvest one fifth of their capital income to ensure that their wealth rises as fast as the size of the economy .
but outside of that , i didn &apos;t really realize why it mattered that my parents were from two different places .
and since that time , this has been replicated 20 times .
obviously this is not a mandated duty , but for the gifted filmmaker and the responsible journalist or even blogger , it strikes me as being utterly inescapable .
and i &apos;ve always believed that the act of architecture , even a private house , when somebody else will see it , is a political act , because it will be visible to others .
the countries on the left have a form at the dmv that looks something like this .
because if we do , i can look forward to the conversation i &apos;m going to have with my daughter in 20 years .
and all of these things combine to create an enormous amount of torque on the planet .
we know that little skippy is loading his uzi down here , getting ready for homeroom . ( laughter ) we know that heather , his sister heather , 14 years old , is turning tricks up here to support her drug habit .
it doesn &apos;t look like much — in fact , it isn &apos;t like much .
and we said , &quot; &quot; well , there &apos;s another option .
and that changed , first with ships when we had the renaissance , the scientific revolution and also the industrial revolution .
when we have enough of them , we &apos;re going to have a nation that &apos;s not worth defending .
when your children and grandchildren sort of pose questions to you about this period of time , one of the things they &apos;re gonna ask you , is how it was they we allowed some of our closest living relatives , some of the most valuable and endangered species on our planet , to go extinct because we weren &apos;t able to address some of the issues of poverty in these parts of the world .
it &apos;ll be built into architecture .
and i &apos;m happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist .
but i also know that if you really understand me now , then your brain ... and your brain ... and your brain are really similar to mine .
what do any parent do ?
to do this , we &apos;ve had to make recordings of people laughing , and we &apos;ve had to do whatever it takes to make people laugh , and we got those same people to produce more posed , social laughter .
my father worked as a policeman in the city .
so in the end , he patted me on the shoulder like a swim coach might .
i was born in a scots presbyterian ghetto in canada , and dropped out of high school . i don &apos;t own a cell phone , and i paint on paper using gouache , which hasn &apos;t changed in 600 years .
( applause )
i have a hard time envisioning a future in which someone is saying , &quot; &quot; where , oh where , can i find a picture of a cute cat ? &quot; &quot; ushahidi , by contrast , is civic value .
part of that is true , there aren &apos;t as many prominent women in technology .
it doesn &apos;t catch every little thing that &apos;s going on .
this is a huge space that contains all words in such a way that the distance between any two of them is indicative of how closely related they are .
but according to a committee of academics convened by the national academy of sciences last year , the relationship between our historically high incarceration rates and our low crime rate is pretty shaky .
and then , once we start making those kinds of connections and asking those important and big questions , then we can talk about how we can be transformative , in other words , how can we do something differently ?
and no matter what country you live or work in , you &apos;ve also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of , even in their most ordinariness .
and it occurred to me that in this whole non-governmental world , somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets .
they actually see landscapes and human beings and gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that .
so what happened when the professor left the room ?
the yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars , creating carbon dioxide and alcohol — essentially it &apos;s burping and sweating , which is what bread is .
could i be misinterpreting the nature of my perceptions ?
and there was an unexpected speaker who wasn &apos;t on the program , and he talked about dna .
and we didn &apos;t study any of these animals .
in a 2015 survey of 70,000 employees , two-thirds of everyone who is paid at the market rate said that they felt they were underpaid .
so for instance , a biotechnology company has now found broadly neutralizing antibodies to influenza , as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus .
little , ring , middle , index . and then open .
fourth , feedback .
i don &apos;t want opinions ; i want knowledge .
these copepods are a major constituent of the oceans , and they are a major part of the diet of grazing baleen whales .
and what is significant about the program is that we learned a number of things .
tedtalks can &apos;t be a one-way process , one-to-many .
so in looking at that , i also realized that i was really angry .
it &apos;s a very simple behavior that shows you the power of this approach .
you add other forms of innovation and processor design , you get a doubling of price performance of computing every one year .
we don &apos;t know what causes them .
the question i would ask is , &quot; &quot; what &apos;s worth solving ? &quot; &quot; if you haven &apos;t seen this , it &apos;s pretty amazing .
to try this , i went to a mario batali restaurant in manhattan — del posto .
this is near the top of the icefall .
and guess what — they solved the problem .
and i believed i could do it .
and i was permanently hooked .
but out there , those lowest of the lows are so often contrasted with the highest of the highs .
it guides us how to feel .
i really got close to design again .
india has the right institutional conditions for economic growth , whereas china is still struggling with political reforms .
it &apos;s clearly undisturbed by us .
because think about the teddy bear .
i was as reckless and foolish as only young men can be .
punta espinosa is where i lived for over a year , and we call it uninhabited because there are no people there .
dancers at a street corner — it &apos;s a crowd , a small one , but they can all obviously see what each other can do .
and i said , &quot; &quot; what &apos;s the matter ? &quot; &quot; and she said , &quot; &quot; why can &apos;t i save e.t. ? why can &apos;t i come ? &quot; &quot; and then all of a sudden i realized : they weren &apos;t children ; they were boys — all boys .
and when you think about it , this makes a lot of sense , that using specialized physical objects would help people use an interface more easily .
( laughter ) eh : and the sitcom jewish mother is born , right there .
by now , you might have sort of lost perspective on how large this cube of brain tissue actually is .
case in point : i came up here and — ( clicking ) — they wouldn &apos;t tell me where the lectern was .
look , it &apos;s been a rough election year , a reminder that people with my immigration history could be removed at the whim of a leader .
i &apos;m an archeological geneticist at the center for evolutionary medicine at the university of zurich , and i study the origins and evolution of human health and disease by conducting genetic research on the skeletal and mummified remains of ancient humans .
the choices don &apos;t make sense , because it &apos;s the wrong question .
and there was no argument , because it &apos;s incentive .
just wait over there .
and everybody &apos;s dogs at home have an autobiographical self to a certain degree .
we introduced our first microcredit program in 1975 , and the women who organized it said , &quot; &quot; we only want to lend to women who practice family planning .
and this is how they see the world .
sometimes a single threat can polarize us , as we saw .
i think that can be changed by building combinatorial vaccines in advance .
that &apos;s my camera lens . the first one — the one i shot my bob dylan film with 35 years ago .
and we &apos;d do that by building fences , using motorbikes and horses , and the sheep would make their way all the way back to the shearing shed for the different seasons .
she lives in a little worker &apos;s camp right next to the road , and she wanted a different lot on things .
( laughter ) so , that &apos;s going to look pretty shabby now .
that &apos;s a huge number , and what does that mean ?
it tells you if you have h5n1 .
and i &apos;m going to talk about experiments that involve actually using this brain science , first of all to understand how it contributes to the loss of function as we age .
our heritage is much more than our collective memory — it &apos;s our collective treasure .
my american colleagues have told me i &apos;ve got to call it a router , so that everyone here understands — ( laughter ) — but nonetheless , here is the device .
i was the guy beaten up bloody every week in the boys &apos; room , until one teacher saved my life .
now , if we can learn those values from at least some influences on the right , if we can take them and incorporate them , maybe we could do a little trade .
there &apos;s an obvious objection .
we have several teams in the main part of afghanistan .
clearly , there are wrongs that need to be righted .
i left , and i became a social entrepreneur , and i set up an organization with mark shand called elephant family , which deals with asian elephant conservation .
now , our foundation , for the last nine years , has invested in this .
a message to the entertainment industry and to the press : on the whole , you &apos;ve done a wonderful job fighting stigma and prejudice of many kinds .
beliefs could be : where are my arms in space ?
boyd varty : well thanks , pat .
it was too late for me , but maybe i could help someone else , someone who could use the information .
but it turns out this is just a reminder that , although this is a lot of fun , when you interpret these graphs , you have to be very careful , and you have to adopt the base standards in the sciences .
they are happy . they don &apos;t have problems .
so it turns out that propulsion isn &apos;t really the problem .
( arabic ) omer by brother , i will always love you .
no way , that &apos;s impossible ! no no no no no ! that &apos;s not possible . &quot; &quot; till finally one prince said , &quot; princess , i accept , you have defeated me . &quot;
i wish they would just go away .
the first relates to the idea of civic education .
and if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing , your hands are bleeding in no time .
here &apos;s the girlfriend .
that compassion is actually an inherent human quality .
it &apos;s been estimated that two thirds of the melodies dylan used in his early songs were borrowed .
they have no trouble telling us what art is about .
in this century , scientists may learn to awaken the power of artificial intelligence .
when you ask that question , you think people must be happier in california if , say , you live in ohio .
and we must rebuild these forests .
but we can also store energy using superconductors , because we have no dissipation .
so , i propose the following — of course , the astronomer wouldn &apos;t like the idea — but let &apos;s turn the hubble telescope upside down .
and of course , in italy where — i mean , italians always seem to know where to find their pleasure — they &apos;ve launched an official slow sex movement .
these changes and others like them changed the way that portlanders live , and their vehicle-miles traveled per day , the amount that each person drives , actually peaked in 1996 , has been dropping ever since , and they now drive 20 percent less than the rest of the country .
this is actually from the klondike gold rush . this is the white pass trail .
so , steven is sharing this story , but he is not alone .
and it &apos;s a really poor area .
we then grow the cells outside the body , take the scaffold , coat the scaffold with the cells — the patient &apos;s own cells , two different cell types .
i learned this firsthand with my next adventure .
and none of those problems could i have dealt with , but i have a really bright research team .
today , we &apos;ve got great technology : we have gps .
&quot; &quot; my grandfather worked at this factory .
and that &apos;s the reason i beat him , actually , because i respected him .
you can have a succession of changes .
in this example , although the mammogram found one tumor , we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors — one is small as three millimeters .
it &apos;s not really what we do , is it , when we &apos;re at our best ?
( applause )
sandy was a reminder of how such an illusion can shatter .
if you chase a girl , the girl won &apos;t like you .
one day she said to me , &quot; &quot; my wish is to finish college and be able to support my children . &quot; &quot; she &apos;s at a place where she can &apos;t find money to go to school .
i just sat there and listened .
perhaps god is testing us : testing our charity , or our faith .
and this is all within our reach pretty easily .
they also get entangled in fishing gear .
did you know that paris has more mathematicians than any other city in the world ?
kb : thank you so much . ca : thank you , khalida . ( applause )
i want you to think about them as architectural objects , so what they are , are just pure lines .
we were fortunate , because in a way our building was future-proofed .
that was , of course , by le corbusier , the famous architect .
and another thing i would say is that girls &apos; voices and women &apos;s voices are beautiful , they are there , but we cannot do this alone .
we pioneered all sorts of new , flexible work methods : job shares , profit-sharing , and eventually , co-ownership when i took a quarter of the company into the hands of the staff at no cost to anyone but me .
he said , &quot; &quot; go on , milo . squash it . &quot; &quot; what we &apos;re using there is , we &apos;re using something , a piece of technology called tellme .
and was it even worthwhile to donate ?
we replaced these cars with trees , using which now we can make multi-layered forests .
but they do send a message to boys , that they are not , the boys are not really the target audience .
if i have a gps and a camera in my car , i have a pretty precise idea of where i am and how fast i &apos;m going .
my preconception of bilbao was this wonderful building , you go inside and there &apos;d be extraordinary spaces .
when they swarm and chase you down the block to shoot you , a little bit less so .
and so , up to 30 percent of our land and our space is used storing these hunks of steel .
it grows every year .
at night , i &apos;m in a submarine , i have force-feedback gloves , and i could delicately set up a lab in the front of my submarine , where the squishy robot fingers are delicately collecting and putting things in jars , and we can conduct our research .
so the word &quot; &quot; silhouette &quot; &quot; comes from a minister of finance , etienne de silhouette .
you rotate around the center of the circle , the circle remains unchanged .
nobody would have said 50 years ago that apartheid would have gone in 1990 , or that the berlin wall would have fallen at the turn of the &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s , or that polio could be eradicated , or perhaps 60 years ago , nobody would have said a man could gone to the moon .
instead , we believe you need to be inspired by biology .
i need to be in class because i need to graduate . &quot; &quot; so he knew that i was not going to let him be a victim of his circumstance , but we were going to push forward and keep moving on .
that gives you an idea of where they have people .
the next morning , two officers came to my home and reported that mike &apos;s car was down at the bridge .
it told us we were using twice as much energy as our neighbors . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) &quot; &quot; and for the last two weeks , all we can think about , talk about , and even argue about , is what we should be doing to save energy .
on a thursday morning in july 2005 , the bomber and i , unknowingly , boarded the same train carriage at the same time , standing , apparently , just feet apart .
put simply , in a room full of randomly selected people , i &apos;m a maths genius .
and so , we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all beings .
i was listed on the online biography that said i was a design missionary .
this is a map of stockholm , my hometown .
and from that comes the internet .
( laughter ) lp : i &apos;d just like to end off by just saying this : it took me four months again to feel my hands .
( laughter ) and yogi berra used to say , of course , that it &apos;s very tough to make predictions , especially about the future . ( laughter )
we all very matter of factly bought a pair of pants , put them on and said , &quot; &quot; thank you . that &apos;s exactly what i needed today , &quot; &quot; and then exited without revealing what had happened and went in all different directions .
similarly , infrastructure — for a long time , infrastructure was not a priority .
but you have to remember that these trees are literally bigger than whales , and what that means is that they &apos;re impossible to understand just by walking on the ground below them .
i know this , that &apos;s why love can be defined in a more accurate way as the desire of being desired .
we spotlighted many famous people such as lionel messi , the most famous soccer player in the world .
( laughter ) they were memorizing hundreds of random numbers , looking at them just once .
and it &apos;s known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus , they maybe lose the ability to recognize faces .
it &apos;s in six languages , and you can tell your own story about what happened to you on that day .
ok , that &apos;s practically everybody .
design done . ( laughter ) and they went for it ! ( laughter ) author liked it , publisher liked it , and that is how the book went out into the world , and it was really fun to see people reading this on the subway and walking around with it and what have you , and they all sort of looked like they were crazy . ( laughter )
we have no idea of what the supply chain is for those clinics .
and then i had a 15-hour surgery in which my surgeon , dr. john healey at memorial sloan-kettering hospital in new york , took out my left femur and replaced it with titanium .
so while this is a very small story , we hope that it represents a step in the right direction for the future of rural communities and for the future of public education and hopefully also for the future of design .
and with just a magnifying glass , he transcribed as much of the text as he could .
and ramos told wald , according to witnesses , &quot; i &apos;m not going to leave you . &quot;
he said what scientists do when a paradigm fails is , guess what — they carry on as if nothing had happened .
experts agree that it &apos;s impossible to farm cows for every inhabitant on this planet .
we observe facial expressions , body language , and we can intuit feelings and emotions from our dialogue with one another .
so she said , &quot; &quot; everybody in palestine , in where ? israel ?
they would just get frustrated with you .
most people long to overcome pettiness and become part of something larger .
i believe that , ultimately , we can overcome the digitally empowered networks of extremism , demagoguery and hate .
at work , we &apos;re so busy communicating that we often don &apos;t have time to think , we don &apos;t have time to talk , about the things that really matter .
there are some things that helped me , i think , be better than i would have been .
the main point of all this for me is , we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species .
they are 7,000 every year — people coming for the first time .
you can see this river being formed .
number 30 , i really like this one : tell your partner what you like about them ; be very honest this time , saying things you might not say to someone you just met .
you know , most people are terrified of snakes .
it &apos;s happening in kenya and tanzania , where millions of people who haven &apos;t had access to financial services now conduct all those services on their phones .
my colleagues will jones and alex teytelboym have explored ways in which that idea could be applied to refugees , to ask refugees to rank their preferred destinations , but also allow states to rank the types of refugees they want on skills criteria or language criteria and allow those to match .
this is called fuel partitioning in the lingo .
and the aspiration that we have at the moment — as young arabs are proving today and instantly rebranding themselves as being prepared to die for more than just terrorism — is that there is a chance that democratic culture can start in the region and spread across to the rest of the countries that are surrounding that .
you notice they make very few programs about gerbils .
we are living in an age of surging income inequality , particularly between those at the very top and everyone else .
how do i , as the narrator , as the writer , also influence that ?
in fact , it &apos;s as large as western europe , but it only has 300 miles of paved roads .
they &apos;re collaborative , they &apos;re branded , they &apos;re multinational , and they &apos;re highly disciplined .
and my kids in the south bronx were repped in the first international green roof conference .
six million pounds spent to reduce the journey time between paris and london by about 40 minutes .
if you get beyond one to six , you &apos;re not very comfortable anymore .
my pain , more than anything in 19 years on this planet , has given me perspective , and my hurt , my hurt has forced me to have hope , have hope and to have faith , faith in myself , faith in others , faith that it can get better , that we can change this , that we can speak up and speak out and fight back against ignorance , fight back against intolerance , and more than anything , learn to love ourselves , learn to accept ourselves for who we are , the people we are , not the people the world wants us to be .
when you step closer , you actually see that it is indeed all made up of numbers .
i think the dalai lama should have heard that . i wish he &apos;d been there to hear that .
they play lots of trials with different amounts each time .
in the summer of 2009 , my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer .

it &apos;s not going to happen , you know , in one year , but it &apos;s an important , deeply economic and cultural change that happens through children .
and poets , like other artists , play with those intuitive understandings .
pm : so how do we get this balance we &apos;re looking for , then , in the world ?
he set an ambitious goal : he wanted kenya to be ranked top 50 in this world bank ranking .
now , why do i say that ?
but now it &apos;s not falling , because there , with help from pepfar , it &apos;s working with treatment . and people are not dying .
and i &apos;m talking about the very end .
for the first time ever , african pain and african aspiration has the ability to be witnessed by those who can empathize with it the most : other africans .
more than 700,000 children in the united states aged 18 and under begin smoking every year .
this guy thought in the same way i did .
and particularly , how can it lead to the creation of buildings which consume less energy , create less pollution and are more socially responsible ?
it had gone through , like , five or six families , and it was just a big thing for us , and we found actually an old picture of somebody and their family years ago .
i came back home , told my mother , &quot; i &apos;d like to live and work in a village . &quot;
so to combat this , we tether ourselves with science .
that led us to think that maybe people with strong motivations and strong goals to exercise might actually see the finish line as closer than people who have weaker motivations .
any of those can be opened up .
somebody dance ! come on !
it &apos;d be lousy not to get a job one is qualified for , but it would triple suck if it was because of stack overflow in some subroutine .
so , the last thing we did , very quickly , is i took all those wish balloons — there were 117 interviews , 117 wishes — and i brought them up to a place called dochula , which is a mountain pass in bhutan , at 10,300 feet , one of the more sacred places in bhutan .
and i &apos;m also proud to announce that you &apos;re getting a sneak preview — on friday we &apos;re going to announce that we &apos;re actually forming a team to develop a system to grow plants on the moon , which is going to be pretty fun .
and then my teacher looks at me sort of concerned about halfway through the class and says , &quot; &quot; are you feeling ok ? &quot; &quot; i &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; are you kidding ? am i feeling ok ?
what i &apos;ve learned is that the most effective people and teams in any domain do something we can all emulate .
but as we enter , the ground drops below us and our perception shifts , where we realize that these columns evoke the lynchings , which happened in the public square .
you &apos;ve got the red-hat triathletes over there .
let me just give you an example from a recent study that we conducted . we asked participants to just simply give us their opinion of a variety of social groups , and we either made the room smell gross or not .
( laughter ) but of course , it &apos;s 2016 , so there &apos;s an app for that . ( laughter )
millions of in-the-ear hearing aids are already 3d printed today .
you know , she eats small portions .
i think we &apos;d all be pretty comfortable with this guy doing it .
but there has been a huge amount of progress .
so in a stage two culture — and we find these in all sorts of different places — you find them , in fact , in the best organizations in the world .
the first since this man , franklin delano roosevelt , who began his own unprecedented journey way back at his own first election , way back in a simpler time , way back in 1932 — ( laughter ) the year alberto giacometti ( laughter ) made &quot; &quot; the palace at four in the morning . &quot; &quot; the year , let &apos;s remember , that this voice , now departed , first came a-cryin &apos; into this big old crazy world of ours .
and he still is holding this line .
thank you very much .
so , i &apos;m pretty pleased with it all .
desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert , and this happens only when we create too much bare ground .
after the final &quot; &quot; no &quot; &quot; comes a &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; when any great moral challenge is ultimately resolved into a binary choice between what is right and what is wrong , the outcome is fore-ordained because of who we are as human beings .
wouldn &apos;t it be better , or more informative , or more useful , if instead we could look at the view like this .
and i really wanted to share with you a very special moment of my life and the history of the city of rio .
it may be the next rainforest , in terms of pharmaceuticals .
what do men have to do with gender equality ?
in fact , most of the rights that we have today in this country — as women , as minorities , as workers , as people of different sexual orientations and citizens concerned with the environment — these rights weren &apos;t handed to us .
is the destruction of the world inevitable ? should i have children ?
and if you remember that — raise your hands if you could .
&#91; a good conversation is like a miniskirt ; short enough to retain interest , but long enough to cover the subject . — my sister &#93; ( laughter ) ( applause ) all of this boils down to the same basic concept , and it is this one : be interested in other people .
these are really great things .
the rest of the world might casually encourage or even expect some sort of north korean spring , but i don &apos;t want you to do anything risky , because i know in your world , someone is always watching .
will this solve the problem ? will economics solve everything ?
but it &apos;s just not practical .
so those who are &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; raise your hand . &quot; &quot; for . &quot; &quot; okay , hands down .
the higher education system failed patrick , debbie and wael , exactly as it is failing millions of potential students , millions that graduate high school , millions that are qualified for higher education , millions that want to study yet cannot access for various reasons .
those fossil fuels have built our civilization .
and so , we wanted to find out might we be able to use hydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold , and we wanted to see whether we could reproduce this skier in a mammal .
and that changes everything .
because now it &apos;s become socially not acceptable not to show up to support your children at the manchester craftsmen &apos;s guild because people think you &apos;re bad parents .
this misinformation destroyed the credibility of the source , and it &apos;s harmed the credibility of other reliable and trustworthy sources .
one that i &apos;ll highlight here is changing the patient &apos;s name .
but today , the way i want you to understand a black hole , for the proof of a black hole , is to think of it as an object whose mass is confined to zero volume .
there &apos;s something else in that .
in 2003 , the whitney mounted a retrospective of our work that featured a lot of this work from the &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s .
but donna &apos;s biggest supporter came from an unexpected place .
now as you &apos;re reading , however , you will be maybe surprised that you will quickly become numb to the numbers of deaths , because you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers of faceless , nameless dead people .
and the reasons for their absence are given in my text panel .
it helps them suggest books for me to read or movies for my family to watch or friends for us to connect with .
how many of you use facebook photos , google photos , instagram ?
you work on the front lines . and you &apos;ve seen the best and the worst that human beings can do for one another and to one another .
so after dinner , the orchestra started to play , and the guests burst into song , and all of a sudden , taft was surprised with the presentation of a gift from a group of local supporters , and this was a stuffed opossum toy , all beady-eyed and bald-eared , and it was a new product they were putting forward to be the william taft presidency &apos;s answer to teddy roosevelt &apos;s teddy bear .
i &apos;m going to ask you to go ahead and put a blindfold on .
they had none of that .
and all i &apos;m going to try and prove to you with these slides is that i do just very straight stuff .
it &apos;s not telling the parents , &quot; &quot; if you see paralysis , take your child to the doctor or get your child vaccinated . &quot; &quot; we have a problem with marketing in the donor community .
was this a good idea ?
this is gen9 gene assembler , and so right now when you try to print a gene , what you do is somebody in a factory with pipettes puts the thing together by hand , you have one error per 100 base pairs , and it takes a long time and costs a lot of money .
and so while other kids were bbm-ing their parents , i was literally waiting by the mailbox to get a letter from home to see how the weekend had gone , which was a little frustrating when grandma was in the hospital , but i was just looking for some sort of scribble , some unkempt cursive from my mother .
if it has a subject , the subject is adolescence .
in my book i talked about the fact that 72 percent of people trust what other people say about a brand or a company , versus 15 percent on advertising .
let &apos;s start with the world of 1945 .
first of all , was that dance , even though it hadn &apos;t been offered to her , was her life .
here &apos;s the story i was telling : the gods up there , there were two people .
so it &apos;s the same way , like those action video games have a number of ingredients that are actually really powerful for brain plasticity , learning , attention , vision , etc . , and so we need and we &apos;re working on understanding what are those active ingredients so that we can really then leverage them to deliver better games , either for education or for rehabilitation of patients .
and i said , &quot; &quot; go read it . &quot; &quot; and they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; oh , that one wasn &apos;t so awesome . &quot; &quot; and then we went to another one — it didn &apos;t have great visuals , but it had great information — and spent an hour talking about the learning process , because it wasn &apos;t about whether or not it was perfect , or whether or not it was what i could create .
and then at my worst moments : why did i make such a stupid mistake ?
all the things that make a great city successful and all the things that make a great city stimulating — they were all on display there on those streets .
if i &apos;m going to teach my daughter about electronics , i &apos;m not going to give her a soldering iron .
( laughter ) ( applause ) and because it &apos;s so badass , those flags and crosses are found throughout amsterdam , just like chicago , they &apos;re used .
but race is a bad proxy .
so i would say , coquo ergo sum : i cook , therefore i am .
( applause )
but it actually turns out that your cells sit in this mesh of complicated fibers , proteins and sugars known as the extracellular matrix .
so , how do you do imitation ? why is imitation important ?
they don &apos;t have the frontal cortex .
so , in soap , fatty acids made from boiling pork bone fat are used as a hardening agent , but also for giving it a pearl-like effect .
and the good news is , nine years later , you can see improvements in quality and equity .
and in my case , as i was about five years old , this meant asking my mum .
finally , four great industrial sectors combined .
so what do you do when everything is out there ?
it &apos;s perfect for that particular context .
you know , they might have a solution .
so this is a sleeping baby , and under its nose , we &apos;ve put a clean glass rod .
( laughter ) powerful opponents are not going to give people what they want just because they asked nicely ...
dr : well the truth of the matter is , post-september 11th , i felt myself in the role originally — first of all as someone who lives in tribeca and whose neighborhood was devastated , and as someone who works less than a mile from there — that i was in the role of forcing 100 people who work with me in my firm , to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm about creating the places we had been creating .
those are the two choices we have . i know which future i would rather be living in .
here you have sub-saharan africa , south asia , east asia , arab states , east europe , latin america , and oecd .
( laughter ) and finally , it &apos;s okay for the speaker — that &apos;s the good news — to fake intellectual capacity .
and this is where we &apos;re actually going .
and when i would go back to swaziland , i would be constantly confronted by how very non-swazi i was becoming .
( laughter ) remember this ?
i &apos;m going to say almost not at all .
if we zoom in on this photograph right here , we can see it &apos;s a really nice photograph to have of her , because she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the same time to get a nice image of her facial texture .
and we can all make that choice .
instead , innovation , if you remember , some of you may have read the famous economist schumpeter , he said , &quot; &quot; innovation is novelty in how value is created and distributed . &quot; &quot; it could be new products and services , but it could also be new ways of producing products .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been working on the last couple of years , and that &apos;s what we need to be working on together — rethinking everything from the ground up , with a holistic view across the value chain , connecting all these things across the globe , alongside great entrepreneurs that are willing to share a collective vision .
and that it wasn &apos;t until 2009 , when president obama signed off on a surge , that we finally had , in the words of secretary clinton , &quot; the strategy , the leadership and the resources . &quot;
another answer might be , well , it came from a sort of lone genius working in his garage , who , working away on different kinds of bikes , comes up with a bike out of thin air .
but mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when i am one of the biggest beneficiaries .
there is so many things to do ; it &apos;s so fresh .
some of our kids started talking with their parents , others with their teachers , or with their friends .
and like a fool , i didn &apos;t go to the ceremony because i didn &apos;t think we were going to win .
because , after all , in that framework , between page one and 300 , you have to answer this question of why things happen , how things happen , in what order they happen . what are the influences ?
why ? i think there are three reasons , two long-term ones and the trigger .
luckily now things have changed because i came to discover the truth .
my friend red maxwell has spent the last 10 years fighting against juvenile diabetes .
but even with that , there still was another big hurdle , and that actually brings us back to the mapping of the human genome , because we &apos;re all different .
because physics doesn &apos;t give a damn about your gender .
so i too got one of those baby monitors so that i could see my daughter when she was asleep .
and so if language really is the solution to the crisis of visual theft , if language really is the conduit of our cooperation , the technology that our species derived to promote the free flow and exchange of ideas , in our modern world , we confront a question .
in the end , what really makes a government healthy is when healthy cells — that &apos;s you and i — get to the ground , roll up our sleeves , refuse to be helpless and believe that sometimes , all it takes is for us to create some space for healthy cells to grow and thrive .
it uses lots of pesticides , lots of fertilizer , lots of water .
i could relate to this homo erectus skeleton very well , because i was the same age that he was when he died .
this kind , intelligent young man from new jersey had just committed suicide .
and whenever we saw a flock of birds that had electronic communication , we thought , &apos; probably has something to do with the americans . &apos; &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; yeah .
this was really an extraordinary advance , because although these cells are not human embryonic stem cells , which still remain the gold standard , they are terrific to use for modeling disease and potentially for drug discovery .
when we face these crises , we have kept the potential , the huge potential of our society out of this process , and we are closing in on ourselves in politics , and i think we need to change that , to really find new participatory ways using the great capabilities that now exist even in technology but not only in technology , the minds that we have , and i think we can find solutions which are much better , but we have to be open .
for instance , you could find women who feel &quot; &quot; addicted &quot; &quot; in their 20s when it was cloudy in bangladesh .
the purple-painters and the green-painters fight over who &apos;s going to paint that bit behind the curtain ? no .
so even as we worry about it , we have allowed it to go on in this country — much different in europe — without any regulation , and even without any identification on the package .
we &apos;re all , under certain circumstances , willfully blind .
and they face a daily struggle with social stigma , with family despair , and with religious fire and brimstone .
there are too many people that think that high-technology medicine is going to keep them , save them , from overeating , from eating a lot of fast foods , from not getting any exercise .
it &apos;s getting more oxygen to your brain .
we insist on faith in the future and in each other .
how is technology changing love ?
this is another one from the woods .
imagine that was lake huron .
shouldn &apos;t you be doing something about this ? why haven &apos;t you had it removed ? &quot; &quot; and other children in curiosity come up and poke the lesion , because — a natural curiosity .
couldn &apos;t find a shred of evidence .
this is called hooked on a feeling : the pursuit of happiness and human design .
the icelandic prime minister had to resign .
but from about the age of five , i was aware that i didn &apos;t fit .
these are indicators that give you a much better read about the socioeconomic development of a country .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
whatever they could do , the earth &apos;s resilience would soon heal human activities .
the extreme might be in italy where , again , there &apos;s kind of some type of control over what &apos;s happening in the environment is very evident , even in the way that they sell and distribute periodicals .
i want to introduce you to an amazing woman .
and i asked her if she loved her baby .
can you possibly help ? &quot; &quot; let me describe haryana a little bit to you .
over the course of human history , starvation has been a much bigger problem than overeating .
before , i was an architect , and my grandmother asked me once , &quot; what are you doing for a living ? &quot;
you &apos;re looking at brine pools formed by salt diapirs .
just using a checklist requires you to embrace different values from the ones we &apos;ve had , like humility , discipline , teamwork .
i wasn &apos;t quite sure how to answer the question .
in america , we &apos;re all familiar with the term &quot; &quot; the american dream . &quot; &quot; i think it &apos;s time , across the world , that we &apos;re able to think also of something we might also call a dream for all humankind .
it &apos;s been there for three days , and it &apos;s laying on its back .
in fact , they raised more than 13,000 dollars to reward him for this discovery , raising a vital discussion in the technology industry about how we come up with incentives for hackers to do the right thing .
we make a practice of ignoring those limitations .
this is the netherlands , 2011 .
police took this blurry photo of me holding leaflets as evidence .
seventy percent — it &apos;s unbelievable .
if the breast is less than 25 percent dense , that &apos;s called fatty-replaced .
there must be hundreds of thousands of blind people who have these hallucinations , but are too scared to mention them .
and richard meier , who was one of my teachers , kept coming over to my desk to give me criticism , and he would say , &quot; &quot; bill , you &apos;ve got to understand- — solar energy has nothing to do with architecture . &quot; &quot; i guess he didn &apos;t read vitruvius .
you can find it on the east coast as well as the west coast , and often the symbols are very well preserved , so each of these symbols has four bits — it &apos;s a four-bit binary word — you draw these lines in the sand randomly , and then you count off , and if it &apos;s an odd number , you put down one stroke , and if it &apos;s an even number , you put down two strokes .
if our airplane is too heavy , if the pilot wastes energy , we &apos;ll never make it through the night .
( laughter ) if you do that , you might think , &quot; &quot; oh great . i &apos;m going to do my best work when i &apos;m in my 20s . &quot; &quot; but guess what , nobody will really care . ( laughter )
people died , including the crew of apollo 1 .
&quot; &quot; find it yourself , &quot; &quot; they said .
in fact , everybody in this room probably , especially if you picked up your bag — some of you , i know , didn &apos;t pick up your bags — but if you picked up your bag , everybody in this room has got in their pocket , or back in their room , something that 350 years ago , kings would have gone to war to have .
and this is a place where people not only reach age 100 , they do so with extraordinary vigor .
dh : now obviously , this is not something we do on our regular show ; it &apos;s something we just kind of learned for this , so we &apos;re going to try . but can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs ?
it reminded me a lot of the talk we heard this morning , about this operating room machinery that was designed specifically for africa .
so we &apos;re in the process of helping them design deep-well , low-cost manual pumps in order for these people who have a quarter acre of land to be able to grow crops in the off-season .
the best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you and try and — i want to get more on this that we could share along with the talk.as : wonderful .
so , that &apos;s an empty parka jacket .
and i could list more .
i was in a doctor &apos;s office last cat scan , and there was a reader &apos;s digest , october 2002 .
well , i actually don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to be the case .
but i really think this is a phenomenon that can inspire us .
they have come up with , in a sense , a different method for organizing activity .
the night before a match i &apos;m very nervous .
and because kuznets &apos; invention was found to be so useful , it spread around the world .
and just like the strings on a violin , they can vibrate in different patterns producing different musical notes .
and what we learned is cesar &apos;s work is far too good to explain in the new york times magazine .
this emerging economy really is helping the revival of the world economy .
and i think in life it should be exactly like this .
physicists and chemists have had nearly a century of trying to get used to this weirdness .
for me , this is about exploring human limits , about exploring the limits of physiology , of psychology and of technology . they &apos;re the things that excite me .
they don &apos;t usually get significant access to assistance .
you had to have quite a flair for the dramatic , and be really , really quick .
75 percent of people admit doing private conversations from work on their mobile phones .
thank you very much .
lighting in practice is placing lights inside this three-dimensional world .
which one of these guys am i actually related to ?
similarly , there &apos;s the work of people like marti guixe that tries to involve you in a way that is really about making everything pass through your mouth so that you learn from your mistakes or from your taste , orally .
so there was always going to be a tension within that .
mental note to the liberators : throwaway plastics take a lot of space and don &apos;t biodegrade .
rajiv suffers from a mental illness .
but i do think that being involved in the genesis of this really puts me and my colleagues in a position of responsibility .
but then , in the &apos; 90s , something began to unravel .
it &apos;s also hot , huge and unruly , made up of 17,000 islands , where people speak close to a thousand languages .
you probably haven &apos;t seen anything like this out there .
we have 31 brigades in the u.s.
i still love being close to someone reading to me .
and what &apos;s fantastic is that this symbol is not a thing , it &apos;s not an image , it &apos;s not an artifact , actually it &apos;s a space , and it &apos;s kind of just defined by a line of buildings on either side .
and yes , you also interact using natural gestures , both hands , etc .
we &apos;re using whatever leverage we have to bring them to the table .
we called people for help , and nobody came .
it &apos;s the indication that it &apos;s the best foie gras .
then another year goes by .
now , tonya also talked about working with a mentor , and this is really important to talk about , because if organizations , talent and performance systems aren &apos;t giving people in general information about the importance of business , strategic and financial acumen , how are men getting to the top ?
a friend of mine , an indian friend of mine , went to his grandfather when he was very young , a child , and said to him , &quot; i want to talk to you about religion , &quot; and his grandfather said , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re too young .
well here &apos;s how we &apos;re going to do it .
could you give me a flight ? because we &apos;re going to go see him . &quot; &quot; and of course , we went and saw him and it was amazing .
so , rather than have it fight or do industrial work , we decided to build a planter , put the robot into the center of it , and we called it the telegarden .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to leave you with this final thought .
in britain , 63 percent of all men who come out of short sentences from prison re-offend again within a year .
and these telescopes , among other things , they &apos;re being used to study how the expansion of the universe is changing with time .
chinese is always cheating , right ?
chimborazo !
the matter around the star is dragged around , and some energy from that rotation is transferred to that matter and the magnetic field is increased even further .
one in nine people in the world suffers from undernourishment .
and that &apos;s the sad part .
both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise , and both of them , because they &apos;re manufacturers , create jobs directly , and create incomes indirectly , because they &apos;re in the malaria sector , and africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year because of malaria .
dm : and now i &apos;ll attach the filter to the drums , so i can control the effect live . video : ( music )
so they &apos;ve managed to both restore the local ecology and the local economy at the same time .
and if you look at the light , it is illuminating as you would expect .
matt has also helped me to set up an organization that i &apos;m working with that has the name taken from the title of a book i wrote , &quot; the life you can save , &quot; which is trying to change our culture so that more people think that if we &apos;re going to live an ethical life , it &apos;s not enough just to follow the thou-shalt-nots and not cheat , steal , maim , kill , but that if we have enough , we have to share some of that with people who have so little .
our tissues all have very different abilities to regenerate , and here we see poor prometheus , who made a rather tricky career choice and was punished by the greek gods .
now the reason we did this is that humans are not very good at picking random words .
i sent nick off . nick came back .
it was kind of like being an astronaut , because we were getting to see things and go places that no one had ever seen or gone to before .
sanghamitra didn &apos;t start life as a leader of an ngo , she started her career as university professor , teaching english literature .
so we wanted to change the way that students approach technology , to create a more convivial and social space that was more engaging , more accessible , and also to increase the ability for teachers to use these spaces for technology-based instruction .
it &apos;s only 10 years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free-living organism , that of haemophilus influenzae .
she &apos;s in the studio with him for a long time .
( laughter ) but homage to singapore .
i was born in israel to a right-wing family , and as long as i remember myself , i wanted to join the israeli army to serve my country and prove what i believed was our right for the whole land .
our circumstances are different , but you &apos;re the same as us .
the end of the cold war and the disintegration of the soviet union .
this is fascinating . you probably know , some of you , that cells are continually renewed . you can see it in skin and this kind of stuff .
the more time i spent around these people and saw this problem , i thought , what if we could create a community , a place where people could feel like they belonged and that it was ok to do things differently , to take the road less traveled , where that was encouraged , and inspire people to change ?
i think we &apos;ve all read the grimms &apos; fairy tales , which are , indeed , very grim .
maybe we just follow our gut .
and second , it gives us the opportunity to understand how these supermassive black holes interact with their environment , and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution of the galaxies which they reside in .
my point is here , people have a choice — just like the indian lady could wear her sari or the japanese woman could wear her kimono .
they have the same share that we have .
mr : we used &quot; &quot; mary had a little lamb &quot; &quot; because those are said to be the first words that thomas edison spoke into his phonograph in 1877 .
if any — those of you who are older in the audience know that when i was a child we understood that a child born with a cleft palate was born with what we called mental retardation .
rl : so there are , when our legitimate foreign intelligence targets of the type that i described before , use the global telecommunications system as their communications methodology , and they do , because it &apos;s a great system , it &apos;s the most complex system ever devised by man , and it is a wonder , and lots of folks in the room there are responsible for the creation and enhancement of that , and it &apos;s just a wonderful thing .
so it turns out that being paid less and praised less has its upsides — for society at least .
in about four months of release , we &apos;ve brought that population of mosquitos — in most cases we &apos;re dealing with villages here of about 2,000 , 3,000 people , that sort of size , starting small — we &apos;ve taken that mosquito population down by about 85 percent in about four months .
( applause ) how about that ? how about we create a better world for nothing ?
and that &apos;s johnny depp &apos;s shoulder .
and with the right kind of help , maybe one day i could get better .
the existential and social and political impact an artist has on his nation &apos;s development of cultural identity is very important .
at the moment , they &apos;re incarcerated .
well , it &apos;s not . &quot; &quot; e.t. &quot; &quot; is about divorce . &quot; &quot; e.t. &quot; &quot; is about a heartbroken , divorce-crippled family , and ultimately , this kid who can &apos;t find his way .
that &apos;s an inconvenience compared to having both of them gone . &quot; &quot; i got a day job , and my nights and weekends are already filled up with things like , let &apos;s supply water to the world , and power to the world , and educate all the kids , which , chris , i will not talk about . i don &apos;t need another mission .
once it &apos;s perceived , and someone brings it into their own mind , then there &apos;s a cycle that has been completed .
one death every 20 seconds .
we &apos;re trying to make sure that clinicians , and therefore their systems that they work in have the ability , the confidence to address the problems in the living and working conditions in our lives .
so we &apos;ve started roundtables where we bring together the entire value chain , from producers all the way to the retailers and brands .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re all avid &quot; &quot; american idol &quot; &quot; watchers .
( laughter ) we &apos;ll loop around here in just a second , and you &apos;ll see another one .
do you think that your discussion may serve as a blueprint for other fields ?
it &apos;s got a fan , it &apos;s got headlights for warmth , it &apos;s got door chimes for alarm — it runs off a car battery .
one of the problems , when you get too much chatter , it &apos;s hard to process all the packets , so you have to prioritize , and that &apos;s where the predictive model helps you .
this was after the fall of gaddafi , but before libya turned into full-blown civil war .
the brief is that the bus should use 40 percent less energy .
orchids : there are 20,000 , at least , species of orchids — amazingly , amazingly diverse .
and so we could choose numbers of positions on the face to pull that data from .
so again , memory is the city , memory is the world .
but i want to concentrate on the role of investment in seeking out novelty , the production and consumption of novelty .
the river flows wider than a two-lane road along most of its path .
loose associations involves putting together words that may sound a lot alike but don &apos;t make sense , and if the words get jumbled up enough , it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; word salad . &quot; &quot; contrary to what many people think , schizophrenia is not the same as multiple personality disorder or split personality .
in most parts of the us , the baseline expectation in public is that we maintain a balance between civility and privacy .
now , i hope that mayors do one day rule the world , but , you know , the fact is , we don &apos;t hear any conversation , really , about what is happening in the south .
now , at some point i was in hawaii — i like to hike and surf and do all that weird stuff , and i was making a collage for my ma .
stop looking where you &apos;re going , turn , check your blind spot , and drive down the road without looking where you &apos;re going .
it &apos;s plastic pollution .
and i know you want to look and see if those spots are still there .
growing up , i had a nickname .
so being a mechanical engineer , being at mit and having lots of resources available to me , i thought i &apos;d try to do something about it .
let me tell you a story about a little girl named naghma .
on the last day , we met her majesty the queen of norway , and twitter couldn &apos;t quite handle it .
i &apos;m taking data from the u.n. — it &apos;s the same as the world bank has — on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies .
the logarithmic scale hides the scale of the increase , because this represents trillions-fold increase since the 1890 census .
one hint : it &apos;s not &quot; &quot; l. &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) it could be an &quot; &quot; l , &quot; &quot; of course .
this was incredible ; this is what i wanted to do .
that is , share your lunch .
so for example , in a power plant , when your big steam turbine gets too over speed , you must open relief valves within a millisecond .
it is too expensive for humanity .
remember in your car you have a gas tank .
and many of these muslims further say that their disagreement with the united states is that it , in the past and still in the present , has sided with autocratic rulers in the muslim world in order to promote america &apos;s short-term interests .
the whole world came running , and it was a bizarre experience , because everybody , from everywhere : &quot; &quot; who are they ? what are they ? how many are they ?
you &apos;re reading about this smart stuff , this intelligent dissection of the immune system .
today , we are beginning to understand how to interrupt the progression from early adversity to disease and early death , and 30 years from now , the child who has a high ace score and whose behavioral symptoms go unrecognized , whose asthma management is not connected , and who goes on to develop high blood pressure and early heart disease or cancer will be just as anomalous as a six-month mortality from hiv / aids .
and here we go !
and anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask and cover all of the extraneous parts of their body .
so what needs to be done ?
it is to make a super difference in the performance of others , with whom we are compared .
which side are you on ?
so he went to the church of nativity and brought back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen jesus being born .
a one million-person city per week with 10,000 dollars per family .
it says &quot; &quot; dreams &quot; &quot; at the top .
you know the incident .
this is the case . there are no other cases . &quot; &quot; and in that moment of desire and focus , he can win .
a single four-foot female had 300 million eggs , can carry 300 million eggs in her ovaries — imagine — and they get to be over 10 feet long . imagine what a 10 foot one has .
and the saying goes , we came from dust and will return to dust .
yes , it is . it &apos;s our work — that was a while ago , and it still is my favorite project — of teleconferencing .
and if you turn the lights on , you might periodically see spectacular organisms swim by , because those are the denizens of the deep , the things that live in the deep ocean .
it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; among the school children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o body swayed to music / o brightening glance / how &#91; can we know &#93; the dancer from the dance ? &quot; &quot; and here is merce cunningham , i was fortunate to dance with him when i was younger , and here he is a dancer , and while he is dancing , he is both the dancer and the dance .
and so , you know , for example , with these devices , patients can see simple things like bright lights and high contrast edges , not very much more , so nothing close to normal vision has been possible .
so it &apos;s these two totally different perceptions of my personality .
in other words , everything you need to do in order to remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed by mid-adolescence , whereas in contrast , if you look at the last two gray bars , there &apos;s still a significant improvement in the director condition between mid-adolescence and adulthood , and what this means is that the ability to take into account someone else &apos;s perspective in order to guide ongoing behavior , which is something , by the way , that we do in everyday life all the time , is still developing in mid-to-late adolescence .
this ain &apos;t going to be my last movie .
we are talking here about , oftentimes , very young individuals with spinal cord injuries , that in the prime of their life — 20s , 30s , 40s — hit a wall and the wheelchair &apos;s the only option .
what i will focus on in my talk is why they matter , how they matter , and what we can all do to make sure that they continue to matter in the right ways , that is , how all of us can contribute to developing and honing the skills of local and global leaders to make peace and to make it last .
and i am going to be their help along the way .
in ringing babylonian — it was written in babylonian — he says , &quot; &quot; i am cyrus , king of all the universe , the great king , the powerful king , king of babylon , king of the four quarters of the world . &quot; &quot; they &apos;re not shy of hyperbole as you can see .
i remember having to use vodka — my own vodka — to pickle it because we don &apos;t carry formaldehyde .
and because of this action , that contract was vacated , and now this has sparked a movement in mexico city which is home to one of our partners , code for mexico city .
now , what about what else is going on out there in the universe ?
forget the &apos; 60s . we can change the world .
and then people came .
this year &apos;s h1n1 threat was actually a human , avian , swine mixture that arose in mexico .
even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford .
that &apos;s a lot of pressure . &quot; &quot; i just wanted a blessing , i didn &apos;t want some kind of mandate .
it is with this context that ushahidi came to be .
but i will continue to consider this idea , and i will report back maybe next year .
we treat biotechnology with the same scrutiny we apply to nuclear power plants .
at the same time the city had this need .
between them , these new revenue flows dwarf aid .
then there &apos;s the r-word , proving that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to far too many people .
just two things .
i think it really is transparency and secrecy .
it &apos;s an algorithm that actually allows you to browse the actual museum &apos;s collection using facial recognition .
and i think what it is is i don &apos;t think we have fully come to terms with the meaning of this disaster , with what it meant to witness a hole ripped in our world , with what it meant to watch the contents of the earth gush forth on live tv , 24 hours a day , for months .
we have a video to show you .
( laughter ) td : but it didn &apos;t turn out to be so fun and entertaining , as i thought it would have been .
with our strengths and our minds and spirit , we gather , we form , and we fashion .
and that is the migraine invention that we are talking about and that we are working on .
you need to look at all of the different transportation routes as well .
for nearly a decade afterwards , risen was the subject of a us government investigation in which prosecutors demanded that he testify against one of his alleged sources .
so let me show you how the system works .
there &apos;s a wonderful book called &quot; &quot; crowns &quot; &quot; that &apos;s all these glamour pictures of black women in their church hats .
and they were holding it in their laps .
and making sense of the financial crisis is very , very difficult .
it sort of ended abruptly when she was executed — ( laughter ) — for murdering 600 men . you see , it wasn &apos;t a very good perfume .
whether it &apos;s like the shark in &quot; &quot; jaws &quot; &quot; — if spielberg &apos;s mechanical shark , bruce , had worked , it would not be remotely as scary ; you would have seen it too much .
ten years ago , however , the promise of democracy seemed to be extraordinary . george w. bush stood up in his state of the union address in 2003 and said that democracy was the force that would beat most of the ills of the world . he said , because democratic governments respect their own people and respect their neighbors , freedom will bring peace .
all other species on this planet are gene machines only , they don &apos;t imitate at all well , hardly at all .
and i said , first of all , let me do the calculation on that compound , bottom right , which is related to coumarin , but has an extra pentagon inserted into the molecule .
is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
but it can &apos;t be the fault of somebody like this .
they used to use cardboard boxes years ago and we still use them .
we could rerun that play a lot better now .
i need to rest . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) iranians , sometimes we do two , sometimes we do three .
in kyrgyzstan , just over the last few weeks , unprecedented levels of violence occurred between ethnic kyrgyz and ethnic uzbeks .
but it is just physiology . it &apos;s just in your brain .
however , only recently , due to several technological advancements , we are now able to demonstrate to you quantum levitation and quantum locking .
and it works the exact same way .
this shows the artistic impulses inside us are suppressed , not gone .
so , we have to work out who influences problems .
it &apos;s an extraordinary place .
that punch card system inspired victorian inventor charles babbage to create his analytical engine , the first true programmable computer ever designed .
globalization has been taken to support a neoliberal agenda .
so i look at that question from a bit of a different lens , and i want to know , how can we prevent concussion ?
and people are okay with it .
and so , i want to kind of go through my little story of what i found out .
the one that this step is enabling us to do is coming next .
and this is the same thing you see when people compress video to send : they want to make it very sparse , because that file is smaller . and this is what the retina is doing , and it &apos;s doing it just with the circuitry , and how this network of neurons that are interacting in there , which we &apos;ve captured on the chip .
what is this about ?
but dragonflies — a bit tricky .
over the spanish steps we go .
i find this a particularly apt description of science and how science works — bumbling around in a dark room , bumping into things , trying to figure out what shape this might be , what that might be , there are reports of a cat somewhere around , they may not be reliable , they may be , and so forth and so on .
coke &apos;s been in africa since 1928 , but most of the time they couldn &apos;t reach the distant markets , because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world , which was a large truck rolling down the street .
there &apos;s no breeding pairs left .
so what we found is that the bursts last long enough in order to support wave resonances , which are things caused by exchanges of energy between particles that may have been excited , that depend on the volume .
every time we lead one of these efforts we have to whip ourselves into this imminent threat thing .
and the women decided that they would train not the next generation of girls , because they had grown too old already , but the next generation .
so i get a basic idea as to what you might be about , what you might like , what you might do as a profession , etc . , etc .
you can &apos;t — okay .
and you know , lego — don &apos;t take legos to lego .
did you know the world games happened this year ?
more protein than a hunter &apos;s family could eat before it rotted .
it &apos;s a seductive place , isn &apos;t it ?
he goes down to the basement and starts to check the wiring , and then gradually works his way up to the top of the building , apartment by apartment , checking every television , checking every connection , hoping to find out what this problem is .
what &apos;s happened here , again , almost without our knowing , is our culture has changed .
for any new requirement , you have a dedicated function in charge of aligning engineers against the new requirement .
and this makes us interested in real brains and neuroscience as well , and especially interested in the things that our brains do that are still far superior to the performance of computers .
he said , &quot; &quot; there are only two things that matter in music : what and how .
they &apos;re just information , why would they ?
but if i show you this picture it &apos;s not to tell you how happy we were .
but kiribati is comprised of three groups of islands : the gilbert group on the west , we have the phoenix islands in the middle , and the line islands in the east .
and so we needed grants . and he used significant grants to research , to experiment , to fail , to innovate and try again .
for example , it is counterintuitive to have an illiterate study participant , like celine , sign a lengthy consent form that they are unable to read , let alone understand .
now , as it happens , warren buffett is not only himself a plutocrat , he is one of the most astute observers of that phenomenon , and he has his own favorite number .
well , you are to ride a bicycle , carrying your own weight and also some other weight , so that you can earn the bread for the day .
it extends from the subatomic scale to the farthest reaches of the cosmos .
i was 13 months when they removed my left eye .
the other volunteer who had arrived just before me — let &apos;s call him lex luther — ( laughter ) got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner &apos;s dog .
better said , what the angular resolution is of the things that you see .
&quot; &quot; i don &apos;t need your help , &quot; &quot; he said .
there wasn &apos;t ddt , there wasn &apos;t chloroquines : what do they do ?
the world is changed by our maps of the world .
they &apos;re all coming in at this time , walking across there , just kind of leisurely coming in .
i have and i offer a gospel of doubt .
so &quot; &quot; justin . &quot; &quot; is that the name of the user , their boyfriend , their son ?
they &apos;re driven by this duty and this obligation .
&#91; shit &#93; this is arguably the back end of the design of animals .
so what should we do now ?
and i thought the secret of the site was to make the building of the river , part of the river .
and companies that actually define a true north , things that are nonnegotiable whether times are good , bad , ugly — doesn &apos;t matter .
the stock market has been on a roll , going up as everybody knows , and price-earnings ratios have grown .
he said he &apos;d lived his whole life there by the beach , and that he would rather die there than run .
so if you want to save a village , you do it with a good road , or with a good cell phone connection , and ideally some grid electrical power .
we look around the media , as we see on the news from iraq , afghanistan , sierra leone , and the conflict seems incomprehensible to us .
( laughter ) so even with that caveat , i knew that someone would buy the naming rights .
okay . three stories . here &apos;s the argument .
another new vocabulary word for the brave new world : this is the word &quot; &quot; flupsy &quot; &quot; — it &apos;s short for &quot; &quot; floating upwelling system . &quot; &quot; and this glorious , readily available device is basically a floating raft with an oyster nursery below .
if you &apos;re in india , it &apos;s either muslims or adivasis , our tribals , the naxalites .
these early wasps gave rise to the bees and the ants that have covered the world and changed the biosphere .
now , more europe for me is not simply giving more power to brussels .
when i stood up to speak to my people about god and the tsunami , i had no answers to offer them .
i mean , it &apos;s a hobby of mine that i &apos;ve been indulging in for the last few years , and it all started out with this picture of the american artist , donald baechler i had hanging at home . i had to look at it every day and after a while i just couldn &apos;t stand the mess anymore this guy was looking at all day long .
and he points it at me and gives the moon a break .
the next video is not done by us .
marine organisms do not care about international boundaries ; they move where they will .
all that pink chalky candy has moved to the front of the building and is now being picked into a lot of orders in those pick stations .
so i didn &apos;t have to do any of the cocontracting and all that .
so , looking for answers , i went to catholic mass .
okay . so i &apos;m smiling .
and it has this constant voiceover narrative in your stream of conscious thinking .
remember that we scanned both brains at the same time , so we can ask about time-synced activity in similar or different areas simultaneously , just like if you wanted to study a conversation and you were scanning two people talking to each other and you &apos;d expect common activity in language regions when they &apos;re actually kind of listening and communicating .
( applause )
and that would be very interesting in the developing world .
we c.t.-scanned all of our bones and built a digital spinosaurus skeleton .
we need — when procurement , supply chain , manufacturing don &apos;t cooperate we need more stock , more inventories , more working capital .
because the killer apps can be downloaded .
what makes us human is that , of all these things that our minds and their minds have , we are the most extreme .
and doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients , but now this will change .
is there a way we can show people food in a way they have not seen it before ?
every storm is different now . &quot; &quot; so , the same extra heat pulls the soil moisture out of the ground and causes these deeper , longer , more pervasive droughts and many of them are underway right now .
( applause )
that &apos;s the twelfth one .
and this is continuing and continuing and continuing .
and four , a global recession that has fundamentally shocked consumer behaviors .
if we do not lift up the women who played critical roles in these struggles , we fail to offer up role models to future generations .
and that &apos;s a new kind of leadership for me .
between 1966 and 1990 , the u.s. and soviet interests fought for control over my country .
one percent check the box . the rest do nothing .
and finally , finally , they &apos;ve managed to put instant messaging on their computers at work .
but right now we don &apos;t have enough of that .
what now fits in our pockets would fit in a blood cell in 25 years .
young people living in kibera in their community , with simple handheld devices , gps handheld devices and sms-enabled mobile phones , have literally put themselves on the map .
mars is not our sister planet .
as i found , if you really want to know a people , you start by looking inside their bedrooms .
if you learn to code , you can code to learn .
&quot; a smile is a door that is half open and half closed , &quot; the author jennifer egan wrote .
but there &apos;s an important thing to remember here : even though companies pushed back , even though companies demanded , hey , let &apos;s do this through a warrant process , let &apos;s do this where we actually have some sort of legal review , some sort of basis for handing over these users &apos; data , we saw stories in the washington post last year that weren &apos;t as well reported as the prism story that said the nsa broke in to the data center communications between google to itself and yahoo to itself .
( laughter ) but actually , the most impressive thing to me is that — well , actually , i would also like to say this for all children is to say thank you to all adults , for actually caring for us a lot , and to make our future world much better .
so , where do we go from here ?
so one has got to discover a certain wholeness .
now , the final piece of this , the take-home message from a working memory capacity standpoint is this : what we process , we learn .
he missed .
we had a global bubble .
so you can think about how unstable that would be .
dean koontz built this fabulous home theater , which is — i don &apos;t think accidentally — in art deco style .
an extremely important part of this project was about how i photograph these extraordinary people .
the term &quot; &quot; manipulative , &quot; &quot; often charged against women in a derogatory way , reflects a reality in which women have often had to find ways other than direct confrontation to achieve their goals .
and who &apos;s to say that they &apos;re wrong ?
you sit there , ok .
and i think it &apos;s no accident that we think this way .
( laughter ) fg : you &apos;ve all heard the frank lloyd wright story , when the woman called and said , &quot; &quot; mr. wright , i &apos;m sitting on the couch and the water &apos;s pouring in on my head . &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; madam , move your chair . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so , some years later i was doing a building , a little house on the beach for norton simon , and his secretary , who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady , called me and said , &quot; &quot; mr. simon &apos;s sitting at his desk and the water &apos;s coming in on his head . &quot; &quot; and i told her the frank lloyd wright story .
and torture &apos;s a terrible enough thing as it is , but when it &apos;s done by your hero , that just breaks you in so many ways .
they fought for their rights for over two centuries , and maybe because they sacrifice other minorities , hispanic , asian , we would suffer more in the mainstream .
its origins are located in russia .
&quot; parting thought : when there &apos;s bigger and better errors , we &apos;ll have them . &quot;
and we &apos;ve already started construction on section two .
but dragonflies are not the only creatures that make the crossing .
well , from there , unfortunately , in 2004 , the project came to a halt . many political reasons .
now if you put these ideas together , the third idea is that we essentially give these robots mathematical descriptions of the shape they need to execute .
and this is a hundred-year-old toy .
you see the tragedy in south africa there .
jogging , which is commonplace , and widely accepted as good for you , is solemn .
and your eye doesn &apos;t know which level to read .
and let me just summarize . so the bottom line : the brain processes information using 100,000 times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have .
but they were not teaching .
we &apos;re collecting and creating all kinds of data about how we &apos;re living our lives , and it &apos;s enabling us to tell some amazing stories .
( laughter ) and people scream .
it helps to have good friends .
next , consider making your business carbon-neutral .
but if another language can think that thought , then , by cooperating , we can achieve and learn so much more .
and i got to tell you , i think that was a huge error .
and when someone wants to rent a room , they go onto the blockchain database and all the criteria , they sift through , it helps them find the right room , and then the blockchain helps with the contracting , it identifies the party , it handles the payments just through digital payments — they &apos;re built into the system .
and so people jumped on board , and not just in los angeles but across the country .
of course there are mysteries , but a mystery is a mystery .
and they are our responsibility .
i think in absolute terms , last year we earned about 20-odd million dollars , spent about 13 million , with over a 40 percent ebita .
and i &apos;m a very nerdy doctor , so i read all of the studies that i could on this drug . i read the one study that was published that showed that reboxetine was better than placebo , and i read the other three studies that were published that showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other antidepressant , and because this patient hadn &apos;t done well on those other antidepressants , i thought , well , reboxetine is just as good . it &apos;s one to try .
why is it a disease of the aged ?
let &apos;s look at a couple of quick examples .
but how is it that we can start to think about using choreographic thinking , kinesthetic intelligence , to arm the ways in which we think about things more generally ?
i can &apos;t go through all of them , but i &apos;ll give you an example .
mg : yeah , i &apos;ve had a lot of women say to me , &quot; &quot; i really don &apos;t think i could work with my husband .
the first thing , i got out of jail , of course after i took a shower , i went online , i opened my twitter account and my facebook page , and i &apos;ve been always very respectful to those people who are opining to me .
and if our sun has planets — mercury , venus , earth , mars , etc . , surely those other stars should have planets also , and they do .
i figure about half of that are men , so that takes the number down to 750,000 .
but we do provide on that website a standardized list of definitions , because it &apos;s hard to attack a behavior in the right way if we &apos;re not all sharing a definition of what that behavior is .
&quot; that &apos;s right , &quot; it said , &quot; i am youtube . &quot;
and the marrow miner , the way it works is shown here .
he &apos;s still waiting for his funeral in norway , and none of his family will be able to attend .
one of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet .
so get peacekeepers there , but get them home as soon as possible .
and the collective has enabled me to form collaborations with a whole array of interesting people .
so i made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life , and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse — the subject of martyrdom , the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection of love of god , faith , but violence and crime and cruelty .
impressive . thank you .
( applause )
pew research polls chinese public attitudes , and here are the numbers in recent years .
and my intention was to go out to the gyre , raise awareness about this issue and begin to pick up the plastic , chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks that could potentially be used as building materials in underdeveloped communities .
and a small group of thoughtful people changed that bay .
we are going to need a new generation of citizen leaders willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning as rapidly as possible .
now we &apos;re talking scale .
my mother &apos;s mother left europe in a hurry without her husband , but with her three-year-old daughter and diamonds sewn into the hem of her skirt .
and in fact , there &apos;s a thriving market in the partially eaten food of beloved people .
this is a new device that is essentially doing that .
if we can install these molecules in neurons somehow , then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light .
that &apos;s my simple proposition to you , my simple plea to every decision-maker in this room , everybody out there .
we asked ourselves simply : can design help rebuild trust ?
and it just disturbed me so much .
you see these cars that drive up — usually it &apos;s saabs and audis and volvos , because in certain neighborhoods it &apos;s socially acceptable to have a luxury car , so long as it comes from a country hostile to u.s. foreign policy — that &apos;s fine .
so i started thinking about peace , and i was obviously , as i said to you , very much moved by these images , trying to make sense of that .
and i feel that we have a special connection , which i value very much .
they seem cleverer .
i spent ages flying this flight simulator , and i honestly believed i could fly airplanes by the end of it .
because gps doesn &apos;t work under water . that &apos;s why we need these tools .
and the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on .
and what we can do with our biology is going to shape our future and that of our children and that of their children — whether we gain control over aging , whether we learn to protect ourselves from alzheimer &apos;s , and heart disease , and cancer .
it &apos;s basically a little health care screening tool that we developed .
ataturk was a lateral thinker .
through his eyes , we knew when he needed to hear again , &quot; &quot; it is all set , jim . we &apos;re going to take care of shirley right here at the ranch , and acr &apos;s going to take care of your wildlife forever . &quot; &quot; from this experience i &apos;m going to share five practices .
my mother and father had been saving money for years to be able to buy that machine , and the first day it was going to be used , even grandma was invited to see the machine .
in fact , it &apos;s continued to increase .
my name is ani , and i &apos;m a designer and researcher at mit media lab , where i &apos;m part of a relatively new and unique group called design fiction , where we &apos;re wedged somewhere between science fiction and science fact .
but growing up as a child with the books around everywhere , with people to talk to about those books , this wasn &apos;t a sort of slightly learned thing .
they were living on top of the workshops where they were working .
and to get there , we have to change our workplaces , our policies and our culture .
this is not sustainable .
now the other thing is , we don &apos;t really know that much about how to make a particular thing happen by changing particular spots in the genome .
example number two : wikipedia .
what is love ?
now , of course , just like life , soap operas do ultimately meet the big finale .
what we noticed is when the bacteria were alone , so when they were in dilute suspension , they made no light .
but they can often reveal themselves negatively , in the form of jealousy .
history is not linear .
show the kids what bad customers or bad employees look like .
and we wanted to try and encourage people to use energy better .
then it deserves protection .
around here , no ? the redwood forests are gone .
so here we are in one part of the world — a time of joy , excitement , dreaming of the future of that child — while in another world , parents are filled with dread , not daring to dream of a future for their child beyond a few precious weeks .
so there are many other details like this .
equally startling , from my point of view , is the fact that no one was drawing any connections between what is happening to the body politic , and what is happening in our leading educational institutions .
they choose very carefully who they connect with .
it also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm , or their farm to a town , or from a town to a city .
so , i thought , could we have darius serve as our babycam carrier , and that way get the inputs that we feed into dylan ?
i was in congo in february , dancing and celebrating with women who &apos;ve survived the destruction of their selves in literally unthinkable ways — destroyed because other brutalized , psychopathic selves all over that beautiful land are fueling our selves &apos; addiction to ipods , pads , and bling , which further disconnect ourselves from ever feeling their pain , their suffering , their death .
because food is one issue that cannot be solved person by person , nation by nation .
well , when we look out , you and i , over that canopy of the intact primary forest , what we see is this enormous carpet of carbon .
she pointed out that the &quot; &quot; control men &quot; &quot; — as she called them — who carpet-bombed towns and fields with toxic insecticides like ddt , were only trying to kill the little stuff , the insects , not the birds .
i think these are so commonplace , they &apos;ve become clichés of our society .
with gravitational waves , we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning .
you have to trust me . take it on faith . &quot; &quot; well , i &apos;m sorry , people , but we are back to the pre-enlightenment church , and we need to fight against that .
this is based on the number of hosts .
and you can &apos;t tell the story about pollinators — bees , bats , hummingbirds , butterflies — without telling the story about the invention of flowers and how they co-evolved over 50 million years .
now we don &apos;t know if it says hollywood , or even bollywood for that matter .
and i also want to share this one .
solidifying into surface , molded by fire .
the doctor , medical team from university of miami arrived at five in the morning .
do you want to view the pandemic threat the way back in the 1950s people viewed the civil defense issue , and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu ?
they are sold in the name of forced labor , camel jockeying , anything , everything .
now , what you can see here is essentially a sugar molecule that was added a small little tag that is signaling to us outside of the body , &quot; hey , i &apos;m here . &quot;
( applause ) in 1949 we saw the emergence of the modern china in a way which surprised the world .
but we call each reading an emotion data point , and then they can fire together to portray different emotions .
how about underground with a view ?
were we to be able to identify this condition at an earlier point , and intervene and treat — i can tell you , this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past 10 years , this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition .
one brooklyn paper called this bike lane that we have on prospect park west &quot; &quot; the most contested piece of land outside of the gaza strip . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and this is what we had done .
ten years ago , when i was on an airplane and i introduced myself to my seatmate , and told them what i did , they &apos;d move away from me , because , quite rightly , they were saying psychology is about finding what &apos;s wrong with you .
and you know , i saw all the visions of the first couple of sessions .
but so too can our mind .
it &apos;s really difficult .
now this is a little bit of a dangerous metaphor , because of course we all know that inside of the trojan horse were a bunch of people with spears .
so we find this penny kind of fossilized in the floor , and we think that a very wealthy man must have left it there because regular people don &apos;t just lose money .
it &apos;s really just a pressure sensor like the kind that &apos;s in a doorbell .
and i suddenly thought , most deaf children are born to hearing parents .
so in the volume of the ocean , we will know , not just the physics and the chemistry , but the base of the food chain will be transparent to us with data on a continuous basis .
and even if they sometimes do nothing at all .
what was common to us all 40 years ago — the telling of stories between generations — is now rarified .
it &apos;s a very , very simple example , an easily stated question in probability , which every — you &apos;re in good company — everybody gets wrong .
( laughter ) and that was the 1950s .
it &apos;s the outstanding collaborators who enjoy the long careers , because bringing out the best in others is how they found the best in themselves . &quot; &quot; and when i went to visit companies that are renowned for their ingenuity and creativity , i couldn &apos;t even see any superstars , because everybody there really mattered .
frequently , a strategy has to be rethought .
and finally , well , there are those who believe that corruption is unavoidable .
at that moment , they fired and shot off my fingers .
i feel ashamed .
as i witnessed my father &apos;s body being swallowed by fire , i sat by his funeral pyre and wrote .
see , that skylight goes down and becomes that one .
so , for example , stones .
because the thing about being autistic is , i had to learn social skills like being in a play .
wonder is honest , it &apos;s completely innocent .
let &apos;s focus on the conversations between our friends and our family and our coworkers and our loved ones .
he goes , &quot; &quot; hey , mister ! mister ! &quot; &quot; and i looked at him — he didn &apos;t know any other english than that , but we didn &apos;t need english , no , no , no , no , no .
one day you &apos;re living your ordinary life , you &apos;re planning to go to a party , you &apos;re taking your children to school , you &apos;re making a dentist appointment .
i work in some of the most extreme cave environments on the planet .
so if i understood the chemistry of trustworthiness , i might help alleviate poverty .
metaphor is not just the detection of patterns ; it is the creation of patterns .
if they &apos;re new books and you can just , you know , butcher them , because you could just buy another one , that &apos;s not such a big deal in terms of doing high-quality scanning .
we started looking for funding , but instead , we just ran into questions , like , how many houses are you going to paint ?
so to me , there are no sudanese problems or south african problems or kenyan problems , only african problems because eventually , we share the turmoil .
such understated power here , in these tottering dancers who exert stupendous effort on tasks most view as insignificant .
he painted the walls and he painted the machine , and he got the operators retrained by people who know kids , like children &apos;s museum people .
so i finished , and it was a success in a sense .
and the people who were highly trusted 20 years ago are still rather highly trusted : judges , nurses .
too often , we receive information from journalists but we forget how that information was given .
i mean , i can use profane words like &quot; &quot; shit &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; piss , &quot; &quot; and then my grandma won &apos;t watch the video .
and it &apos;s a sort of a working computer . and when i built this computer , i had a moment of — what is it called ? — the epiphany where i realized that the computer &apos;s just so fast .
this is a drug called tamiflu . tamiflu is a drug which governments around the world have spent billions and billions of dollars on stockpiling , and we &apos;ve stockpiled tamiflu in panic , in the belief that it will reduce the rate of complications of influenza .
and it hurts your throat .
we &apos;re being critical of the west , the perception of the west about our identity — about the image that is constructed about us , about our women , about our politics , about our religion .
that &apos;s shown in what i consider to be the most scary economic statistic of our time .
it evokes the container metaphor of communication , in which we conceive of ideas as objects , sentences as containers , and communication as a kind of sending .
one idea is that our three-dimensional universe may be embedded in a high-dimensional space , just as you can imagine on these sheets of paper .
it has a very large , thick atmosphere , and in fact , its surface environment was believed to be more like the environment we have here on the earth , or at least had in the past , than any other body in the solar system .
so that &apos;s as wide as we look at stories .
and then eventually , of course , they all did .
( laughter ) and this dot comes from that number .
so we want things that nest , we want things that stack , and we want it digitized .
the music was in some ways different , but in structure and form , very much the same .
we can &apos;t scale .
i actually don &apos;t buy this gloomy narrative , and i don &apos;t think you should either .
ynh : again , it &apos;s not a prophecy ; it &apos;s seeing all kinds of possibilities before us .
&quot; &quot; achilles was a man who could shape history , a man of destiny , and this is what you should be , alexander . &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what he heard .
now i never really asked my grandparents for anything .
i mean , how hard can it be ?
please enjoy .
and we had no clue where it was .
and bed nets have an effect on the epidemic , but you &apos;re never going to make it extinct with bed nets .
can we get complex 3d structure automatically assembling in inorganic systems ?
we didn &apos;t start out thinking that we were going to need mars watches .
humanity can finally learn from the information that it can collect , as part of our timeless quest to understand the world and our place in it , and that &apos;s why big data is a big deal .
( applause ) and this is what we discovered .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t also destroy it .
god no , it was therapy .
what have i heard during these last four days ?
( laughter ) i said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ll tell you what . i &apos;ll build you an arm that &apos;s under nine pounds that has all that capability in one year .
one of the dwarfs i got to know was a guy named clinton brown .
they were waiting to see what would happen , didn &apos;t trust insurance companies , or thought , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve managed for so many years .
gunpowder , cannon .
and it &apos;s speculated that some of their interest in the arts was designed to counter soviet communism and promote what it considered to be pro-american thoughts and aesthetics .
and these four groups are just the ants outside the nest .
i just spent all this time buying this product and now i have to charge before use .
indra saw the woman , a sekhri .
and i partnered with the school nutrition association , and did you know that a little over 30 million kids participate in school lunch programs every day .
bj : but when this little cub saw that i had vacated my seat and climbed to the back to get some camera gear , she came in like a curious cat to come and investigate .
here , craig is working the head .
and i think , as a conceptual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling , that makes it not much use .
or as my friend descartes might put it , we think , therefore we are .
they &apos;re places where we keep objects of great value to us , where we simply treasure them for them being themselves .
more fascinating , you have other countries — south africa , mauritius , namibia — all in single digits .
tk : all right . so that &apos;s exciting on where we may go with the better mechatronics , if we make them good enough to put out on the market and use in a field trial .
so , with all that information , the big question is — what do we actually — what does she tell us ?
it &apos;s about saving lives . how cool is that ?
those , then , are the ways in which older people are useful in traditional societies .
i hope you &apos;ll help us make this wish come true .
i know that as a scientist , i have information and as a human being , i can communicate with anybody , inside or outside of academia .
it started earth day .
that is your itinerary , you will probably travel 53,000 kilometers , visit around , i think , 46 institutions , and just fyi , you might release 10 tons of co2 emissions .
and depending on who you ask , the surge was supposed to push it up even further .
but i had a problem . once i had all these machines , i was spending too much time teaching students to use them .
and let me try to help you understand their perspective .
i didn &apos;t know what the rules were , i &apos;m a natural born scientist , i guess , or some kind of a throwback to the 17th century , whatever .
and this is actually what it looks like , hundreds of blood vessels , all growing toward the center of the wound .
i love pun and the relation to the unconscious .
what you find is that people are good at telling the difference between real and posed laughter .
and it was like holding onto a thousand horses .
it &apos;s very interesting . when we started our school the parents would give thumbprints in the attendance register .
the political vision of a terrorist organization is decided by the leadership , which , generally , is never more than five to seven people .
none of it in our textbooks . none of this in our textbooks .
is it metabolized in the liver ?
and how do we grow things like food that grew up on earth like us ?
read the license .
( laughter ) i &apos;m 71 .
giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem .
the only abrupt worldwide change would have been major asteroid impacts or volcanic super-eruptions .
we went to africa , sudan , sierra leone , liberia , kenya .
&quot; why does she want to meet us ? &quot;
as i began to think about stories like this and hear about stories like this , i began to ask myself and imagine : is there an alternative ?
now , these suppliers were our big companies .
what you &apos;re looking at is a phone looking at one after another picture of a bird , and actually not only saying , &quot; &quot; yes , it &apos;s a bird , &quot; &quot; but identifying the species of bird with a network of this sort .
and i think this starts with probably your physical body and fitness more than anything , because we can control that .
so why is high blood pressure so differentially deadly for black men ?
first of all , you know , for a long time computer games meant things like &quot; &quot; doom , &quot; &quot; where you &apos;re going around shooting things , very violent games , very fast , aimed at teenage boys . right ? that &apos;s who plays computer games .
he didn &apos;t read a note , and he was profoundly hearing impaired .
but let &apos;s think for a moment about jarrett &apos;s initial instinct .
so now — ( applause ) thank you .
same thing with laysan albatross who travel an entire ocean on a trip sometimes , up to the same zone the tunas use .
the benefits of doing so are enormous , the risks minimal .
it &apos;s made of asphalt , and asphalt is a very nice material to drive on , but not always , especially not on these days as today , when it &apos;s raining a lot .
so like in tennis , usually it &apos;s win-lose ; it always adds up to zero-zero-sum . but if you &apos;re playing doubles , the person on your side of the net , they &apos;re in the same boat as you , so you &apos;re playing a non-zero-sum game with them .
in the classroom , we have arguments on some of the most fiercely held moral convictions that students have about big public questions .
and so , what you &apos;ve seen today is less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here , and in the ted lab , we have a tour that was created by a six-year-old named benjamin that will knock your socks off . ( laughter ) so we &apos;ll see you there . thank you .
on the other hand , we now can understand how old the universe is .
it must be like that for kyu doing things with musicians — it &apos;s similar to that i would imagine — where you ... huh ?
and given the state of the world today , there &apos;s really no other option .
this particular reel — it &apos;s an industrial video — but it was shown in drive-in theaters in 1961 — in the detroit area , in fact — and it preceded alfred hitchcock &apos;s &quot; &quot; psycho . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so i like to think there was something going on there of the new generation of makers coming out of this , plus &quot; &quot; psycho . &quot; &quot; this is andrew archer .
it &apos;s perceived to be part of an elite agenda rather than something that benefits all .
to see what &apos;s going to happen , you can &apos;t just look at the workforce that is now , you have to look at our future workforce .
do you recall when i showed you these puzzle pieces ?
and i &apos;m not sure what the best way to organize the whole thing is .
you hurry , you get where you &apos;re going , but you get there alone .
the second , more honest way is to actually fix the model .
the negatives are gone .
( applause ) bruno giussani : mark , mark , come back . ( applause )
i think it gives an understanding of how we &apos;re picking out movement from what dan &apos;s doing , but i think it will also show you , if you look at that movement , that when dan makes music , his motions are very purposeful , very precise , very disciplined and they &apos;re also very beautiful .
and this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein is going to fold .
and sometimes that can be different amounts over different times or with different people or on different days .
it says , &quot; &quot; just knowing i can call you at four in the morning if i need to makes me not really need to , &quot; &quot; which i love , because together these are like , &quot; &quot; hallmark : when you care enough to send the very best twice , phrased slightly differently . &quot; &quot; i was not surprised at the tedster and new yorker magazine overlap .
why can &apos;t we ? why can &apos;t humans regenerate ?
take the fatihah , the seven-verse opening chapter that is the lord &apos;s prayer and the shema yisrael of islam combined .
central among them , a commitment to exclusively peaceful means .
we did it so fast we weren &apos;t prepared for their collapse .
take this tiger , for example .
and it &apos;s worth probably about three macbook pros .
or perhaps i should say , more accurately , señor pringle .
the seer of clouds had to take account of it .
i expect to live 100 years .
and it turns out that both human and other brains cost about the same , an average of six calories per billion neurons per day .
but wagner made an innovation .
violence can be stopped .
two days after , i was transferred to another place .
fred sexton was a friend of this guy , george hodel .
well , you have to find someone who is willing to be a surrogate .
so you photograph that in exactly the same position , and then you can substitute in — and that part does use photoshop — just the edges .
just then , with a loud bang , the heavens opened . ( claps ) and the god indra jumped into the clearing .
you can also see the evolution of the one-child-only policy as it travels through the bloodline .
we closed broadway from 42nd street to 47th street and created two and a half acres of new pedestrian space .
tori rebuilt the american pearl , and in december of 1999 , she did it .
let &apos;s say that if the physics of fusion is encoded into the universe , maybe the physics of life is as well .
and because nothing is more important to us than survival , the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe called the amygdala .
he even once traded a work of art for a block of government cheese because the person wanted it so badly .
again , it &apos;s kind of coming out of nowhere ; it &apos;s a little hard to use right now .
( applause ) okay . the point is it &apos;s really hard to tell , isn &apos;t it ? it &apos;s incredible , we looked at students do this and they couldn &apos;t tell .
governments don &apos;t naturally pick these things in the right way .
there are charts which show all these movements of information . that density of information is amazing .
this led me to starting a company called design within reach , a company dealing with simple forms , making good designers available to us , and also selling the personalities and character of the designers as well , and it seems to have worked .
you know .
coral reefs are chemists .
she talks with the women and explains that the land is barren because they have cut and sold the trees .
we stayed in old , crumbling , walled cities , in tiny little hotels , and we would climb up to the roof and drink vinho verde and watch the sun set and play checkers .
so i was thinking how i could explain myself better about how big and enormous this code is .
it &apos;s about an m.p. called geoffrey dickens .
and they made their own comics , starring the cartoon lunch lady alongside their actual lunch ladies .
now let &apos;s add a mycorrhiza plant into the diagram i used earlier .
we all know that as we form thoughts , they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains .
so it seems right .
and my job is to look at lots of different species of animals and try to figure out how their tissues and organs work when everything &apos;s going right , rather than trying to figure out how to fix things when they go wrong , like so many of you .
and this gets us back to the mushrooms .
and you then feel you must act .
and what it is — it &apos;s a twist on health .
and not just us . it &apos;s also kids .
will it be under $ 20 ?
our collective vision at naya jeevan , which for many of you , as you all recognize , means &quot; &quot; new life &quot; &quot; in urdu and hindi , is to rejuvenate the lives of millions of low income families by providing them with affordable access to catastrophic health care .
right ? so these guys are kind of the hungry and foolish and colorful guys , right ?
because the zetas organization was founded in treason , they lost some of the linkages to the production and distribution in the most profitable markets like cocaine , but what they did have , and this is again based on their military origin , was a perfectly structured chain of command with a very clear hierarchy and a very clear promotion path that allowed them to supervise and operate across many , many markets very effectively , which is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do .
and they did this by painstaking observations of numerous distant galaxies , allowing them to chart how the expansion rate has changed over time .
i have given the slide show that i gave here two years ago about 2,000 times .
jodi lomask , and her wonderful troupe capacitor , joined me in the canopy in my rainforest site in costa rica .
we &apos;ve literally consumed an entire river in north america for irrigation .
and yet when i think of the poverty of society which doesn &apos;t give freedom to its people , i don &apos;t admire those buildings .
my personality was entombed within a seemingly silent body , a vibrant mind hidden in plain sight within a chrysalis .
voice 1 : you &apos;ll have to stay here in the safe house until we get word the terrorist threat is over .
now that i know it &apos;s a photograph , i &apos;ve got dozens of other binary translation techniques to visualize and understand that information , so in a matter of seconds , we can take this information , shove it through a dozen other visual translation techniques in order to find out exactly what we were looking at .
it &apos;s the first working prototype of the clock .
and whenever we discuss one of these problems that we have to address — child labor in cottonseed farms in india — this year we will monitor 50,000 cottonseed farms in india .
and technology was going to carry us along .
and it was in this , preliminary to these pieces of furniture , that ricky and i worked on furniture by the slice .
the other way is to change the type of food .
it &apos;s bigger than the difference between the microbes in this reef and the microbes in this prairie .
and he took lithium , and he went down the line .
auke ijspeert : absolutely . so the robot — we have some spin-off projects where we would like to use the robots to do search and rescue inspection , so this robot is now seeing you .
we regarded each other , scrutinized one another .
i &apos;m going to start by asking you a question : is anyone familiar with the blue algae problem ?
the first thing you will notice on signing up to one of these sites is how familiar it looks .
i study ants in the desert , in the tropical forest and in my kitchen , and in the hills around silicon valley where i live .
have you ever hoped that there was some ability you hadn &apos;t discovered yet that you were just naturally great at ?
have you ever eaten a booger long past your childhood ?
this is not a wardrobe malfunction . i have to take my belt off here .
that &apos;s actually not true .
by coincidence , as lorna and judith worked behind the scenes to reform the criteria , people all over the world were seeing an autistic adult for the first time .
this may seem minor , but it is terrifying to hear rumor after rumor after rumor that another tidal wave , bigger than the last , will be coming at exactly 1 p.m. , or perhaps tonight , or perhaps ...
and i could spend hours talking about them , because they &apos;re all kind of heroes .
in that same year , i &apos;ve found out , only 20 % of people had used these surgery-bank checks .
we had the journalist &#91; heather &#93; brooke speaking about her battle against government corruption , and she introduced me to this website , alaveteli.com.
i mean it &apos;s , &quot; &quot; i have my friends , therefore i am . &quot; &quot; lt : ( laughter ) jf : no , it &apos;s true .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve noticed , but there &apos;s been a spate of books that have come out lately contemplating or speculating on the cognition and emotional life of dogs .
on the other hand , if you &apos;re visiting an underdeveloped country , and 25 dollars buys you a gourmet meal , it &apos;s exorbitant for a big mac .
2005 , anthony fitzherbert , an agricultural engineer , could travel through helmand , could stay in nad ali , sangin and ghoresh , which are now the names of villages where fighting is taking place .
and i was on fire — excruciating , excruciating pain .
tom &apos;s hand . tom &apos;s hand . tom &apos;s hand . ( laughter ) anyway .
what if we zoomed out and actually tried to experience our own cultural big bang ?
some people have called a cyberwar what may actually be just a spy operation — and obviously , a quite mishandled one .
we proposed a building that was audacious , that was different than any of the forms that the community was used to , and we were scared and our client was scared and the community was scared , so we created a series of photorealistic renderings that we put onto facebook and we put onto instagram , and we let people start to do what they do : share it , comment , like it , hate it .
we live in one world .
on the right-hand side , &#91; 0,0 &#93; input is a 1 output , which goes up .
recently , i showed this to my students , and i just asked them to try and explain why it happened .
another example , this was completely packed with houses , and then we built this , what we call , a knowledge square .
so , there &apos;s another picture . here , this one . i really do like this picture .
he showed him , &quot; &quot; you know , we don &apos;t have to do this wrong .
the last time you were in the presence of a baby — this happens to be my granddaughter , mitra .
and if you pick up one of those magazines , it &apos;s hard to resist , isn &apos;t it ?
with tania singer at the max planck institute of leipzig , we showed that the brain networks for empathy and loving-kindness are different .
i was thinking , i &apos;m mutilated ? i &apos;m a mutilated person .
you can be a general , a politician , an economist who is depressed , a musician in a minor key , a painter in dark colors .
and then we introduce them to somebody who they come to hate immediately , the drill sergeant .
yes , we built our first satellite prototype in our garage .
the reason why we forgot that is because the times in history when architecture did the most to transform society were those times when , actually , the one percent would build on behalf of the 99 percent , for various different reasons , whether that was through philanthropy in the 19th century , communism in the early 20th , the welfare state , and most recently , of course , through this inflated real estate bubble .
but the one thing they didn &apos;t capture was making love .
and so what i want to do with you in , oh god , only 10 minutes , is to really think again this juxtaposition , because it actually has massive , massive implications beyond innovation policy , which just happens to be the area that i often talk with with policymakers .
you put it in your search engine , and you create the drug to treat the threat .
i &apos;m going to share with you some of the exciting work that &apos;s going on .
powered by the massive data from imagenet and the modern cpus and gpus to train such a humongous model , the convolutional neural network blossomed in a way that no one expected .
this is a korean church that we did in queens .
and for me , the man of steel , christopher reeve , has best raised the awareness on the distress of spinal cord injured people .
these animals , they were being demonized .
now comedy travels along a distinct wavelength from other forms of language .
and he says , &quot; &quot; i want my cheese sandwich . &quot; &quot; and he takes this one .
but this conclusion would ignore a tectonic shift taking place in egypt far from the cameras in tahrir square .
but my spirit is strong as ever .
and so , those two individuals have different numbers of friends .
and just now in england they had a cold spell .
we are now the major agent of impact on our earth .
i was all set to be a diplomat , teacher , doctor — all laid out .
allow me to try to answer this question in the few coming minutes .
you can see a timeline , showing you the exciting moments throughout the story .
that narrative of gratitude runs through a lot of the stories i hear .
he said in his lifetime he had climbed a great mountain , the mountain of challenging and then defeating racial oppression and defeating apartheid .
so this behavior of risk avoidance is a very old evolutionary response .
well in surgery , you couldn &apos;t have people who are more specialized and you couldn &apos;t have people who are better trained .
if you just run the simulation , it will just collapse , like this .
and this is the ability to program physical and biological materials to change shape , change properties and even compute outside of silicon-based matter .
i remember one particularly low moment .
and the maps of violence in most u.s. cities looked like this .
they are not meant to stay .
( laughter ) ( applause ) so we are natural-born dualists .
so what does play do for the brain ?
this has to be described as an adventure , not a burden .
alzheimer &apos;s disease : there &apos;s five million people affected , and you can check vital signs , activity , balance .
and you start to see things .
well , he told me .
( laughter ) allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame .
what will we know ? what will we learn ?
so why are screens so pervasive in our analog life ?
you should always use a condom , &quot; &quot; and yet , in her relationship , she &apos;s not empowered — what &apos;s going to happen ?
one can become an object of public ridicule because of a misplaced b.
it &apos;s not one of these statistics which is very doubtful .
you sell your products more expensively .
and the large companies , they typically have wonderful wellness programs , but the medium-sized companies that typically fall between the cracks on issues like this , they started to get engaged and used our program as a model for their own employees to try and have contests to see who might be able to deal with their obesity situation in a way that could be proactively beneficial to others .
we &apos;re going to learn how to make one flap .
i thought , &quot; &quot; oh gracious , if these two players , either one of them &quot; &quot; — they were different years , but i thought about each one at the time he was there — &quot; &quot; oh , if he ever makes the varsity , our varsity must be pretty miserable , if he &apos;s good enough to make it . &quot; &quot; and you know , one of them was a starting player for a season and a half .
so the train is now pulling into the third stop along the 6 line .
and another story of the cylinder begins .
you &apos;re seeing a plot .
as a scientist , i always wanted to measure that resonance , that sense of the other that happens so quickly , in the blink of an eye .
thinking , how can that be ? you &apos;re cheating . the lines are curved .
secondly , in the communist ideology , there &apos;s no place for criticism .
( applause )
again , chiming with your view that china has a militarized regime ready to , you know , mobilize its enormous forces .
this is a spectacular coral garden .
all right . i understand . if you &apos;re unwilling to — all right , well , we can discuss that after class .
i was not a great student .
but because so many of the issues in education aren &apos;t just in school , they &apos;re in family and community , what you also need , definitely , is more on the right hand side .
imagine that that earth is at the center of the universe , and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere .
you are somebody who wants to make a difference .
but you also have to provide usable evidence that you are trustworthy .
five or less digits . so , if you &apos;re in the tens of thousands you &apos;ve got to sit down .
we worked like dogs down in the garment industry every single day .
i want us all to change the verb .
now , there &apos;s no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of brad superimposed over another actor &apos;s body .
( laughter ) but what about this day , this one particular friday ?
less than one day of exxon &apos;s revenues .
once we &apos;ve discovered somebody has low vision , the next big challenge is to work out why , and to be able to do that , we need to have access to the inside of the eye .
there are different programs for graduate students , for executives at different companies .
and i wonder what he &apos;s soaking in .
i particularly like the little linux penguin in the back . ( laughter ) so one of the things that that &apos;s leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion .
the first paradox is that growing up is about rejecting the past and then promptly reclaiming it .
to just bring them to justice . &quot; &quot; but of course , they don &apos;t listen .
i should be able to ask my house where my shoes are .
so like the periodic table , we came up with our own table of the elements : new lifeforms that were computationally grown , additively manufactured and biologically augmented .
here &apos;s the mr. it provides the framework .
the closer one gets , the more new features one discovers .
but there &apos;s also another problem from ships that i &apos;m illustrating here , and that &apos;s the problem of collision .
and to me this was a key component that somehow , through this medium of photography , which allows us to contemplate these landscapes , that i thought photography was perfectly suited to doing this type of work .
and there &apos;s a difference there too , because if we , you in the audience , or i , if we decide to have a designer baby , then their children will also be genetically modified , and so on , because it &apos;s heritable .
my head snapped back over my red seat .
that was designed on that machine , in the woods behind the institute .
what i want to do more generally is to get you thinking about the place of uncertainty and randomness and chance in our world , and how we react to that , and how well we do or don &apos;t think about it .
he was strong , steady , disciplined .
i found this one watering hole , and felt if everything remained the same way it was behaving , i had a real opportunity to capture something unique .
( laughter ) so i &apos;m sorry about that .
we &apos;re talking about energy .
it &apos;s fundamental to darwin and mendel and so on .
thank you very much indeed . ( applause )
our city is very spread out .
i &apos;m going to argue that , in fact , business strategy has always been premised on assumptions about technology , that those assumptions are changing , and , in fact , changing quite dramatically , and that therefore what that will drive us to is a different concept of what we mean by business strategy .
i &apos;m a corporate lawyer most of the time for an organization called enablis that supports entrepreneurs in south africa .
and that &apos;s a little image of the tree of stansted .
that all seems like win to me .
and i fell into those thousands of connections that i &apos;d made , and i asked my crowd to catch me .
there was no place to stay , so i stuck my computer in , i went away , came back after a couple of months , found kids playing games on it .
so , describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt . go ahead .
and it &apos;s a rare fungus .
principle number two : we have to recognize and celebrate diversity in this stuff .
however , huge supercomputer analyses , done of the likely effectiveness of this , show that it won &apos;t buy us much time at all .
what you &apos;ve done makes people laugh and then think .
and they know how to bring it back because they have demystified one big myth , which is the myth of spontaneity , which is that it &apos;s just going to fall from heaven while you &apos;re folding the laundry like a deus ex machina , and in fact they understood that whatever is going to just happen in a long-term relationship , already has .
so the idea is that we get the speed and efficiency benefits of using these physical dials together with the flexibility and versatility of a system that &apos;s designed in software .
so , there &apos;s plenty of non-zero-sumness .
should one of them stop working or reduce hours to be home ?
in other words , they mastered the art of doing more with less , which is the essence of frugal innovation .
left home .
so i think that actually step two , that i called a step a moment ago , isn &apos;t a step at all .
what am i doing this for ?
and a variety of other studies have shown that the microbial community that lives in and on us helps in development of the immune system , helps in fighting off pathogens , helps in our metabolism , and determining our metabolic rate , probably determines our odor , and may even shape our behavior in a variety of ways .
but unfortunately , he died prematurely in 1970 , and so he wasn &apos;t really able to live that dream completely .
it makes use of the gps — you &apos;re familiar with gps in your automobile , but you may not be familiar with the fact that there &apos;s a gps u.s. , there &apos;s a russian gps , and there &apos;s a new gps system going to europe , called galileo .
you know , that &apos;s not good enough .
it &apos;s even on thongs , but compressed to &quot; &quot; how about never — is never good for you ? &quot; &quot; now these look like very different forms of humor but actually they bear a great similarity .
they said , one , the bridge doesn &apos;t exist .
if you go on , that &apos;s a slightly more complicated program that &apos;s now doing all sorts of algorithmic things and creating user interface and so on .
so i sent a cold email to info @ equaljusticeintiative.org : &quot; &quot; dear bryan , &quot; &quot; it said , &quot; &quot; i think your building project is maybe the most important project we could do in america and could change the way we think about racial injustice .
ln : and at some point , she noticed something .
because to imitate a complex act requires my brain to adopt the other person &apos;s point of view .
thirteen species — highest diversity we can find in one single area in africa .
and one night , there &apos;s a knock at his hotel room door .
it was 11 : 50pm .
mm : it starts playing immediately .
they &apos;re ways in which we can have greater choice for refugees beyond those basic , impossible three options i explained to you and still leave others better off .
we find that if we get them out of institutions and into loving families early on , they recover their developmental delays , and go on to lead normal , happy lives .
is it something as obvious as that jealousy , which boils down into person , desire , impediment , is such a solid narrative foundation ?
the experts call this the girl effect .
and before we have the debate , i &apos;d like to actually take a show of hands — on balance , right now , are you for or against this ?
for every dollar given to a women &apos;s program , 20 dollars are given to men &apos;s programs .
and what have you always wanted to ask someone from the other side ?
when the terrorist incidents occurred in the united kingdom a couple of years ago , i think even though they didn &apos;t claim as many lives as we lost in the united states on 9 / 11 , i think the thing that troubled the british most was that the perpetrators were not invaders , but homegrown citizens whose religious and political identities were more important to them than the people they grew up with , went to school with , worked with , shared weekends with , shared meals with .
( laughter ) if you put it next to contemporary architecture , it feels totally natural to me .
so i just want to welcome all of you onto the ride .
and it was through crowd-sourcing , it was through the kindness that strangers were showing me , that i could uncover parts of my past that were haunting me .
i &apos;ve been at this for 30 years , and in that time i &apos;ve seen the ability , the commitment , the will of government to do this decline , and i don &apos;t see them making a comeback right now .
i lived with incredible birds , incredible animals , i swam in our small rivers with our caimans .
and we keep setting our expectations higher and higher .
so don &apos;t hang on till the bitter end .
deah and his wife yusor were a young married couple living in chapel hill , north carolina , where they both went to school .
but every generation has the chance to make it better .
and i &apos;m not going to take them somewhere and say , one day all of this will be yours .
they start at the surface of the brain , and then they dive down into the tissue itself , and as they spread out , they supply nutrients and oxygen to each and every cell in the brain .
what we want is to make sure that those individuals with autism can be free from the devastating consequences that come with it at times , the profound intellectual disabilities , the lack of language , the profound , profound isolation .
a-rhythm-etic . audience : a-rhythm-etic .
they &apos;ve bounded the city with a line .
the president of ethiopia said he would do it .
naghma lived in a refugee camp with her parents and her eight brothers and sisters .
ca : so that seems like a win for the consumer .
so my moment of truth did not come all at once .
this is a very nice pattern , and it &apos;s true , because 5 + 5 = 2 • 5 , etc .
but it also tells us something about policy .
so you &apos;ve got a lot of information . that &apos;s great .
now it &apos;s all done on my iphone , and it all goes straight up to my server , and my server does all the backend work and categorizes things and puts everything together .
they are the slaves .
and yet what we proved then is the u.s. has more market power than opec .
how do we get that to a million ?
and he wished me luck and he gave me some free books and he showed me out the door .
by that i mean , not just the choice to use a gene drive , but also the choice not to use one .
let me step back and take a look at why the city is so good for the blind .
that component is that we cannot be attached to outcome .
ca : wait , wait , wait , not doing anything ?
we can also magnify small mechanical movements , like vibrations in engines , that can help engineers detect and diagnose machinery problems , or see how our buildings and structures sway in the wind and react to forces .
i went to congo with msf , and contributed to a book and an exhibition that focused attention on a forgotten war in which millions of people have died , and exposure to disease without treatment is used as a weapon .
and none of this takes more money and none of this demands a bureaucracy , but it does demand that you think things differently and you are prepared to bend budgets and work programs in order to create that supportive framework that communities can bounce off .
except it &apos;s supposed to be brown .
here , instead of through the lens of a genome , through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record .
( laughter ) so , i couldn &apos;t let myself feel condescending towards these boys .
now , david builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab , but before he does that , he works with dancers to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place .
now , the best way of ending human suffering caused by war is to never go to war .
so let &apos;s start off by defining some terms .
you leave aside what is natural to be natural .
so when we went through the numbers , and just added that up — how much nuclear do we see china and india bringing online over the next 15 years , how much do we see at risk of being taken offline — this was the most startling finding .
few high schoolers had access to computers in those days .
and that is , of course , europe .
but of course , lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy .
in different contexts , cells do different things .
the life of a small-shareholder farmer is miserable .
and as you &apos;ll notice , it &apos;s still pretty gosh darn fast slowed down 333 times . it &apos;s an incredibly powerful movement .
in situations where you can &apos;t go about thinking how you &apos;d reverse this feeling of injustice , you can still think , maybe not what you can do , but what you can not do .
i blush whenever i show this .
so if this theory were true then it meant that light as it passed the sun should actually be bent around it .
some of that &apos;s good : oxfam , a great non-governmental actor .
and i have a volunteer subject in the audience today , julie .
and in fact , if you compare it to data , it fits very well with the development of cities and economies .
and this is an excerpt from my first editor &apos;s letter , where i say that rookie , we don &apos;t have all the answers , we &apos;re still figuring it out too , but the point is not to give girls the answers , and not even give them permission to find the answers themselves , but hopefully inspire them to understand that they can give themselves that permission , they can ask their own questions , find their own answers , all of that , and rookie , i think we &apos;ve been trying to make it a nice place for all of that to be figured out .
and experience is not just a kind of entertainment in a non-casual way .
and who &apos;s responsible ? designers .
and yamaha makes an incredible thing called the disklavier pro that looks like a nice grand piano there .
it can be deadly .
so whatever you get that can make you happy can go away .
it &apos;s a very frightening , very , very frightening thought .
it is the same in the 21st century . that &apos;s why i am going to decide to give this machine only for poor women across india .
i remember a journal article about this new question answering software that had a graph .
instead , she said , &quot; &quot; no , no . work and leisure can be together . &quot; &quot; yeah , that &apos;s particularly gorgeous — it &apos;s the tv dinner of 2001 .
it &apos;s out in the middle of the pacific , right around the equator .
so there was only one possibility — to bring the column out of the computer .
i hope when you learn things , like about how the natural world works — i just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper or you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child .
so cyber weapons are dangerous by nature , but in addition , they &apos;re emerging in a much more unstable environment .
and sneakerheads are the ones who drive the marketing and the hype and the pr and the brand cachet , and enable nike to sell millions of $ 60 sneakers .
well it so happens that we have a singular body .
the inventors don &apos;t know what the invention is .
this is the most disruptive technology — i &apos;ve been told by executives of the pesticide industry — that they have ever witnessed .
with the help of the family , they cross oceans , they cross deserts , they cross rivers , they cross mountains .
of my four-and-a-half-year commandship in that district , three years in , after putting pastors in the car with my police because i knew this — it &apos;s a little secret — i knew this : it was hard to stay a nasty police officer while you &apos;re riding around with a clergy .
now the first interface is called a drivegrip .
people &apos;s moral values , they &apos;re their most deeply held beliefs .
thank you .
so what happens if you start to explain space to them ?
here is a list of last year &apos;s graduates , graduated in june , and what they &apos;re currently doing — 48 of them .
now , sylvia browne is the big operator .
the conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold was able to learn .
i stay . if i go , i will be killed .
and by rating it and by rating the different people who submit information , we can get refined results and weighted results .
the cab stopped , and i pulled my body from it feeling each ounce of weight as i walked to the elevator .
and we think that this alignment is necessary for communication .
i was at the top of the general assembly just looking down into it and seeing it happen .
she looks at me like i &apos;m her , you know , her moron child , the cretin , the one she &apos;s got to speak to very slowly and distinctly .
and so that &apos;s what makes me lie awake at night , i guess , you know .
there are people now online that are friends ; they &apos;ve never met .
now i have carefully cropped this sequence to be exactly the duration of a human eye blink , so in the time that it would take you to blink your eye , the fly has seen this looming predator , estimated its position , initiated a motor pattern to fly it away , beating its wings at 220 times a second as it does so .
lots of people are used to having a spiritual tribe , or a church tribe , having a work tribe , having a community tribe .
if i zoom on it , you can see : that &apos;s the rover on the surface .
that &apos;s why i like what i do .
so that &apos;s one thing , to introduce the idea of doubt into graphics .
( dolphin noises ) you see , they &apos;re synchronizing with their partner as well as the other dyad .
beautiful , because it has symmetry .
this is a photograph taken about 100 years ago of my grandfather and great-grandfather .
i &apos;ll never forget that day back in the spring of 2006 .
i don &apos;t mean to be rude , but you know what a psychopath is .
he had installed the heavy equipment for his new process in an abandoned store in the vicinity of kings mountain , and for two months these 16 men would live and work together , mastering the new process .
in the words of the poet longfellow , &quot; the human voice is the organ of the soul . &quot;
( laughter ) every country is different and it &apos;s confusing , okay ?
and in the intervening years i had two daughters .
and now , brrrrrrrrrr , just like when you were a kid .
it was complex , but there was something capricious about its complexity .
but that doesn &apos;t mean we shouldn &apos;t do everything in our power to protect the environments that we rely and depend on , and like everest , the remote location and inadequate infrastructure of the orbital environment make waste disposal a challenging problem .
and that &apos;s also a higher hurdle . people drop out .
audience : 1966 .
to the top right of the graph , are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well-being , but they &apos;re using a lot of planet to get there .
so the next time a victim of a privacy violation comes up to you , instead of blaming them , let &apos;s do this instead : let &apos;s shift our ideas about digital privacy , and let &apos;s respond with compassion .
but it &apos;s still true that a neuron , a nerve cell , looks the same in a crayfish , a bird or you .
he would promote the policeman immediately , so that p.c. bloggs became detective inspector bloggs in the course of the conversation and wave us on merrily .
let &apos;s see by a show of hands .
why don &apos;t we see more innovation in sanitation ?
but we can let that insecurity make us brittle or supple .
it &apos;s a simple choice , so we &apos;ve worked for many years with the forest stewardship council , with literally hundreds of other organizations , and there &apos;s a point here about collaboration .
first one : forbid installation on ground zero .
acinetobacter is a nasty hospital bug , and carbapenem is pretty much the strongest class of antibiotics that we can throw at this bug .
since i &apos;m home-schooled , i went to go hear him speak one day .
( to audience ) thank you , guys .
after treatment , the child gains significant functionality .
they had six million between them — and we beat them .
we used quantitative arteriography , showing the narrowing .
my measurements .
now , the rate is still too high — still too many people unnecessarily losing their lives .
shyness is about fear of social judgment .
so you ’ ve got that covered .
when i was a student at mit , we all shared one computer that took up a whole building .
and when they find them they pull them out and they pin them to the wall like butterflies .
for fashionistas , they want to stay ahead of the curve .
( video ) so you &apos;re me , and you &apos;re in math class yet again , because they make you go every single day .
it turns out that everyone &apos;s anecdotal experience out camping is actually true .
the devices are also biodegradable .
and as i &apos;ve shown here , we have the audience .
i didn &apos;t have to think about the notes .
we need now to adopt a new conception of agriculture .
so i said , have what , shall i translate the internet into some indian language ? that &apos;s not possible .
and here &apos;s an example .
the issue of privacy and personal data is much bigger than just the government , and so learn the facts .
when this happened to me 17 years ago , there was no name for it .
and when i have the question , it is a focus .
take a look at gabby .
the landscape has sadly become much more populated with instances like mine , whether or not someone actually make a mistake , and now it &apos;s for both public and private people .
so , the tiger is the icon .
and we have to resist to the changes .
and one of the first things that we discovered that i think is really helpful for understanding polarization is to understand that the political divide in our country is undergirded by a deeper moral divide .
and when the sun shines , you get copious quantities of these things , called neutrinos , pouring out .
crossing miles and miles of sastrugi — frozen ice snowdrifts that could be hip-deep .
but what you do know is that that introduction was nothing short of transformative .
one of my viewer &apos;s uncles died on a particular day and he chose to commemorate it with a piece of hate .
i &apos;ve met a lot of them .
if she is married to a man she doesn &apos;t like or if she is married to an old man , she has to accept , because she does not want to be dubbed as disobedient .
together you have changed the zeitgeist from analog to digital , and pushed the boundaries .
so i am convinced that if we can unlock the technologies that are commonplace in the richer world to be able to transform foods .
when the wildfires broke out in san diego , in october of 2007 , people turned to twitter to report what was happening and to find information from neighbors about what was happening around them .
it ain &apos;t okay . you know what ? it is not okay .
there &apos;s a whole gray market for lego , thousands of home-based businesses .
( laughter ) ( applause ) ( music ) sb : we ended up at what was advertised as the world &apos;s largest speed dating event .
so there is this key benefit that is relevant to state policy makers in terms of economic development .
the thing that caused massive policy changes to occur was race to the top for education .
and we learn and adapt the program accordingly .
and that was the job of the journalist . it was filtering all this stuff .
they are all remodeled . they all become specialized for the task at hand .
quite nice in itself , they &apos;re little , sort of , airplane things .
they were mostly reacting to my accent , that it is not normal for a narrator to have an accent .
in the u.k. we have an epidemic of facial injuries among young people .
thank you .
when you have a non-stick pan , it costs about , maybe , 250 rupees , five dollars , six dollars .
eighty-five to 95 percent of species at this time die out , and simultaneous to that is a huge , dramatic spike in carbon dioxide , that a lot of scientists agree comes from a simultaneous eruption of volcanoes and a runaway greenhouse effect .
it means that you can &apos;t get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so much .
is it a part of a circle ?
we feel awkward and shameful talking about it .
dp : when a guy is happily married , no matter what happens at work , no matter what happens in the rest of the day , there &apos;s a shelter when you get home , there &apos;s a knowledge knowing that you can hug somebody without them throwing you downstairs and saying , &quot; &quot; get your hands off me . &quot; &quot; being married is like having a color television set .
and there &apos;s all this crap sort of circling around it , dust and stuff .
but what if you had to drive four hours to charge your phone because you had no reliable source of electricity ?
he was talking about the space aliens .
one way to change our genes is to make new ones , as craig venter has so elegantly shown .
it can be in a basket . it can be in a loaf pan , but we pan it .
ca : but to make this happen , you have to look at each part in the chain — the police , who else ?
i also see a world where we can erase unwanted memories .
but it &apos;s also useful , because it tells us that extreme simplicity in movement rules at the individual level can result in a great deal of complexity at the level of the group .
bia &apos;s school stayed in place .
but let &apos;s start off by remembering that darwin showed how we &apos;re the outcome of four billion years of evolution .
it was around this time we went from 1k to 16k , which was quite the leap .
now , like doc edgerton , a scientist himself , science became art — an art of ultra-fast photography .
( applause )
for every four barrels of oil that we consume , we only discover one .
the more i thought about it , i realized , no , it &apos;s still important .
and in just four weeks , the brain learns to process this new sensation and acquires a new sensory pathway — like a new sense .
it gives it information . by adding information to matter , it gives it a function that &apos;s different than without that structure .
but we also know it &apos;s only through experiment that we &apos;ll discover exactly how to run a low carbon city , how to care for a much older population , how to deal with drug addiction and so on .
as a matter of fact , we added to the contract .
( applause ) we &apos;ve hired and trained hundreds of facilitators to help guide people through the experience .
he said , &quot; &quot; what do you think it &apos;s like trying to run a country with 400 kinds of cheese ? &quot; &quot; but at the same time , we realize that our products are not safe and healthy .
( applause )
mk : yeah , we were friends for a long time .
and this is about good taste , good traditions .
yeah .
true story . true story .
we don &apos;t know the details of how this works , but we do know then that foxo genes can impact the lifespan of people .
if you look at our ancestors , the neanderthals and the homo erectus , our immediate ancestors , they &apos;re confined to small regions of the world .
what you just heard is &quot; &quot; skylife &quot; &quot; by david balakrishnan .
she said things she &apos;d always needed to say .
we also recognize that a lot of the products that we make — those videos and so forth — you know , they don &apos;t reach everybody , and so we &apos;ve been fostering projects that reach people outside of academia , and outside of the choir that most ecologists preach to .
this is why basically you have all this creative mistrust between the representatives and those whom they represent .
over the course of last year , open-source hardware hackers have come up with multiple models for usable , linux-based mobile phones , and the earth phone could spin off from this kind of project .
the greek word poem , it just means &quot; &quot; a made thing , &quot; &quot; and poetry is a set of techniques , ways of making patterns that put emotions into words .
so that &apos;s an asset because if you &apos;ve got to deal with the crash protection issues of the automobile , forget it — you &apos;re never going to fly it .
now , the irony is , of course , that every large company started off as a small , entrepreneurial company .
i was at one of their fundraising events earlier this year , and i was inspired to give a one-off donation when i remembered that my firm offers to match the charitable contributions its employees make .
she &apos;s here . she &apos;s also a doctor .
it &apos;s real stuff .
this is an old bicycle tube , which gives you a broad rubber band , two safety pins .
we actually met on mission blue i in the galapagos .
i get to read about mother-in-law jokes from mesopotamia from 3,500 years ago .
i &apos;m going to make a cut right there .
and you can see here that what it &apos;s doing is it &apos;s recording my eyes every time i blink .
there were no motel 6 &apos;s or howard johnsons for me .
and then the kids graduate , and you have no responsibility any more — that &apos;s very good , too .
( applause )
and that will stop reusing a syringe 20 or 30 times .
i asked them to name me just 20 .
so you ask yourself , if education has become so much more expensive , has it become so much better ?
think enron , madoff , the mortgage crisis .
it &apos;s an acknowledgment of need or fallibility .
if you look over the past couple decades at the returns to capital — in other words , corporate profits — we see them going up , and we see that they &apos;re now at an all-time high .
and i pressed her , and i asked her , &quot; why did you come back and get your care here ? &quot;
the male c.o.s want to talk and flirt with the female c.o.s.
the second is , you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place .
( laughter ) so this is not trivial , given the idea that we want to revive extinct species , because it turns out that an african and an asian elephant can actually interbreed and have live young , and this has actually occurred by accident in a zoo in chester , u.k. , in 1978 .
the green movement significantly inspired the world .
how do i make sense out of it ?
in blizzard winds , the crew sling ropes between the tents so that people can feel their way safely to the nearest ice house and to the nearest outhouse .
( laughter ) because they actually said that you can get any color you like in a spectrum .
now james , like millions of people behind bars , is an example of what happens if we believe that our failings don &apos;t define who we are , that we are all worthy of redemption and if we support those impacted by mass incarceration , we can all heal together .
76 countries in the last 12 years , i &apos;ve visited .
we , as global citizens , now have a unique opportunity to accelerate large-scale positive change around the world .
the stories we tell about each other matter very much .
i mean , there &apos;s a bit , but it &apos;s not what gets people up in the morning , what keeps them at their desks .
apple undoubtedly brings this innovation to us early , but its time was approaching because its core technology had been evolving for decades .
this replicates around europe and much of the liberal democratic world .
i remember the night that i read about the series of coordinated bombings in the subway system in madrid , and i got up and i walked over to the crib where my six-month-old baby girl lay sleeping sweetly , and i heard the rhythm of her breath , and i felt this sense of urgency coursing through my body .
even though i &apos;ve traveled a lot , i still think like an american woman .

the encyclopedia is just one in a long line of arabic erotica , much of it written by religious scholars .
they never even got out of their clothes .
lots of scientists did a lot of work to make crispr happen , and what &apos;s interesting to me is that these scientists are being supported by our society .
and as the father was administering these instructions , a car drove by , slowly , and just after it passed the father and the teenagers , a hand went out from the front passenger window , and — &quot; &quot; bam , bam ! &quot; &quot; — killing the father .

and then , as he was doing that , he made an accidental click by hitting the touchpad — you &apos;ll see him do that .
and it is , to prevent rickets and so on .
and so , what did they test her for ?
we made progress in a lot of the areas like automated harvesting and efficient lighting .
now , this is subject to a lot of debate and controversy .
so again this is what they can see under the microscope .
audience : shake .
her mother &apos;s doing everything she can .
this would tell you , you don &apos;t have my permission to send this image out .
( laughter ) by far .
you know , maybe it &apos;s not just humans at the right side of this chain that &apos;s duncey .
any one of you who gardens knows that there is something called the root-shoot ratio , and plants need to keep the root mass in some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy .
we &apos;re going to force you to act against your will , to bend to our will . &quot; &quot; then , number two , we keep these rules a secret from the dog .

and today , artists armed with that emotion , are grasping anatomy from the medical world , and are reinvigorating it through art in the most imaginative ways .
but originally the significance of the bindi is to symbolize the third eye between the spiritual world and the religious world .
that &apos;s what i call globalization chinese style .
so i set out to study electrical engineering and robotics , and my end-of-studies project was about building a robot called er-1 — it looked like this — that would collect information from its environment and proceed to follow a white line on the ground .
what we do is the exact opposite .
as you can see , the brain area is going up and down in each one of them , but the responses are very different , and not in sync .
and then marge deton .
this last fall , i went to the snow and ice data center in boulder , colorado , and talked to the researchers here in monterey at the naval postgraduate laboratory .
this is , of course , unless your whole life is about being secure .
what was my calling ? what should i do ?
the reason is you never go and bother to ask the losers who also purchased lottery tickets and didn &apos;t end up winning the prize .
none of the straight lines are actually straight .
but they get a lot more information about what you do online , what you like , what interests you .
they send it out for amateur rocketeers , and it said in there do not ever heat a mixture of potassium perchlorate and sugar .
his name was john belk . some of you will probably know him .

&#91; bbc news : &apos; end of virginity &apos; if women drive , saudi cleric warns &#93; ( laughter ) and only then we realized it &apos;s so empowering to mock your oppressor .
let &apos;s now see how the rest and the west compares in terms of how rich you are .
and one story i want to tell you about is how can we find targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder — a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear .
and civic leaders should deploy sensors and civic drones to detect rogue drones , and instead of sending killer drones of their own up to shoot them down , they should notify humans to their presence .
they made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work .
easy , right ?
it was all i did .
&#91; jennifer brea is sound-sensitive .
and you can see we got a guy from — who &apos;s just a fanatic about dinosaurs to do the sculpting for us , down to the spoon-shaped teeth and everything .
he comes back and instead of deciding that , well , now since i &apos;ve lost my leg , that second dream is over , he decides that he still has that dream of playing baseball , and he starts this group called vetsports , which now works with veterans all over the country and uses sports as a way of healing .

at 12,000 feet , where the air is thin , i once built two hole in the wall computers , and the children flocked there .
now , montel williams is an intelligent man .
for example , brazil — this beautiful country hosting tedglobal has the world &apos;s ugliest record .
and i would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice , that i was making a three-dimensional drawing of a horse that somehow moves in space .
and so that was the idea .
man 7 : after this bridge , first exit .
we should find out what they &apos;re doing and transfer that skill to other people . &quot; &quot; but i can tell you that absolutely is not happening today .
( applause ) oh , sorry .
they are generated by specific mechanisms that may make them predictable , perhaps controllable .
suddenly , we &apos;re seeing actions on the ground from local government . we &apos;re seeing this mainstreamed .
that would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint .
so i went back there with a 28 mm lens .
and countries with islam as the majority religion , all of them almost had six to seven children per woman , irregardless of the income level .
now , how does the most powerful country in the world handle these displaced people ?
( applause ) i like it . ( applause ) ( laughter ) dl : oh yeah , okay , in my family we had seven girls , four boys , we had two fiddles and one piano , and of course we were all fighting to play on the instruments , so dad and mom set a rule that you couldn &apos;t kick anyone off the instrument . you had to wait until they were finished , so of course , what we would do is we &apos;d get on the piano and you wouldn &apos;t even get off to eat , because you wouldn &apos;t want to give it up to your brother or sister , and they &apos;d wait and wait and wait , and it &apos;d be midnight
and it will cost you upwards of a billion dollars for that one success .
but i had this question .

recording : ♫ daisy , daisy ♫ ♫ give me your answer do ♫ ♫ i &apos;m half crazy ♫ ♫ all for the love of you ♫ ♫ it can &apos;t be a stylish marriage ♫ ♫ i can &apos;t afford a carriage ♫ ♫ but you &apos;ll look sweet upon the seat ♫ ♫ of a bicycle built for two ♫ ak : so james surowieki has this idea of the wisdom of crowds , that says that a whole bunch of people are smarter than any individual .
the computer then talks to a machine — a computer-operated machine , a cad-cam machine — that can make a zillion different changes , at a moment &apos;s notice , because the computer is just a machine .
and the country that does this first will , in my view , leapfrog others in achieving a new economy even , an improved economy , an improved outlook .
let me give you two stats that seem like they &apos;re on opposite ends of the issue , but are actually two sides of the same coin .
so i just said , &quot; &quot; well , if that &apos;s the case , then i &apos;d like to leave . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and it never worked .
( laughter ) well , we would like to encourage all of you to do your part to help protect einstein &apos;s animal friends , and to do your part to help protect their homes that they live &#91; in &#93; .
republicans really dislike the democrats . we &apos;re changing .
state your name and age for the commission .
we all use wikipedia .
what about full knee replacements , from your data , made to measure , where all of the tools and guides are 3d printed ?
and the way i can figure that out is by looking at chunks , sequential chunks of binary information , and i look at the relationships between those chunks .
and i had the pleasure to work on the central plaza .
but it turns out that love is very strictly forbidden in the lower ranks of the guerrilla , so their romance was discovered and they were separated .
and the difference between performance and theater is huge .
and yet two random people will mate and have this child , and both of them have some pretty rotten genes , and the child is likely to come out to be average .
take your skin color , and celebrate it .
that &apos;s no longer the case . logging roads provide access to urban areas .
and it merges the stop sign and yield signs .
because at first i wanted — you know , i &apos;ve taken him on a couple of trips , but i wanted him to see people that live on a dollar a day or less .
bruno giussani : miguel , thank you for sticking to your time .
there are so many things to be happy about .
this is the grand cafe here in oxford .
it &apos;s no money down , and your utility bill decreases .
you &apos;re safe . it &apos;s fine .
earlier this year , with our friends from the imazon nonprofit here in brazil , we launched the first subnational social progress index .
and so i went to both — two race riots , one of which was the los angeles riot . and this next piece is from that .
how ?
take mexico , for example .
it &apos;s not completely gone . i &apos;m going to come back to that .
if you make some noise you can feel the effect .
it &apos;s a giant airbag .
but that all happened later .
it appears that the more secretions she &apos;s got , the more likely the baby is to suckle quickly .
these are the sounds you would expect , but they are also the sounds of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds screeching in the night , the high-pitched honest cries of children and the thunderous , unbearable silence .
they have invented narco-submarines and boats that are not detected by radar .
there &apos;s consequences for carbonate organisms .
but when it comes to our cities and thinking about how death fits in our cities , there &apos;s much less regulation and design and thought than we might imagine .
from regular , relative skydiving i went on to freeflying .
for doing this , i was incarcerated for a year in an assessment center which was actually a remand center . it was a virtual prison for young people .
and i &apos;m not really one for the warm , fuzzy feeling .
they sacrifice fun time . they sacrifice personal indulgence .
we can &apos;t stifle innovation in our business .
it &apos;s not linear . and our intuition is linear .
other creatures can enjoy them too .
this studies the circuitry in two people &apos;s brains that activates while they interact .
and then worked for the jerry brown administration .
my own child , i let that happen to . &quot; &quot; so that &apos;s an investigation of the negative imagination .
i found a couple in the work of matt groening , although matt groening told me later that he could not make my talk because it was a morning session and i gather that he is not an early riser .
she has this show right now at moma , where some of these early works are here on display at moma , on the walls .
but maybe mission blue can fill in that ocean that we can &apos;t see .
what do you think about your movie ?
yeah , the dad was really upset .
when the architects came , they brought us these things , and you &apos;ve probably seen things like this .
and what are the results ?
if we know what that set point is , we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow , and it will be when your challenges are higher than average and skills are higher than average .
so almost all the biology that we observe can be thought of as a series of problems and their corresponding solutions , and the first problem that every organ must solve is a continuous supply of nutrients to fuel all those cells of the body .
it &apos;s one of the largest organizations in the world for young people .
last year , i told you the story , in seven minutes , of project orion , which was this very implausible technology that technically could have worked , but it had this one-year political window where it could have happened .
and yeah , sub-atomic physics is deconstructive . you literally try to tear atoms apart to understand what &apos;s inside of them . but sculpture , from what i understand from great sculptors , is deconstructive , because you see a piece and you remove what doesn &apos;t need to be there .
these cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field , like a screen .
( laughter ) having a little bit of richard time . that &apos;s nice , that &apos;s good .
and those dreams are getting fulfilled .
now , up there , 20 feet above the stage , that &apos;s 10 trillion .
maybe applied for your driver &apos;s license , tried to do your taxes on your own .
so we ask the question again , &quot; &quot; how many straight lines can i draw through the point , but never meet the original line ? &quot; &quot; does someone want to guess ?
good question . there are two main reasons .
and first of all , you have to go with me for a second , and say , you know , you could take the word &quot; &quot; love &quot; &quot; out of a lot of things in our society , put the word &quot; &quot; design &quot; &quot; in , and it still works , like this quote here , you know . it kind of works , you know ?
i was asked last year to give a speech at the oslo freedom forum .
what do we find now ?
i assessed how long they were going to stay and how much it would take to feed them .
or die alone ?
the sound you &apos;re hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close .
now , we &apos;ve all seen a lot of tedtalks online , so let &apos;s watch one now with the sound turned off and the closed captioning turned on .
&#91; &quot; &quot; evict twitter &quot; &quot; &#93; somebody sent me this photo a few weeks ago , and it shows what is happening on the ground in san francisco , and i think you can actually try to understand that through looking at a map like this .
so my favorite visual effect in the movie is the one i &apos;m about to show you .
when you leave the opera house , you &apos;ll find there &apos;s braille signage in the lifts .
okay , you &apos;ve got something ? one more thing .
moving on from this , the next person to explore this field was a gentleman called hans jenny in the 1970s .
i wondered , what work ?
some of what we fear , i suspect , we fear in common .
and unbelievably , in 40 years , i was the first indian to be honored .
i think we should make this even more explicit .
so , that primal medium , which your brain is exquisitely wired for ...
audience : no .
the first one is we &apos;ve targeted the intraspecies communication system .
well , it might look a little bit like the 4,000 community-interest companies that have sprung up in the u.k. over the last five years and a similar rise in b corporations in the united states , enterprises that have ecological and social goals written into their constitution at their heart — companies , in fact , like this one , ecosia .
collaborator : i felt really sad when he died .
in addition , there can be some infectious agents that can also cause autism .
they checked .
design thinking is a process for innovation and problem solving .
&quot; &quot; i recall one patient who was at that point no more than a skeleton encased in shrinking skin , unable to speak , his mouth crusted with candida that was resistant to the usual medications .
they &apos;re good for the environment because they enable no-till farming , which leaves the soil in place , getting healthier from year to year — slso keeps less carbon dioxide going from the soil into the atmosphere .
and so , for example , let &apos;s take jupiter .
if you didn &apos;t , you failed .
she looked at me , and she said , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re exactly the person i need to talk to .
every time a forest is cut down , every time a marsh is filled in , it is a potential lab that goes with it , and which we will never , ever recover .
computers ! what about computers ?
it looks like a horse . it must be a horse .
and yet , the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn &apos;t silent .
they send little pulses of electricity down their processes to each other , and where they contact each other , those little pulses of electricity can jump from one neuron to the other .
why are you fighting so hard not to be yourself ?
don &apos;t create a problem for us , for manufacturing , for application , then we have to buy new companies , we have to buy our competitors , we have to do all kinds of things because you sold too many widgets .
this makes it a remarkably easy and powerful system to use .
there were just 254 left .
he would know what time the sun would rise , and what time it would set .
it &apos;s a space that is playful in its own way , and also purposeful , and in that space , the cartoons are different .
in many parts of sub-saharan africa , the droughts are so much worse .
it &apos;s the romantic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
i kept looking , and i looked at the far end of the town in mountain home , and there was a small trailer park .
what if we put holly into the same context as humans ?
so you say , yeah , well , what are really the chances of this happening ?
( laughter ) and here is our factory in cape town where we make horses .
there were a lot of them .
we have identified over 400 species of bees in pennsylvania .
on the other hand , you &apos;re doing something new , no one &apos;s ever done before , you get it completely wrong . how should you be treated ?
and our new project is having the inmates and ourselves learn how to raise the oregon spotted frog which is a highly endangered amphibian in washington state and oregon .
our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work , they should be able to choose between at least a handful of different cities that were all competing to attract new residents .
i can photograph it from any angle , and it will still look 2d .
but anyway , i think we need to beat them again .
together they grow their own food .
in fact , it was so successful that there &apos;s no way that these days you could make a book like this .
we get to exercise some ancient , ancient drives .
they &apos;ve incurred violent infractions by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners .
and also it takes them forever to act on cells .
this is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine .
i really want to live in a world where disability is not the exception , but the norm .
three-fourths of our oil fuel is transportation .
and he was going to speak at the high school next door to us .
thank you .
we use these things as stopgaps for things that we can &apos;t explain .
let &apos;s do the reflection in x first , followed by the rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise .
we go to magic shows in order to be fooled .
so for example , action unit 12 , it &apos;s not a hollywood blockbuster , it is actually a lip corner pull , which is the main component of a smile .
and what you see are substantial improvements of their immediate memory , of their ability to remember things after a delay , of their ability to control their attention , their language abilities and visual-spatial abilities .
and the wonderful elation that we had when we finally completed it .
now , this suggests that if you could just block waterborne transmission , you could cause disease organisms to shift from the right-hand side of that graph to the left-hand side of the graph .
that eventually we &apos;ll train monkeys to do , or cells or robots , or maybe not even need to do it at all , i was off running the future of the residency program , which is really the future of medicine . &quot; &quot; and they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back .
in africa last year , africans ate 600 million wild animals , and consumed two billion kilograms of bush meat .
unfortunately , empirical data , good , hard stats , don &apos;t exist , and therefore to prove my point , i first of all had to find some proxy way of uncovering how much food was being wasted .
and they kind of took me into the farm and showed me what it was like to live and work .
that &apos;s great , except the places that have malaria really bad , they don &apos;t have health care systems .
and if you &apos;re a fish , and you haven &apos;t gotten your glob in the morning , you &apos;re going to get it in the afternoon , because they &apos;ve got your number .
we are coming out of 50 years , most unusual years , of history in which we have had a totally mono-polar world , in which every compass needle for or against has to be referenced by its position to washington — a world bestrode by a single colossus .
that will blow away a lot of the opposition .
we have charted our love for our child over time .
when you eat healthier , manage stress , exercise and love more , your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen .
and it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question , and it &apos;s extremely hard to answer .
so that people could have something more than just sms ?
the myth of national identity and the vocabulary of coming from confuses us into placing ourselves into mutually exclusive categories .
our enemies shall talk themselves to death , and we will fight them with their own confusion .
this is where gut decisions come from .
we saw geysers coming out .
and for the purposes of this talk , i wanted to isolate just a part of a project that &apos;s even a part of a project that touches a little bit on this theme of architectural special effects , and it happens to be our current obsession , and it plays a little bit with the purging and adding of distraction .
you know , someone sitting next to you in a seat — that &apos;s ok because you &apos;re in a theater , but if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you , you &apos;d freak out .
why is it important to reboot ? what does the red represent ?
so we &apos;d say things like , let &apos;s agree that you &apos;re going to sell 57 widgets per week .
your heart gets more blood flow .
and then i realized i have no idea how we &apos;re going to solve this problem , but i do know one thing : we have got to change the tone of this conversation .
but i think it &apos;s worth the effort , because the alternative , to blindly fight all hackers , is to go against the power you cannot control at the cost of stifling innovation and regulating knowledge .
we &apos;re living in an era of scientific creationism , 9 / 11 conspiracy theories , psychic hotlines , and a resurgence of religious fundamentalism .
governments and civil societies are experimenting with new approaches .
but a place , i think , where the effort is really worthwhile is where people are wrestling with quite serious problems — things like education or security or finance or health .
i was frozen by fear , curled up in the corner of my pitch-black closet clutching my gay grenade , and moving one muscle is the scariest thing i have ever done .
it was a joke .
thank you very much .
so basically , every time we feel that we are on the brink of peace , the conflict explodes again .
it has to do with the favelas , the slums — whatever you call it , there are different names all over the world .
by invisible , i mean it doesn &apos;t absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum .
mom says , &quot; &quot; if they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them , you must always say , &apos; nothing . &apos; and if they insist , say , &apos; whatever you mind to give me . &apos; &quot; &quot; this was the nature of being at that table .
thank you very much .
perhaps the tremendous progress we &apos;ve made over the last century by a series of forces are , in fact , accelerating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of abundance .
so no ego problems .
so i &apos;m very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross-section of my work that i &apos;ve done on the polar regions .
ca : to a lay person it seems like he has certain things to offer the u.s. , the government , you , others , in terms of putting things right and helping figure out a smarter policy , a smarter way forward for the future .
we can understand how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation that was set down 13.72 billion years ago — and yet , we can do calculations today to predict how it will look and it matches .
i guess we could make a glow chicken .
the driving cities in the sun belt , the dallases and the phoenixes and , sorry , atlanta , these cities are not appearing on the list .
in my mind , and in my dreams every night i chagall-man float over the city twirl and swirl with my toes kissing the floor .
there will be stronger storms and greater flooding .
perfect .
but to a liberal , it sounds like this dog is running for the republican nomination .
that sense of hope , we &apos;re going to hold ,
we want to stop that gene from turning on , fusing those hands together , so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand , like the archaeopteryx .
only when women have critical mass in every department at your companies , including building platforms from the ground up , will the conversations about priorities and solutions change .
however , i also think it &apos;s got to do with the fact that bats come out at night , and we don &apos;t really understand them . we &apos;re a little frightened by things that can perceive the world slightly differently than us .
and this is something that a lot of americans want .
( music ) ♫ i don &apos;t understand myself , ♫ ♫ why they keep talking of love , ♫ ♫ if they come near me , ♫ ♫ if they look into my eyes and kiss my hand . ♫ ♫ i don &apos;t understand myself , ♫ ♫ why they talk of magic , ♫ ♫ that no one withstands , ♫ ♫ if he sees me , if he passes by . ♫ ♫ but if the red light is on ♫ ♫ in the middle of the night ♫ ♫ and everybody listens to my song , ♫ ♫ then it is plain to see . ♫ ♫ my lips , they give so fiery a kiss , ♫
inca sculptures are regarded as treasures in british museums , while shakespeare is translated into every major language of the earth .
( applause ) ( boomerang noises ) it was coming straight for me . i had to . it was , yeah .
the truth was my grandfather took me to parades , we had lots of those .
and so what we see , i think , is that small , collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope .
these people don &apos;t mind that i once worked as a singing waitress to help pay for college .
we only get one , and wow , did we ever get a good one .
what release finally , the embrace : though we were wary — it seemed so audacious — how much unspoken joy there was in that affirmation of equality and communion , no matter how much misunderstanding and pain had passed between you by then .
would you like a better system ?
and to remind you that here is an example in which architecture actually did something .
one value of older people is that they are increasingly useful as grandparents for offering high-quality childcare to their grandchildren , if they choose to do it , as more young women enter the workforce and as fewer young parents of either gender stay home as full-time caretakers of their children .
my background should have led me to a different direction .
mr : thank you very much indeed , cynthia kenyon .
but i come to this work after a long history as a social justice activist , and so i &apos;m really interested in the ways that people talk about nonfiction storytelling as though it &apos;s about more than entertainment , as though it &apos;s about being a catalyst for social action .
much of the debate in the u.s. has been about metadata .
that conflict , that tension , will be with us forever , that sometimes it wants to do what it wants to do , and sometimes it &apos;s going to do things for us .
actually , it &apos;s a small manufacturing plant set up by grameen danone , a joint venture between grameen bank of muhammad yunus and the food multinational danone to make high-quality yogurt in bangladesh .
and then back to simplicity again .
that means there &apos;s no waiting for chemical reactions to take place , no need to use reagents that can run out and no need to be an expert to get actionable information .
we &apos;ve heard a lot about what they can and can &apos;t do .
within a year , everybody over 40 was dead .
think about ipods compared to stereos .
read that great piece in the new yorker about how our echo boomers , 19 to 25 , over in iraq taught each other how to do sys admin work , over the internet in chat rooms .
how risky is this ?
what we need are for people to care , to actually go use it , just like they &apos;ve cared enough to use kiva to make those connections .
and then when it &apos;s not using it , it actually can roll it down into its head just like the headlights on your lamborghini .
in that year , we are not available for any of our clients .
they assumed two percent , and that made it a pretty hopeless story , because population growth was two and a half .
and who would talk to terrorists ?
our vice president of operation kissing the board . obviously very , very excited .
and i remember this plan , born out of frustration from a kid who kept calling me &quot; &quot; yogi , &quot; &quot; then pointed at my tummy and said , &quot; &quot; too many picnic baskets . &quot; &quot; turns out it &apos;s not that hard to trick someone , and one day before class , i said , &quot; yeah , you can copy my homework , &quot; and i gave him all the wrong answers that i &apos;d written down the night before .
there are entrepreneurs in the netherlands that produce them , and one of them is here in the audience , marian peeters , who &apos;s in the picture .
so the sweet spot is between 5 and 13 .
he &apos;s going to listen and be really interested .
now , how do i know that i &apos;m right about this somewhat confusing poem ?
people seem to think politics is sexy .
there i would hear people say my father was a &quot; &quot; moudjahid &quot; &quot; and that means &quot; &quot; fighter . &quot; &quot; later on , in france , i loved eavesdropping on grownups &apos; conversations , and i would hear all sorts of stories about my father &apos;s previous life , especially that he had &quot; &quot; done &quot; &quot; world war ii , that he had &quot; &quot; done &quot; &quot; the algerian war .
so as i shake this ketchup bottle , i get some true sensory feedback as the function of time in the bottom row .
but if you don &apos;t need it , and somebody else gives you the shock , it &apos;s not a good thing .
i &apos;ve been simplifying things for 30 years .
we need to take a really positive view .
the brain could only change within certain set limits .
if you have a good wi-fi connection or 3g , this process is very , very quick .
he voted in favor of the bill , in favor of a law that would allow businesses to not serve me .
l-dopa &apos;s a drug , as you know , given for treating parkinson &apos;s disease , which is related to a decrease in dopamine .
you have to take 1,000 pictures per second to see this .
i think you might get a random jumble of letters that looks like this .
my doctor told me that in order to heal my brain , i had to rest it .
unencumbered by clinical responsibilities , unwilling to take no for an answer from those bureaucracies that tend to crush patients , and with an unparalleled ability for information retrieval honed through years of using google .
peter diamandis : probably the most difficult thing that i had to do was raise the capital for this . it was literally impossible .
it &apos;s a business plan for a corporation .
okay , now why then is this curious reluctance and curious hostility to consciousness ?
for example , the psychologist daniel oppenheimer , a few years ago , teamed up with high school teachers .
&quot; please get fisa right . &quot;
and he was working on gyroscopes ; he has a number of patents for that kind of thing .
so , these are early examples in the lab of emerging technologies to digitize fabrication . computers that don &apos;t control tools but computers that are tools , where the output of a program rearranges atoms as well as bits .
and here &apos;s what that means for us .
so very carefully we had to mechanically scrape off all the wax .
tk : that hand &apos;s not so good for clapping .
other ones are kind of going like this . all right .
because what happens in a singly-linked list — this is trying to remove an existing entry from a list — and there &apos;s a difference between if it &apos;s the first entry or whether it &apos;s an entry in the middle .
they were reeling from the earthquake , they were reeling from cholera that was brought in by un peacekeepers and still hasn &apos;t been eradicated .
so here &apos;s an image of red blood cells , and now we can actually map where the hemozoin and where the malaria parasites are inside those red blood cells .
it &apos;s important for us to grow organically .
but he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me to work directly for him in the white house .
it has 300 options , i &apos;m paying for 300 ; i &apos;m using only three but i &apos;m willing to live with it , therefore it is scaling up .
the message reads , &#91; arabic &#93; &quot; you can crush the flowers , but you can &apos;t delay spring . &quot;
all this striving for security , in fact , has made you much more insecure because now you have to watch out all the time .
they were sitting at a table . they were brought together for us .
so , close to 200,000 people a day migrate from the rural to the urban areas .
it &apos;s very ironic .
and i &apos;ve been thinking a lot about what i have learned over these last particularly 11 years with v-day and &quot; &quot; the vagina monologues , &quot; &quot; traveling the world , essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet to stop violence against women .
in fact , when we run the numbers , it looks like it &apos;ll take us at least 15 years before we can fully finance all our conservation efforts .
and i &apos;m only showing you a little bit of this .
thank you frans de waal , wherever you are , i love you and i &apos;d give anything to meet you .
and this is what we spend a lot of our time doing , is just making sure that we can keep up with this kind of traffic load .
and essentially , the oceans are breathing through the southern ocean .
you &apos;re wrong , because it &apos;s the opposite .
the stories of the colonoscopies were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
the only way you can do that is to not swim on top of the water .
the way i look back in the past is by using the fossilized remains of deepwater corals .
and i was getting it all on film and i was recording it , and i was thinking , &quot; &quot; this is it . this is the possibility of it maybe working .
dreams are a form of consciousness on this definition .
so , there &apos;s this guy , right ? victorian era .
and i would like to make a case to you that over the years since we first developed atomic weaponry , until this very moment , we &apos;ve actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world that &apos;s characterized by two phases , which i &apos;m going to go through with you right now .
the first one is harm / care .
jay chiat is a glutton for punishment , and he hired me to do a house for him in the hamptons .
but the bird , instead of flying away , goes flop , flop , flop and lands on my head .
that &apos;s how the system &apos;s supposed to work .
ck : yes , that &apos;s right .
there is different type of barbaria .
and then sort of through a process of wandering around , i got to the thought that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars , in a way that is convenient and affordable , you could get to a solution .
number one : china feels as if it &apos;s been humiliated at the hands of the west through a hundred years of history , beginning with the opium wars .
don &apos;t be daunted . just do your job .
i started a foundation to bet on these good people doing good things .
( laughter ) &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve misjudged this women , &quot; &quot; thought mr. dickens .
but what i want to point out is you can buy this from itunes .
you &apos;re going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so , i gave myself the job title of ted custodian for a reason , and i will promise you right here and now that the core values that make ted special are not going to be interfered with .
he was trying to tell people how they should live through the medium of sermons , the classic medium of delivery of religions .
and there &apos;s evan .
and so i &apos;ll just go get them .
and sometimes it &apos;s about a legacy of the neighborhood , like in morrisania , about the jazz history .
so when i went through the data , i had very surprising results , because i found that four out of the five marinating ingredients actually inhibited the carcinogen formation .
how many inventors and untold entrepreneurs live out this phenomenon ?
and fundamentally , it &apos;s a story about how starting as very small children and continuing out all the way to the greatest accomplishments of our culture , we get the world right .
i don &apos;t see anybody actually being able to do that very effectively .
what i &apos;m showing you again here is this map of the human microbiome project data , so each point represents a sample from one body site from one of 250 healthy adults .
i recognize the pain they caused to others , for which there can be no forgiveness , but the pain they caused to me , there is , &quot; &quot; she said .
and if not , can you make yourself smart again ?
those girls have never touched google .
today i want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have , which is the choice overload problem .
and afghanistan , afghanistan , we think has probably stopped polio repeatedly .
eh : not bad .
we don &apos;t know how far it will go , but it &apos;s going on .
he had a bold idea that — what he called the cognitive trade-off hypothesis .
so here &apos;s the situation .
i like the idea of collaboration with people like that because it pushes you .
we are policing the world , and how are we doing that ?
bob dylan is 23 years old , and his career is just reaching its pinnacle .
war and malnutrition kills people together with hope .
and the reason it does is not because of the clever encryption .
now , i know what you &apos;re thinking .
( laughter ) yeah .
ok , that &apos;s fair enough .
the next bit , we &apos;d chartered a pretty elderly russian plane to fly us up to a town called khatanga , which was the sort of last bit of civilization .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve had these people approach you before .
i have faith , for instance , that peace in the middle east is possible despite the ever-accumulating mass of evidence to the contrary .
so how we use yeast in the future is going to be really interesting .
so these are a couple of instrumentalists .
everest is an extreme environment .
that &apos;s what the experience of the last 20 years has been .
on the other end of the spectrum , some were so sick they had to live in complete darkness , unable to tolerate the sound of a human voice or the touch of a loved one .
maybe some of you have received an email that says something like , &quot; &quot; hi , i &apos;m a nigerian banker , and i &apos;d like to give you 53 billion dollars because i like your face . &quot; &quot; or funnycats.exe , which rumor has it was quite successful in china &apos;s recent campaign against america .
if someone was to throw an egg at the sistine chapel , we &apos;d all go crazy .
( music ) and so they &apos;re beautiful , but this libertarian has some important lessons he wants us to learn from this .
and so we prospered in a way that no other animal has .
and it didn &apos;t stop there .
so after i returned home , i received word that one member of the family had been shot 30 times in the face .
and then we took these flies and allowed them to make choices .
but in this country , where the government apparently does not feel compelled to provide health care for citizens , ( laughter ) we &apos;ve taken a very different approach .
all four of my oars broke before i reached halfway across .
hello ?
but this one is — the bible says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month , and more than that , you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat .
so , why is that ?
it may just take the right crazy idea .
so in this image , what you can see is that everything smaller than five nanometers is going from the blood , through the kidney , into the urine , and everything else that &apos;s bigger is retained .
( audience : random . ) michael sandel : at random . you would do it by lottery .
but when you get specific , when you actually ask about the actual taxing and spending issues under consideration , people are remarkably centrist , they &apos;re remarkably open to compromise .
so every second , half of the library of congress is swooshing around in this machine . it &apos;s a big machine .
and you all know that if you are going to determine whether you &apos;re related to your brother or your sister , you can &apos;t do it by looking at differences .
now , technology has changed a lot since the victrola days .
so with all these theatric elements , this pushes me in another role , and that would be , possibly , the dramaturge .
we &apos;ve discovered things like , for example , rna interference only a few years ago , and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work .
so let &apos;s make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana .
just think of sebastian and how he bought the cat to influence his .
the person i believed for half of my life to have superpowers suddenly needed help to get dressed or to cut food .
the good news is i &apos;m very aware of my responsibilities to get you out of here because i &apos;m the only thing standing between you and the bar .
not enough to stabilize the climate .
who &apos;s not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings — if you &apos;re different from all the other beings ?
and then you &apos;d see an image of britney spears to remind you of this funny anecdote you want to tell .
take the planet venus .
( music ) but basically , it &apos;s just a b , with four sads .
( laughter ) so , i took a look at my life , a hard look at my life , and i saw some things very disturbing . ( laughter )
and i don &apos;t mean the whole economy , because to grow an economy of india to the size of u.k. — that &apos;s a piece of cake , with one billion people .
on the other side , there is this girl .
and some people think that &apos;s a good thing .
right ? and then i realized , that was on my website , and then it said , like , you know , the quote was attributed to me and i thought , oh , i said something , you know , in an interview .
it &apos;s got a remarkably clear yes / no answer , and just requires phenomenal grunt .
i hope that you will take a look at it .
( laughter ) but , you know , i could pop a book on in the middle of the night , and — ( laughter ) ( applause ) now , the kurzweil reader is simply a program on my laptop .
they would not leave me alone until i let them have a piece , but it was not a good one . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) well , it occurred to me that i should invite dr. robicsek to lecture at wofford college on — what else ?
education is often of poor quality .
and if they &apos;re on a smartphone on google , they &apos;ve got access to more knowledge and information than president clinton did 15 years ago .
&quot; &quot; strange , &quot; &quot; he agreed .
i &apos;m excited when i glimpse that kind of thinking writ large .
i &apos;m a historian by training , and what i study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy — meaning human bodies , animal bodies — how they dealt with bodily fluids , concepts of bodies ; how have they thought about bodies .
however , i longed to share my life with someone .
but yes there are some solutions .
and when this story posted , i ran to my computer to send it to the imf official .
yeah , you all have a body , right ?
it stayed here and tried not to move any part of its body .
next is maynard sipes .
guys , we have an issue .
if you look at birds , which live a long time , cells from the birds tend to be more resistant to a lot of different environmental stresses like high temperature or hydrogen peroxide , things like that .
and that begins to lift a heavy burden off the world &apos;s poor .
here &apos;s another case that i think is interesting .
what has changed our society has been wireless devices .
how important is this ?
it means that you have to save more today .
i don &apos;t quite mean that the golden rule itself is written in our genes , but you can go to a hunter gatherer society that has had no exposure to any of the great religious traditions , no exposure to ethical philosophy , and you &apos;ll find , if you spend time with these people , that , basically , they believe that one good turn deserves another , and that bad deeds should be punished .
he came up with our name and logo . we &apos;re mission motors .
now , years ago , when i was working at youtube , we were looking for ways to encourage more people to rate videos , and it was interesting because when we looked into the data , we found that almost everyone was exclusively using the highest five-star rating , a handful of people were using the lowest one-star , and virtually no one was using two , three or four stars .
i made a promise that the next time i would fly around the world , it would be with no fuel , independent from fossil energies , in order to be safe , not to be threatened by the fuel gauge .
if you remember what i told you about fls at the beginning , it &apos;s knowledge and skills .
( laughter ) okay . okay . oh , well .
now , in the 20th century we had a revolution that was initiated at the beginning of the 20th century , and which is still going on .
and i don &apos;t think that we should give up on beauty .
why don &apos;t we take it a little longer — maybe two hours instead of an hour — and have less of this intensity ? &quot; &quot; and the nurses told me two things .
how well are we doing determining what piece to move where ?
they just thought , &quot; &quot; well , we &apos;ll give a course of 10 .
and no tricky shit behind the thing . i mean , it &apos;s all — you &apos;ve got to be very honest with what you &apos;re doing if it really is going to work .
the idea is that the building blocks of the digital economy are connectivity and entrepreneurship .
and i think we probably do need to pay some more attention to that , because it &apos;s actually kind of fragile .
and at seven o &apos;clock every night , i took me some more girls , already corrupted .
they have learned their lesson . they will control .
( applause )
nl : i am the peer of whoever i &apos;m talking to .
thank you .
unfortunately , i don &apos;t fly trans-atlantic business class often enough to know , or any other kind of business class really , but i assume that in business class , you don &apos;t hear many expressions of , you know , bigotry about racial groups or ethnic groups , because the people who are flying trans-atlantic business class are doing business with all these people ; they &apos;re making money off all these people . and i really do think that , in that sense at least , capitalism has been a constructive force , and more fundamentally , it &apos;s a non-zero-sumness that has been a constructive force in expanding people &apos;s realm of moral awareness . i think the non-zero-sum dynamic ,
sometimes i can stand before the world — and when i say this , transformation is a difficult and slow process — sometimes i can stand before the world and say , &quot; &quot; my name is chris abani .
ok , so , confession : i &apos;ve always been weirdly obsessed with advertising .
and different people will have different places they want it set .
so this is a picture of me holding one of the first watercolor paintings i ever made .
men have sex before marriage , and people more or less turn a blind eye .
in fact , nothing expresses that assumption more clearly than three simple numbers : 9-1-1 , which , of course , is the number for the emergency police operator here in canada and in the united states , where the average response time to a police 911 emergency call is about 10 minutes .
but the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first .
tbl : can you say &quot; &quot; now &quot; &quot; ?
as an absolute connection , it only works one way .
and on the other end of the spectrum , this is a microstructure .
( laughter ) and when she saw him , he was down on one knee , he had the ring out .
now we can take the words and start to build sentences out of them .
but then he decides , &quot; let me tweak my tactics a little bit . &quot;
so this is a plate of nachos .
there &apos;s something that it feels like to drink beer which is not what it feels like to do your income tax or listen to music , and this qualitative feel automatically generates a third feature , namely , conscious states are by definition subjective in the sense that they only exist as experienced by some human or animal subject , some self that experiences them .
they &apos;re all searching for their staircase .
office worker : got a ham and swiss on rye ? bm : no .
so i don &apos;t know , it started to become an interesting mix .
you degrade forests , you go beyond the boundary on land , you undermine the ability of the climate system to stay stable .
i pushed back .
if you really want great hamburger , it turns out it makes a difference if you align the grain .
it would have the interdisciplinarity of the ted conference .
that &apos;s one of the themes that sylvia reminds us about : understand this ocean of ours , this basic life support system , the dominant life support system on the planet .
and we &apos;d sing this old song . she didn &apos;t have a whole lot of energy , so i &apos;d sing , &quot; &quot; hey , hey ! &quot; &quot; and she &apos;d just answer back with , &quot; &quot; black-eyed susie . &quot; &quot; oh , hey , hey , black-eyed susie ! hey , hey , black-eyed susie !
and fortunately , in the course of this project , the transplant surgeons and the other people decided , forget common practice . we have to switch .
( laughter ) so in the studio , rather than drawing , we began to learn how to knit .
there is some modeling of ecosystems going on now .
and from , you know , fattushis , to taxistan to , you know , for the fashtoonks , botoxia , pashmina , khlintunisia , you know , we were able to take the city and make fun of this completely foreign , who are — what &apos;s going on over here ?
this is why i can wear my gho with pride .
but then i thought , oh , i &apos;m sending myself mixed messages .
maybe we don &apos;t recognize it every time , but we understand that it happens .
i do dream in x-ray . i see my projects in my sleep .
and this is just a very simple way of understanding what kind of innovation , what kind of different design we need .
literally hundreds of elevator rides were spent with me alone stuffing the pump into my spanx , hoping the doors wouldn &apos;t open unexpectedly .
and what hotel means , in kenya and india , is an eating-place .
( applause )
talk to any astrophysicist .
as you get towards the 1970s , things are going to start to change .
some of them were toys . some of them were candy .
and if you don &apos;t know them , that &apos;s okay . most casual players probably do .
from my american perspective , when a paying customer makes a reasonable request based on her preferences , she has every right to have that request met .
it &apos;s just a question to use some techniques like the time lapse .
i know most people don &apos;t see it that way .
food can be there and people can &apos;t buy it .
jihad may at times take the form of fighting , but only sometimes , under strict conditions , within rules and limits .
take , for example , the incidents of suicide baiting .
here &apos;s another one . bang .
he went into a coma .
so there &apos;s some that are all about the toast , and all about the transformation of toast .
it took me weeks of internal thinking to try to reconcile the good reasons we had to assist that family and the soldier of fortune he became .
and it seemed like time that we become that way ourselves .
well , i thought there would be a podium , so i &apos;m a bit scared .
and in that sense , ballooning is a beautiful metaphor .
should i take vitamin c ? should i be taking wheatgrass ?
we hired a team of physicists , software engineers and biologists to work on this , and the first thing we had to work on was to create the human body , basically .
my story begins right here actually in rajasthan about two years ago .
just a few examples : an artist who paints with fluorescent physarum ; a collaborative team who are combining biological and electronic design with 3d printing technologies in a workshop ; another artist who is using the slime mold as a way of engaging a community to map their area .
but in fact , in a few years , organizations will know so much about us , they will be able to infer our desires before we even form them , and perhaps buy products on our behalf before we even know we need them .
i have to say , these are very hybrid places .
we were spending so much time with this leopard and getting to understand her individualism , her personal character , that maybe we were taking it a little bit far .
and just to give you a flavor of how well this works , this is the result we get when we analyze this for some familiar words .
what &apos;s missing ? what would i like to know ?
this is bringing together international — there are 50 nations involved in this mission — interagency — these development agencies — and private-public , to take on this kind of security .
the scientific embargo — if it &apos;s ever submitted to &quot; &quot; nature , &quot; &quot; hopefully , it will be accepted .
i &apos;m a member of the blackfeet nation .
it &apos;s a satellite that goes into space , which is probably the least open-source thing you can imagine , and it contains an arduino connected to a bunch of sensors . so if you know how to use arduino , you can actually upload your experiments into this satellite and run them .
they &apos;ve been bombed by the military , they &apos;ve been besieged , they &apos;ve been stormed by isis and they &apos;ve been cut off from supplies for years .
it &apos;s about the same as yours and mine .
i think , if you live with your head in the clouds every now and then , it helps you keep your feet on the ground .
let &apos;s look at the pantheon and the piazza della rotonda in front of it .
i &apos;ve been building topsoil .
you &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; aha , but new zealand has a higher gdp than chad ! &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a good point , well made .
i was a new mother and a young rabbi in the spring of 2004 and the world was in shambles .
so the country in the world with the highest social progress , the number one country on social progress is new zealand .
when did we originate as a species ?
so the 20th century , then , saw how much more complex reality was , but it also saw a positive side .
they couldn &apos;t hear what i was saying in the context of a 10 back-to-back powerpoint presentation conference .
soon , you &apos;ll be able to look inside your brain and program , control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there .
and i &apos;m not talking about all comedy here , because , clearly , there &apos;s plenty of humor that colors safely within the lines of what we already think and feel .
now we &apos;ve got the data , plus we have metadata .
you &apos;ve gone through hundreds of tv channels , just switching channel after channel , and then suddenly you actually stop on one .
i have won a lot of awards through this work .
leandro started a campaign using one of our tools , the pressure cooker , the same one that bia and jovita used , and the state government changed their minds before christmas eve .
so what you do one day is you take a pile of arrowheads , and you walk up to the one that can &apos;t speak very well , and you put the arrowheads down in front of him , hoping that he &apos;ll get the idea that you want to trade your arrowheads for finished arrows .
there &apos;s also a huge emotional impact .
rb : yeah , as it turned out , it proved to be the right move .
well , you know , sometimes the most important things come in the smallest packages .
the important question is , &quot; &quot; is it interesting ? &quot; &quot; and i follow this question , not worrying about &quot; &quot; is it music ? &quot; &quot; — not worrying about the definition of the thing that i &apos;m making .
then you can look at the ratios of those numbers , and figure out for a data center where you don &apos;t have that information , you can figure out , but maybe you only have one of those , you know the square footage , then you could figure out well , maybe the power is proportional .
in contrast , they will walk an extra mile to avoid people who are not having fun .
i received a poignant tweet .
well , we &apos;ve seen that that can &apos;t be true .
on the other , the non-u.s.-related threats out of those 54 , the other 42 of them , the prism program was hugely relevant to that , and in fact was material in contributing to stopping those attacks .
and she looked at me , and she said , &quot; &quot; but , aimee , that &apos;s not fair . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) ( applause ) and the incredible thing was she really meant it .
jb : it &apos;s so powerful . richard ford , who &apos;s won the pulitzer prize , says that dyslexia helped him write sentences .
it made it possible for us to take close-up pictures of people 100 kilomteres away , like this one . ( laughter ) people called us and asked , how is this man doing ?
and they &apos;re coming into the city by rail .
now i &apos;m going to play the burst for you .
from &apos; 83 to &apos; 95 : two percent per annum .
so if we had some way to stop this scaling — and so i picked up some shells on the beach . and i asked them , what is scaling ? what &apos;s inside your pipes ?
this is all done in between the ribs .
it &apos;s just love . that &apos;s all it is .
so we &apos;ve developed certain tactics and strategies to cover up .
the paper you &apos;re holding in your hand contains the details of iraqi civilians that died as result of the invasion .
thus 900,000 people either have died or have significant damage to their heart muscle .
and she makes them so they could either be broken up into payments , or they could be like these , which are leaves that can be payments .
pretty quickly i saw that if you had more than a few values you &apos;d never remember on the screen where things were .
for me , the design exercise always begins here with the periodic table , enunciated by another professor , dimitri mendeleyev .
because even through the squeaks of his hearing aids , his understanding of music was profound .
in june 2010 , internet changed my life forever .
and i says , &quot; &quot; well , try me . &quot; &quot; and then he said , &quot; &quot; but i don &apos;t believe that you can do this . &quot; &quot; so i said , &quot; &quot; ok . &quot; &quot; so , to cut a long story short , i went home , went underneath the microscope , and i crushed up a piece of glass , crushed it up .
the next moment , as soon as they finished and disappeared into the shadows , a young man with a propane lantern came on , hung it up on a tree , set up a curtain .
now , these ideas and these events allow us even to deconstruct iconic places that many of you have been to , like machu picchu .
i could feel the wind against my face and the beat of my racing heart as if it were happening in that very moment .
and maybe something else .
now , the balance that i try to fight for , i , as any good liberal , try to fight for first by looking to the government . total mistake , right ?
instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem , design the solution around what the human will do as well .
these legs that i was on , which i &apos;ll take out right now — i was the first person in the world on these legs .
i &apos;ll just take you to bangladesh for a minute .
the computer was cracked open .
and that means because we went into iraq , we should stay there until things were solved . you know , maybe even 100 years .
there are other avenues of technology that criminals can exploit .
and that imperfect , chaotic , turbulent surface is what told the story .
and basically , one of these groups will kind of back off and everything will resolve fine , and it doesn &apos;t really escalate into violence too much .
aidg has worked in haiti since 2007 , providing engineering and business support to small businesses .
instead , the dog says , &quot; &quot; i know that tone . i know that tone .
and that &apos;s how i &apos;ll use my 100,000-dollar prize money .
we do not use any electrons that come from coal .
this is a thumb claw . there it was , moments after it was discovered .
if we flip this around , we can create a resource that can solve so many of our other problems .
new york , new jersey and california have been dropping their prison populations , closing prisons , while also seeing a big drop in crime .
paleoecology , the study of past ecosystems , crucial to an understanding of our own , feels like a portal through which you may pass into an enchanted kingdom .
and you can get an intuitive appreciation for this if you imagine just the people at the perimeter of the network .
and counting off by four ?
i also wanted to paint the highlights and create a mapping on his body in greyscale .
they spend an awful lot on buying back their stock , which is quite problematic .
it was more like , &quot; &quot; look , i &apos;ve been working on this for half a year , i &apos;d love to have comments . &quot; &quot; and other people approached me .
politicians also need to learn , occasionally , to say that certain things that voters want , certain things that voters have been promised , may be things that we cannot deliver or perhaps that we feel we should not deliver .
and if you compare this to the microbes in a different air handling unit , you &apos;ll see that they &apos;re fundamentally different .
now , if you think about that , peacekeepers being trained on top of bodies .
( laughter ) when i first came to america , i used to try this with employees as well and they kind of — they have these different rules over here , it &apos;s very strange .
and you &apos;ve been shuffling down long corridors , past statues , frescoes , lots and lots of stuff .

a second argument would be : because it was sitting on a stove with the flame on — that &apos;s an historical argument .
( sighs ) ( laughter ) ze frank : oh ! amazing . ( laughter )

you have to cut it out , bring it back home , cut it up , look inside and say , &quot; &quot; oh yes , it does have gas . &quot; &quot; so that takes more time .
how do we think about complex systems in new ways ?
and it &apos;s not just caterers , it &apos;s hoteliers , it &apos;s retailers , it &apos;s anyone who provides services to the public or businesses .
it &apos;s kind of like a new approach to desktop computing .
so this thing right here is freaking me out .
one of their leaders was killed in pakistan recently .
what &apos;s code , what &apos;s hardware ?
( applause )
a desperate plea to doctors to take pain seriously in patients &apos; lives .
i deserve the education that i get here .
they &apos;re using &quot; &quot; lean in &quot; &quot; to help people make the transition back to what would be a fair life , really rescuing them from their pimps , and using it .

you say where you &apos;re from , and i say , &quot; &quot; oh , yeah . &quot; &quot; or your alma mater or your job , and i know just a little something about it , enough to get the ball rolling .
create a space for an office , a space of sustainability that really works between that virtuality and yet can be realized as something real .
just finally , this is only just the beginning .
we sort out the proteins — from left to right is the weight of the fragments that we &apos;re getting , and from top to bottom is how slippery they are .

and again , i say that not to attack any industry , i think — i really do — i love my airplane , and cars on highways moving 60 miles an hour are extraordinarily efficient , both from an engineering point of view , an energy consumption point of view , and a utility point of view .
now to many commentators , cumulative cultural adaptation , or social learning , is job done , end of story .
there was a great ted moment , i think it was sir ken robinson , was it ?
we just did some pasting in los angeles on another project in the last weeks .
but images don &apos;t need to be graphic in order to remind us of the tragedy of war .
sorceress , tranced , ecstatic , stock-still on the sidewalk ragged coat hanging agape , passersby flowing around her , her mouth torn suddenly open as though in a scream , silently though , as though only in her brain or breast had it erupted .
everything in my room was shaking — my heart , my windows , my bed , everything .
getting over our fear of riding bikes . making our beds .

and when we first heard this result inside the foundation , i have to admit , bill and i were scratching our heads a little bit and we were saying , &quot; &quot; but who &apos;s going to volunteer for this procedure ? &quot; &quot; but it turns out the men do , because they &apos;re hearing from their girlfriends that they prefer it , and the men also believe it improves their sex life .

they were creating subsidies either for large farms , or they were giving inputs to the farmers that they thought they should use , rather than that the farmers wanted to use .
all they have , really , is trademark protection , and so it means that anybody could copy any garment on any person in this room and sell it as their own design .
so this , i &apos;m happy to say , it took three years to produce this because we also finalized the draft and took it actually into the field , sat with the election commissions in all these different countries , debated and defined and refined the draft , and finally published it in november 2014 in cairo .

twenty years later , criminals are still using mobile phones , but they &apos;re also building their own mobile phone networks , like this one , which has been deployed in all 31 states of mexico by the narcos .
we looked at skyscraper construction , we looked at the aviation world , and we found that they have technology , they have training , and then they have one other thing : they have checklists .

this improved science and engineering will , whether we like it or not , give us more and more leverage to affect the planet , to control the planet , to give us weather and climate control — not because we plan it , not because we want it , just because science delivers it to us bit by bit , with better knowledge of the way the system works and better engineering tools to effect it .
in science , the exact opposite is the case : march away from the sound of the guns .
this is back in 1964 , when the technical managers have suits and ties and nrk rolled all its equipment on board a ship , and 200 meters out of the shore , transmitting the signal back , and in the machine room , they talked to the machine guy , and on the deck , they have splendid entertainment .

a health status of a nation parallels development of that nation .
sb : well , research on progeria has come so far in less than 15 years , and that just shows the drive that researchers can have to get this far , and it really means a lot to myself and other kids with progeria , and it shows that if that drive exists , anybody can cure any disease , and hopefully progeria can be cured in the near future , and so we can eliminate those 4,000 diseases that francis was talking about .
in the 20th century , it was totalitarianism .

so , i changed it so that every season was different , and i continued to do these posters , but they never had the seriousness of the first identity because they were too individual , and they didn &apos;t have that heft of everything being the same thing .
a random stranger walked past , looked at me and he smiled .
there was no day when humanity came together , separate in all of those things and just shared it together — that we &apos;re in this together , and that if we united and we interculturally cooperated , then that might be the key to humanity &apos;s survival .

and the essex study which has just been done in the u.k. , which incidentally showed that when you do this , you do not just make a room that &apos;s suitable for hearing-impaired children , you make a room where behavior improves , and results improve significantly , this found that sending a child out of area to a school that does have such a room , if you don &apos;t have one , costs 90,000 pounds a year .

ushahidi — the name means &quot; &quot; witness &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; testimony &quot; &quot; in swahili — is a very simple way of taking reports from the field , whether it &apos;s from the web or , critically , via mobile phones and sms , aggregating it and putting it on a map .
they wrote software to stabilize — even though they were on a bus and maybe someone &apos;s holding their phone at an angle — to stabilize the phone , process it , and you may know on your smartphone , when you type a password , the keys pop out a little bit , and they were able to use that to reconstruct what the person was typing , and had a language model for detecting typing .

the idea interested me ; i tried to find out what that was and i found out that there was a campaign for the simplification of language , which was the &quot; &quot; plain english campaign &quot; &quot; .
( laughter ) but he really listens — because that &apos;s all we need — i &apos;ll show you a guy who &apos;s done a lot of work .
i want you all to imagine rio .
now i have spoken my last words , and i don &apos;t even remember for sure what they were .
the stellar parallax therefore , is very small and actually very hard to detect .

the average depths are about 12,000 ft .
i talk against violence , against terrorism .
i have young filmmakers come up to me and say , &quot; &quot; give me some advice for doing this . &quot; &quot; and i say , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t put limitations on yourself .
so the fiscal cliff , i was told that that &apos;s too partisan a thing to say , although i can &apos;t remember which party it &apos;s supporting or attacking .
that &apos;s not insignificant .
i mean , is it crazy to think that this girl , in the back , at the right , in 15 years , might be sharing the idea that keeps the world beautiful for your grandchildren ?

i just did something i &apos;ve never done before .
my name is harry baker . harry baker is my name .
in a sibling society , there &apos;s lots of things .
we have to crawl that with our attentional systems .

now , you may be wondering , how did this guy become great without doing a whole lot ?
they didn &apos;t make loans and then sell the loans .
i think there is almost no limit to what we can accomplish if we are radically open and we don &apos;t care who gets the credit .
i was amazed .
we pay a price for that , but we are aware of it , and generally we will pay the price for increased freedoms , choices and opportunities .
the other one is the information assurance mission , which is to protect the national security systems of the united states , and by that , that &apos;s things like the communications that the president uses , the communications that control our nuclear weapons , the communications that our military uses around the world , and the communications that we use with our allies , and that some of our allies themselves use .
until now , these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice .
the cost of sequencing the human genome is dropping precipitously .
and he clicks the &quot; &quot; buy now &quot; &quot; button .
you can find this on youtube , the gentleman who &apos;s recumbent on a motorcycle while text messaging .
now , when you &apos;re an investigative reporter and you make an amazing discovery , such as your prime minster can be linked to a secret offshore company , that that company has a financial interest in icelandic banks — the very issue he &apos;s been elected on — well , your instinct is to scream out very loud .
it looks as if these different public services work together to create some nice little compositions .
this would be someone who &apos;s entirely intuitive .
i want to say , &quot; &quot; computer , let &apos;s design a car , &quot; &quot; and the computer shows me a car .
so , a patient can come in and actually blow into their device .
i mean kgb , and not just kgb , used to torture in order to actually get this data .
thank you .
then you can of course always go and see this guy .
it &apos;s the coolest stuff .
now , why would neuroscientists say that we don &apos;t just construct , we reconstruct ?
but some day , some day , maybe it &apos;s going to work .
so netra was stuck with 30 paintings of mine .
you see how resistant it is to those very ideas .
we can see them indirectly , because black holes wreak havoc on their environment .
she looked at me and i looked at her .
which means , are you preserving what you are doing for future use or for future generations ?
well it starts from a very basic premise : of course , there &apos;s no god .
and those are all things that women do very well .
but the point , what i &apos;ve got it down to , is there are only two questions really worth asking .
so i &apos;m not saying that you should plant a meadow of pot , but a pot in a meadow .
but all our fabrication is down in this lower left corner .
and what a perfect place to do that , at ted .

and we did a lot of media work , also a lot of experimental theater projects .
my husband read it and he was like , this is like eating your wheaties . ( laughter ) no one — and i apologize to wheaties if there &apos;s someone — no one , no one will read this book .
we &apos;ve seen this story all over the country and even in places beyond the american borders .
now , let &apos;s imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo , and the dealer near your house had it for 31,000 .
and when they eat the seeds , their foie gras turns yellow .
( applause ) so my penchant for hugging other people has earned me the nickname dr. love .
one on the extreme right is a photograph of an american footballer .
if we do more in a kind of a stupid way , the simplicity gets complex and , in fact , we can keep on doing it for a very long time .
and all of the muslim majority countries across the income are coming down , as do the christian majority countries in the middle income range .
a few energy geeks spread out across the room .
now , it &apos;s interesting , because we &apos;ve embraced this darwinian view of a continuity in physical evolution , this physical continuity .
but at least it &apos;s just a kind of artwork to explore our ideas about a different future .
in the remaining time , i &apos;d like to tell you two features of them .
thank you very much .
now i have learned that my place is not just in the west or in africa , and i &apos;m still searching for my identity , but i saw ghana create democracy better .

i want to fix our education system .
there is recovery .
i will not let silence wrap itself around my indecision .
and the appliances , the golden age of appliances really lasted — it depends how you want to measure it — but it &apos;s anywhere from 40 to 60 years . it goes on a long time .
compare this to normal infrastructure investments .
and shortly after , we left the country , and we returned to switzerland .
pick up just one marker , pick up just one marker , and why don &apos;t you color in the horse for me ?
you see , i don &apos;t work with prestige , so always do mistakes .
( laughter ) ( applause ) this is grace dammann .
the hate mail i get is unbelievable .
and jackson pollock also .
they happened at the conference table at the weekly lab meeting , when everybody got together and shared their kind of latest data and findings , oftentimes when people shared the mistakes they were having , the error , the noise in the signal they were discovering .
biological nutrition can supply about 500 million humans , which means that if we all wore birkenstocks and cotton , the world would run out of cork and dry up .
it needs to come from farming .
robot : oh , cool .
so , this is what a new map of the world looks like .
could we change the way that wealth gets created in the first place by democratizing wealth creation , engaging more people in the economy , and then ensuring that they got fair compensation ?
it &apos;s like &quot; &quot; last call for alcohol , &quot; &quot; right ?
let &apos;s see what happens . this experiment &apos;s been done many , many times .
people seem to think , now equate religious faith with believing things .
what you could do is really influence your product now and shape-manipulate your product .
so , how we eradicated smallpox was — mass vaccination wouldn &apos;t work .
so , it &apos;s a new way of thinking about cancer , it &apos;s a hopeful way of thinking about cancer .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
( applause ) the other thing that i have realized , that the woman is the most strong person all over the world .

he does not seem to be breathing .
so what this means now is that those traits we then look at and so readily see — facial features , skin color , hair structure — are not determined by single genes with big effects , but are determined by many different genetic variants that seem to vary in frequency between different parts of the world .
particularly , there &apos;s a place called europa , which is — europa is one of the moons of jupiter , where we see a very level ice surface , which looks as if it &apos;s floating on top of an ocean .
it &apos;s really amazing .
for example , you could create a rod that can easily be placed inside water bottles for individual use or you could create a porous filter that can filter water for families .
circle has got this very simple system that underpins it , enables a small local team to support a membership of up to a thousand .
the spirit of these labs , it &apos;s open , it &apos;s positive , but , you know , sometimes when people think of us , the first thing that comes to mind is bio-safety , bio-security , all the dark side stuff .
and when these four cells work together in health and harmony , they create an extraordinary symphony of electrical activity , and it is this electrical activity that underpins our ability to think , to emote , to remember , to learn , move , feel and so on .
these are the two main sort of binary oppositions within the logic of copyright law .
the filmmaker mira nair speaks about growing up in a small town in india . its name is bhubaneswar , and here &apos;s a picture of one of the temples in her town .
but the thing that struck me is , one guy said in exasperation , a very famous neurobiologist , he said , &quot; &quot; look , in my discipline it &apos;s okay to be interested in consciousness , but get tenure first . get tenure first . &quot; &quot; now i &apos;ve been working on this for a long time .
and in terms of the line of poetry , why does the poet use the word hare rather than rabbit ?
and so , the question i raised before becomes even more interesting if you thought about the enormity of this in every one of your bodies .
well , in kenya it was taking 72 days for a business owner to register their property , compared to just one day in new zealand , which was ranked second on the world bank list .
there are very industrious experiments being built on earth — one called ligo — which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers .
out of a list of 26 topics , salary is only number eight .
we &apos;ve taken this information and we &apos;ve made a mathematical model out of it .
and myth says that he had an audience with the oracle , and it foretold his destiny of greatness .
as a journalist , i think these stories of what people in power do when no one is watching , are precisely the stories that we need to tell .
and not only that , i am documenting it — documenting my own cultural shortcomings .
but i took a liking to them because they dwell on the fringes of society .
so i thought this morning i would try to be the optimist , and give reason to hope for the future of the internet by drawing upon its present .
something amazing happened during this shoot .
now here &apos;s the even more striking thing .
so 100 years ago , hormones had just been discovered , and people hoped that hormone treatments were going to cure aging and disease , and now instead we set our hopes on stem cells , genetic engineering , and nanotechnology .
oncosearch was a good example .
so think about it .
ok , so as a matter of fact , child number one is telling the truth , child number two is lying .
i was gaunt . i walked as though my legs were wooden .
in fact , we call first year science and engineering , typically around america , weed-out courses or barrier courses .
so as soon as i see a question about things i &apos;m afraid of , which might be earthquakes , other religions , maybe i &apos;m afraid of terrorists or sharks , anything that makes me feel , assume you &apos;re going to exaggerate the problem .
and we &apos;ll wind in the target .
peter drucker , one of the greatest management consultants in history , died age 96 , a few years ago .
carmen agra deedy : all right , then you know that you have now entered parking lot purgatory , praying to that saint of perpetual availability that as you join that serpentine line of cars crawling along , some guy &apos;s going to turn on the brake lights just as you pull up behind him .
to deal with contradictions , for example , they add branching patterns and parallel patterns .
it should imagine a user .
and i found myself in front of an hr manager in 1999 , saying something i never imagined that i would say .
and you can map the exact pathways when a mouse sees , feels , touches , remembers , loves .
wk : yeah .
you basically need intelligence , you need an ability to sit still and focus , to communicate openly , to be able to listen to people and to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be , and those are things that women do extremely well , as we &apos;re seeing .
so for each person we can establish an average , which is the center of the diagram .
i mean , this is what is happening inside your brain .
yes ? zoe : yeah .
diplomacy needs to be well resourced , sustained , and apply the right mix of incentives and pressures on leaders and followers .
finally , in robotic motion planning , there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to take advantage of abilities of robots to maximize future freedom of action in order to accomplish complex tasks .
so i asked for people &apos;s usernames and passwords to be sent to me .
the good news is , and i do have good news to share with you , we don &apos;t need to wait for governments to do this .
when you zoom in , they &apos;ve got , you know , weak jaws that flip over their heads and some of their noses get punched out , but it &apos;s pretty good .
but this is now this strange concoction of high calories .
what gives us the courage ?
we watched tv ; they make tv .
and he explained that ebola threatened everything that made us human .
so then we tried a blend , and in a blend combination we tried it against h5n1 , and we got greater than 1,000 selectivity index .
and this is the kind of thing that i got back .
many of you may remember the magic wall that we built in conjunction with perceptive pixel where we quite literally create an infinite wall .
de : that &apos;s a great question . we actually have no idea what the theoretical limits are of what kind of data the brain can take in .
so in the technological world , we don &apos;t have experience to judge models .
i could talk to you about it right now if i wanted to , because it unlocked it .
the other reason why i really like this is because it offers an alternative entry point into the complexity of science .
i come from a family that doesn &apos;t have a whole lot of money .
we make assumptions about so-called disabilities .
once we fix it , we just might solve this problem .
okay , so how would you solve this one ?
that &apos;s 90 percent of our time surrounded by architecture .
this is a big deal , so the ticks and crosses on the screen are actually critical for young kids .
we &apos;ve got lots of little tidbits in the book .
i cannot tell you the rapture i felt holding that in my hand , and the coldness dripping onto my burning skin ; the miracle of it all , the fascination as i watched it melt and turn into water .
and we can look at cells directly .
but if i sign with a shaking hand , posterity will say , &apos; he hesitated . &apos; &quot; &quot; so he waited until he could take up the pen and sign with a bold and clear hand .
assuming that your trait does not have a big evolutionary handicap , like a mosquito that can &apos;t fly , the crispr-based gene drive will spread the change relentlessly until it is in every single individual in the population .
take your friends out , take your kids out , take your family out .
i spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean , one that focuses on attracting animals instead of scaring them away .
and tonight , you &apos;ll be able to see the device in the tent .
what was i going to do ?
and people who believed what he believed took his cause , and they made it their own , and they told people .
six is a tiny and very sad black hole .
do you know that ?
now , fincher is an interesting guy .
you have the crude oil .
a little , tiny guy walks along . more servo drives , lots of servo hacking , lots of mechanical stuff .
management of forests , transportation , the oceans , the melting of the permafrost .
so we were in front of a strange new cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently .
( laughter ) the microbes that cover us .
it shows very well that eyes can hear , and this is interesting to me because technology allows us to present sound to the eyes in ways that accentuate the strength of the eyes for seeing sound , such as the removal of time .
and here was the most intriguing result : the task allocation .
i went to turin in may .
to understand all this , i interviewed a top official from the ruling party in turkey , and i ask him , &quot; &quot; how do you do it ? &quot; &quot; they too use digital technology extensively , so that &apos;s not it .
thank you very much .
this was the case in oklahoma city , when the mayor came running to me , very upset , because they were named in prevention magazine the worst city for pedestrians in the entire country .
i don &apos;t even think that music videos or pornography are really directly related to that , but something is going wrong , and when i hear that statistic , one of the things i think of is that &apos;s a lot of sexual assailants .
when they don &apos;t work , someone or something is to blame .
and doing this for 14 billion years , we end up with this picture , which is a very important graph , showing relative abundances of chemical elements in sun-like stars and in the interstellar medium .
after the fourth rejection , we requested reconsideration of the manuscript , because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology .
i knew nothing about wofford and even less about methodism , but i was reassured on the first day that i taught at wofford college to find , among the auditors in my classroom , a 90-year-old hungarian , surrounded by a bevy of middle-aged european women who seemed to function as an entourage of rhinemaidens .
captive breeding will be a major part of bringing back these species .
the first question is , how did the number of deaths per year from natural disaster , how did that change during the last century ?
so the project is going very , very well , and i urge you to check out the website and watch this space .
the crabs are missing spines , so they have a problem in this kind of rough terrain .
for example , in addition to being an activist , i &apos;m also a professional stand-up comedian .
woman # 2 : i &apos;m a little bit confused . woman # 3 : they look like the squares to me .
and that &apos;s the story with climate-change heating .
all right .
this balancing ability will have appliactions for humanoid robotics and human assistive technologies .
if anyone wants to try and play drums , then they can .
his name is matt weiger .
he &apos;s developing energy in this area through thought .
teenagers in our community will often go to an adult that is not their parent to ask for advice .
the example on your left side is ip-mapping , a computer-generated map of ip addresses ; again — servers , machines .
leadership needs to be capable , determined and visionary in its commitment to peace .
it &apos;s called programming .
that &apos;s a good english sentence .
the gas that they used at first , in many cases , was oxygen .
can we observe them taking place in the natural world ?
the nurses , anesthesiologist , the surgeon , all the assistants are waiting around .
if they did , it probably was right there at ground zero .
extraordinary .
and i think there &apos;s almost a paradox with those .
but , in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries , our language isn &apos;t allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want , the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable .
we spend so much time in this culture being driven and aggressive , and i spend a lot of time being those things too .
we haven &apos;t even started the american stockpile .
the other piece of good news , for a scientist at least , is that much remains to be discovered .
what we mean when we say those things is : i see you there .
you know , you would ask patients questions and some people would tell you , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t , don &apos;t , don &apos;t listen to what the patients said . &quot; &quot; we know that patients know and understand their bodies better , but these days we &apos;re trying to divorce them from that idea . we have to reconcile the patient &apos;s knowledge of their body with physician &apos;s measurements .
so he doesn &apos;t actually do anything himself .
across my residual limb are electrodes that measure the electrical pulse of my muscles .
turns out it wasn &apos;t so easy .
they , businesses , other citizens &apos; groups , have enormous power to affect the lives of our fellow human beings .
there &apos;s a deep resistance because using these tools forces us to confront that we &apos;re not a system , forces us to behave with a different set of values .
i figure i &apos;m attracted to maybe one out of 10 of those men , and there was no way i was going to deal with somebody who was an avid golfer .
when we use the word &quot; &quot; architect &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; designer , &quot; &quot; what we usually mean is a professional , someone who gets paid , and we tend to assume that it &apos;s those professionals who are going to be the ones to help us solve the really big , systemic design challenges that we face like climate change , urbanization and social inequality .
because they are actually the same thing .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jumps on this curve , on moore &apos;s law , and experiences price performance doubling every 12 to 24 months .
if we are truly going to make real progress in addressing poverty , then we have to make sure that every school that serves children in poverty is a real school , a school , a school — ( applause ) — a school that provides them with knowledge and mental training to navigate the world around them .
in fact , he observed that many with the fortune of being born american were nonetheless trapped in lives that made second chances like his impossible .
oh , i know when the coconut &apos;s about to fall .
i &apos;ll start with insulin , diabetes medication in the u.s.
the issue is not that .
so it was kind of weird to see those images and those eyes stare back at me through a television .
can you hear anything ?
this number exploded with the great recession , but it turns out people actually like living this way .
and you have to , first you have to convince yourself .
we can see that they travel different countries , so if you focus on a problem locally , it &apos;s not going to help you .
so now the fusions of technologies are ready to help me see the real world .
so we can throw it out like that . let &apos;s reset it .
do you know that it takes years for a drug to go from an idea to being tested on cells in a laboratory , to animal studies , to then clinical trials on humans , finally to go through a regulatory approval process , to be available for your doctor to prescribe to you ?
and millions of them around the world are turning to complementary and alternative forms of medicine , which tend to tap into sort of slower , gentler , more holistic forms of healing .
it was the congolese women who are now rising up .
i was still interested in this question of how do you take bandages off burn patients .
the entire art of what is going on in these memory contests , and the entire art of remembering stuff better in everyday life , is figuring out ways to transform capital b bakers into lower-case b bakers — to take information that is lacking in context , in significance , in meaning , and transform it in some way , so that it becomes meaningful in the light of all the other things that you have in your mind .
i want to tell you very happily that we were successful that day in getting her back over the rail .
and then i thought , that &apos;s too complicated . no , i &apos;ll just take my favorite bits and pieces and i &apos;ll put them inside the pantheon but keep the scale , so you can see the top of sant &apos;ivo and the pyramid of cestius and the tempietto of bramante all side by side in this amazing space .
we began with a small literacy class to read the koran , then a math class , then an english class , then computer classes .
because as they learn to code , it enables them to learn many other things , opens up many new opportunities for learning .
but when you start to read the article by cliff , who himself is a cancer survivor , who was saved by a clinical trial where his parents drove him from new york city to upstate new york to get an experimental therapy for — at the time — hodgkin &apos;s disease , which saved his life , he makes remarkable points here .
but our two hands still remain outside the screen .

so , martin , he works with a system called the protocell .
brugger and his colleague , christine mohr , gave subjects l-dopa .
ciasurveillancevan .
but first we ought to be capturing bigger , cheaper savings that are normally ignored and are not in the textbooks .
( clicks ) thank you .
the thing is , this idea of chinese-american food doesn &apos;t exist only in america .
some poems even tell you that that is what they can do .
let me talk about my own experience .
we &apos;re going to start and realize that the entire visible universe , everything we can see in every direction with the hubble space telescope plus our other instruments , was once in a region that was smaller than an atom .
it &apos;s a very trivial thing .
we don &apos;t know what the atmospheres of these planets are like because the planets are so small and dim compared to their stars and so far away from us .
and if everything goes smoothly , one to two weeks from now you &apos;ll know where the epidemic was today .
and so folks like ami klin have developed methods to be able to take infants , small babies , and be able to use biomarkers , in this case eye contact and eye tracking , to identify an infant at risk .
how about 40 ? okay , it &apos;s a whole varied response .
it all started when we at cern saw something intriguing in our data : a hint of a new particle , an inkling of a possibly extraordinary answer to this question .
in northern california , we &apos;re beginning to take observations with the first 42 telescopes of the allen telescope array — and i &apos;ve got to take a moment right now to publicly thank paul allen and nathan myhrvold and all the teamseti members in the ted community who have so generously supported this research .
&quot; &quot; well , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; there &apos;s nothing to make an englishman shit faster than the sight of general george washington . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) ( applause ) so you can imagine , if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting — and he had hundreds of these stories — you would have to relax .
yeah . i thought so . i &apos;m also not surprised .
he was a christian guy during the weekends , but during the week he was a scientist .
i love those experiments , but i think that the most profound and life-changing experiment that i &apos;ve done is my most recent experiment , where i spent a year trying to follow all of the rules of the bible , &quot; the year of living biblically . &quot;
what crazy person would pop their head through a glass ceiling ?
what ?
and he took schwarzschild &apos;s idea to the prussian academy of sciences the next week .
but this is not a very efficient way to organize a regulation of wealth dynamics .
so let me show you the scene , and then i basically used the trick that was identified by sergei eisenstein , which is , if you have a camera that &apos;s moving with a moving object , what is not moving appears to be moving , and what is moving appears to be stopped , so what you &apos;re actually seeing now is the train is not moving at all , and what is actually moving is the floor .
in this country , if we win the election , we are going to make all government spending over 25,000 pounds transparent and available online , searchable for anyone to see .
sooner or later , sooner or later , the rule of history is that where power goes governance must follow .
so really the resolution is quite incredible .
it shows a cockroach moving over incredibly rough terrain without tipping over , and it &apos;s able to do this because its legs are a combination of rigid materials , which is what we traditionally use to make robots , and soft materials .
and there are hints of this .
now this is a real project that we worked on , literally , you would not believe how hard .
if you are a bit short in mathematical skills , don &apos;t worry .
so here &apos;s the thing .
this time , there &apos;s new treatments on the horizon .
tackling social and environmental problems at the same time with the same solution yields great cost savings , wealth generation and national security .
if she fails , we &apos;re all headed to the gallows ; if she passes , we can leave to vietnam .
what kepler does is discover a lot of candidates , which we then follow up and find as planets , confirm as planets .
it &apos;s true .
this is actually from one of — the paper that she translated .
( applause ) that &apos;s really amazing . ( applause )
now i also had a 10-year-old son , and turned my attention to bageye and i went in search of him .

some images from mars , 1997 .
dh : all right , we &apos;ll do this trick , but please remember it took us over 10 years to perfect .
those are the two hardest and costliest parts of making a car .
they said , &quot; &quot; let &apos;s present this to the leaders of our country . &quot; &quot; so in december we met in miami , in a hotel conference room .
and this was a very long list — over 700 rules .
here in a cap h , which is all straight lines , the two are in almost perfect sync on the cartesian grid .
to conclude , i would actually like to say , you may think this is about rats , these projects , but in the end it is about people .
today they grade essays . they diagnose certain diseases .
and i have a collection , probably 10 or 15 headlines , from highbrow magazines deploring the fact that the arts are in decline in our time .
( applause )

more recently , harvey cushing , who really developed neurosurgery as we know it , who changed it from a field of medicine that had a majority of deaths resulting from surgery to one in which there was a hopeful outlook , he was very conscious that he was not always going to do the right thing .
however , there &apos;s a big problem with the official statistics , in that if , for instance , a japanese component supplier ships something to china to be put into an ipod , and then the ipod gets shipped to the u.s. , that component ends up getting counted multiple times .
before 1980 , do you have any idea how many articles were in the new york times on domestic violence ?

my whole family has lived here , i raised my children here , and my children will also raise their children here .
the tags cost 3500 dollars each , and then satellite time is another 500 dollars , so you &apos;re like , oh , i hope the tag is okay .
it was predominantly a white , rich , corporate group that was not representative of the city .
today in our modern world , because of the internet , because of the kinds of things people have been talking about here , everything is connected to everything .
so there it is .
i &apos;m going to give you two examples quickly .
so the blue dots are selected randomly .
certainly this is not the first time that we &apos;ve had great progress with women .
i was asked to come here and speak about creation .

and the flowers don &apos;t really have to be that gaudy .
well , the thesis of &quot; &quot; the bottom billion &quot; &quot; is that a billion people have been stuck living in economies that have been stagnant for 40 years , and hence diverging from the rest of mankind .
and i realized that i haven &apos;t opened it because it represents something important — to me . it represents my grandfather .
the game costs about 80 million dollars to make , so basically it pays for itself in about a month .
so i time-stamp my life every few moments .
what makes our story especially important is that we have learned so much from a group of students who are typically not at the top of the academic ladder — students of color , students underrepresented in selected areas .
we can do bigger car stunts than ever before now .

they have to be wound on huge rollers , shipped in oversized freighters .

if you know anything about the history of computers , you will know that in the &apos; 30s and the &apos; 40s , simple computers were created that started the computer revolution we have today , and you would be correct , except for you &apos;d have the wrong century .
and we have 24 seconds each .
that second red line is religion .

so he got joshua bell to take his million dollar violin down to a washington d.c. subway station and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make .
at a certain point , this rejection slip , in 1977 — &#91; we regret that we are unable to use the enclosed material . thank you for giving us the opportunity to consider it . &#93; — magically changed to this .
marcel proust said , &quot; &quot; the true voyage of discovery is not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes . &quot; &quot; people that have partnered with us have given us new eyes , not only on what exists — the new landscapes at the bottom of the sea — but also how we think about life on the planet itself .
so now on to something completely different .
so , in the next eight minutes i would like to share with you my story .
the worst idea in all of psychology is the idea that the mind is a blank slate at birth .

every time a young baby learns something new — to focus its eyes , to mimic a movement or a facial expression , to pick something up , to form a word or to sit up — new synaptic connections are being built in the brain .

now , at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists or physical anthropologists in the audience , basically there &apos;s not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups .

i &apos;m used to algorithms and data structures and super motivated students , and nothing in my background prepared me to deal with a raging , violent adolescent in the middle of nowhere .
dr. martin luther king , jr . , in a 1968 speech where he reflects upon the civil rights movement , states , &quot; &quot; in the end , we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends . &quot; &quot; as a teacher , i &apos;ve internalized this message .
i wish you all a most activating journey .
so we really have to change this .
the iranians believed that whatever they did , even if they moderated their policies , the u.s. would continue to seek iran &apos;s isolation , and the only way iran could compel washington to change its position was by imposing a cost on the u.s. if it didn &apos;t .
but they didn &apos;t think that those numbers were related to them .
we here inside the room , i believe that we have the same concern , and the model that we created in brazil , we can transplant it here .
so we know flowers , we know fruits and vegetables , even some alfalfa in hay that the livestock for the meats that we eat , rely on pollinators , but you &apos;ve got male and female parts to a plant here , and basically pollinators are attracted to plants for their nectar , and in the process , a bee will visit some flowers and pick up some pollen , or that male kind of sperm counterpart , along the way , and then travel to different flowers , and eventually an apple , in this case , will be produced .
it &apos;s just a design of pitches and silence and time .
of course , we know that we &apos;re going to get old .
so again , financial engineering was helpful here .
they can create a much happier life for billions towards the future .
and i ask you that because we are increasingly in one .
well , i plan my route so that i &apos;m drifting with the winds and the currents while i &apos;m sleeping .
and then we poll the public and see where they score worst .
so my prediction is that we are going to ingest information you &apos;re going to swallow a pill and know english .
i worked on concepts like an electronic tattoo , which is augmented by touch , or dresses that blushed and shivered with light .
when you play in a race , win ! — because when you win , the exhilaration of victory is the closest you will come to the ambrosia of the gods . &quot; &quot; because , you see , the greeks believed you live only once , and when you die , you have to cross the river styx .
so , one of the things that we use a lot to recognize people will never be written in the genome .
khaled saeed was killed in june 2010 .
there is no kind of center where everything happens .
why ? because if they aren &apos;t seeing that , it could be a red flag that their organization isn &apos;t as aligned as it could potentially be .
the self that lives in the long narrative arc and the self that experiences the moment become one .
and it also involved new choices for leaders .
simple menus put on a board , achieving , kind of , the sort of balance .
it takes a long time to learn how to do that , and they excavated the area and they found that this material culture , this way of doing it , these rocks , had passed down for at least 4,300 years through 225 chimpanzee generations .
i haven &apos;t told many people this , but in my head , i &apos;ve got thousands of secret worlds all going on all at the same time .
heike moses : hello everyone , i &apos;m heike , and i think it just kills the intrinsic motivation , so in the respect that children , if they would like to read , you just take this incentive away in just paying them , so it just changes behavior .
and to my mind , the scientific method — trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it doesn &apos;t — is one of the great accomplishments of humanity .
they &apos;re normally backroom or basement hardware service providers , but they need to be elevated to software strategists .
he said , &quot; &quot; do you have any questions ? &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; just one , doc .
so we made this box , and we tested it again and again and again , and we &apos;re going through multiple iterations to do these things .
miasmas didn &apos;t kill people . bacteria killed people .

well , for animals that are trying to avoid predators by staying in the darkness , light can still be very useful for the three basic things that animals have to do to survive : and that &apos;s find food , attract a mate and avoid being eaten .
( laughter ) okay . ( laughter )
they didn &apos;t want to go to a componentized system .
the second is for continued population , human population expansion .
gambia : we went to select a grandmother in gambia .
and ultimately , we become more human .
it was a little over 100 years ago that beijerinck discovered viruses .
let &apos;s consider for a while the option of monotasking .
so that means that they can try out new stuff without the embarrassment of having to pay if it didn &apos;t work , which for still quite a lot of bits of government , that &apos;s a serious issue .
there are lots of small streets .
it was just , &quot; &quot; because i say so .
and after about 15 or 20 minutes of this , she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said , &quot; &quot; come on , bryan . you and i are going to have a talk . &quot; &quot; and i remember this just like it happened yesterday .
what may be more reprehensible , if climate denial continues , is extermination of species .
and the very structure of an affair , the fact that you can never have your lover , keeps you wanting .
i &apos;m going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet , and not in the traditional sense , not just the gay closet .
and that fascinated me , to explore that territory .
and if it stops us from noticing and fixing those problems , well , then that &apos;s really bad .
rather than preceding the insurgency , the taliban followed the troop deployment , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , the troop deployment caused their return .
so these are the three arguments that i &apos;m going to give you quickly today .
10 years ago there , were very few countries that received sovereign ratings from the standard &amp; poors , moody &apos;s and fitch &apos;s .
it &apos;s odd . it has a battery .
and these people have taught me that radical body politics is the antidote to our body-shaming culture .
her cancer continued to grow .

this one came from the sulfur dioxide from mount pinatubo in 1991 — cooled the earth by half a degree .
and i also have a little bit of a sort of smartass subtitle to this .
anyhow , i &apos;ll end that there , and thank you very much .
instead of , like , copper in 10 or 15 .
it works just purely on its form .
but i want to give the last word back to the novelists , and to philip roth , who ended by saying , &quot; &quot; the fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway .
there are four on-board micro-controllers that , each time this ring rotates it , as it passes the rear of the display , it picks up a position signal .
and this actually represented kind of a sea change to me .
it adjusts continually . and we removed the air conditioning .
they love them .
but the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now , but that things are already inevitably changing , and what we need to do is to work creatively with that , based on asking the right questions .
the second point , would you really buy a car just based on the advice of the dealer ?
yet we have this idea , we humans , that the earth — all of it : the oceans , the skies — are so vast and so resilient it doesn &apos;t matter what we do to it .
your kids could go to school , go to college , go away and have kids of their own , come back , bring the grandkids , you &apos;ll have the same lightbulb saving you energy .
what &apos;s that time worth ?
here we are flying in haiti last summer , where we &apos;ve done our first field trials .
i drew the logo for citibank on a napkin in the first meeting .
and most of the time , you &apos;ll find this insect lives in and around your home , so this — whatever we do has got to get to that insect .
when we started this out , we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem , which is why we chose the smallest genome .
now the first step , pretty easy .
in fact , it was beginning , and the 23 years since is a story of acknowledgment , apology and atonement .
what about martin luther king ?
he blew himself up , killing six .
i would say , we should call ourselves coctivors — ( laughter ) from coquere , to cook .
so , scientists knew all of that already , but it still doesn &apos;t fully explain how natalia found one so far north .
am : so , these are the sprint legs , and i can put my other ...
and they said you have to say bye to her , you have to do what you have to do .
it &apos;s pretty amazing , isn &apos;t it ?
i mean , who &apos;s carrying around an electron microscope in their pocket ?
we need to know what they say they want , not what they want in their heart of hearts , not what they think they can get , but what they say they want , because that is a strategically chosen position , and we can work backwards from that to draw inferences about important features of their decision-making .
suppose a terrorist wants to blow up a building , and he wants to do this again and again in the future .
your brain is locked in a vault of silence and darkness inside your skull .
thanks very much , and give me your card and sometime we &apos;ll talk . &quot; &quot; i didn &apos;t know ebay from that jar of water sitting on that piano , but i had the presence of mind to go back and talk to one of the techie kids at my center .
biophonies and geophonies are the signature voices of the natural world , and as we hear them , we &apos;re endowed with a sense of place , the true story of the world we live in .
he &apos;s going to have to correct for that with steering .
we are not competing for news .
it &apos;s all bad . my brothers get everything . &quot; &quot; and this girl just sat up and went , &quot; &quot; i love being a girl .
we invited 10 of the top mars scientists to the langley research center for two days .
and the simple fact is , if we are focused on ourselves , if we &apos;re preoccupied , as we so often are throughout the day , we don &apos;t really fully notice the other .
and finally , in part because of technology , the world is incredibly flux at the moment .
that &apos;s how linked data works .
and that &apos;s how i &apos;ve discovered that if i feel what is in the story — in one story — then i come the closest , i think , to knowing what compassion is , to feeling that compassion .
probably because when we admit we can do something about it , we &apos;ve got to do something about it .
they develop a persona , a signature style , much like fashion designers .
there is nothing — but a nuclear war of a kind we &apos;ve never seen — that can stop this &#91; growth &#93; from happening .

she won with 75 percent of the vote .
this is from stanford &apos;s computer science 101 class , and the students are supposed to color-correct that blurry red image .
and one day i was exploring this cul-de-sac hidden away a few streets away .
we have the individual power to go , &quot; &quot; this is what i want to do . &quot; &quot; and in a pointless universe , that , to me , is a wonderful thing .
it &apos;s serving the purpose of illumination , but at the same time , we are able to transmit this data .
and then a funny thing happened — they sold .
( laughter ) i promise .
we figured out how to put a vapor-compression distiller on this thing , with a counter-flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat , then using a little bit of the electricity control that process , and for 450 watts , which is a little more than half of its waste heat , it will make 10 gallons an hour of distilled water from anything that comes into it to cool it .
and how far down into it you figure we &apos;ll have to scroll to get to the golden ticket ?
i never saw his face .
i was the youngest by at least a decade , but somehow the poets at the bowery poetry club didn &apos;t seem bothered by the 14-year-old wandering about .
this allows you to drag and drop these blocks of semantic code and create any behavior for this robot you want .
remember , i was young then .
what in the laboratory that i see out there , the laboratories of democracy , what has happened ?
the real issue in cellular biology is we are never going to understand everything , because it &apos;s a multidimensional problem put there by evolution .
that &apos;s why we are so scared about flu , isn &apos;t it ?
my inspiration comes from problems in my daily life .
i think it &apos;s time for the subject to go public .
i needed to go deeper .
and in 2011 , he was running a big campaign to address everyday corruption in india , a topic that indian elites love to ignore .
where does it lie on that chart ?
so , when i started this , i didn &apos;t have an overall plan for the machine , but i did have a sense of the gesture , and a sense of the shape and how it would occupy space .
and it &apos;s something i &apos;m very excited to be a part of .
peace piberesima : we &apos;re doing films for the masses .
as an evolutionary biologist , i &apos;d say this : our brains have evolved to help us survive within the orders of magnitude , of size and speed which our bodies operate at .
we get far more questions right on i.q. tests than each succeeding generation back to the time that they were invented .
the goal was to destroy secretly the self-confidence of people , for example by damaging their reputation , by organizing failures in their work , and by destroying their personal relationships .
and then in moments of high adrenaline , like when something exciting was happening , i would up that photographic frequency to as many as 37 photographs in five minutes .
and it &apos;s a brand new leadership challenge .
one of the things i did not stress in that introduction was that , systematically , the pace of life decreases as you get bigger .
and i was calling about how to make ajiaco . it &apos;s a cuban meal .
when we &apos;re turning , we have the feeling of surfing , and the way it &apos;s going up-wind , it &apos;s very efficient .
i started to prospect under the benches of bakeries and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points .
this picture is incredible .
surprise slams us in the face .
turns out , they wander a lot . in fact , really a lot .
( laughter ) it &apos;s true . ( applause ) you &apos;ve all probably had similar experiences and felt this way too .
he was told that a cure did not exist .
it seemed we couldn &apos;t turn off the production of nitric oxide in the skin of humans .
( applause ) a criminal justice system that acknowledges the legacy of exclusion that poor people of color in the u.s. have faced and that does not promote and perpetuate those exclusions . ( applause )
and in my third year , i started becoming confused because i was yemeni , but i was also mixing up with a lot of my friends in college .
he got married . he had a son called jeremiah .
but there &apos;s a far worse danger confronting us .
i was hooked . i was hooked . ( laughter ) cold water was constantly on my mind , and from that point on , my career focused on these types of harsh and unforgiving environments , and it took me to places like russia , norway , alaska , iceland , chile , the faroe islands , and a lot of places in between .
so our cost for this was less than 10,000 dollars , all right .
income per person . i can put that here .
now these provisional structures have , in some cases , remained standing for the better part of a human lifetime .
so basically , you have a group of people who are excited by the idea .
i &apos;m not taking sides .
let me give you an example .
so , naturally , they chased him out of town .
here &apos;s the united states — considerably richer than new zealand , but with a lower level of social progress .
he slammed his hands on the desk and he said , &quot; hey , everybody ! group hug ! group hug ! &quot;
so , this is the kind of thing i &apos;m talking about .
she &apos;s an inspiration .
so here &apos;s how things play out .
so that was a big wake-up call in the 1980 &apos;s .
the old jack tales that he had learned — he talked like this , you could hardly understand him . but it was really wonderful .
( applause )
for a shower , i walked 40 blocks to a branch of my gym .
so gdp goes up a lot — fantastic ! that &apos;s the short run .
when that happened , he started calling all the neighborhood children , like , children would come and see what &apos;s happening over here .
( laughter ) yesterday , the automotive guys gave us some new insights .
so if you go back about two and a half billion years , the earth was this big , sterile hunk of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around on it .
and here , here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the tanzanian giraffe .
like , hats off to south africa and turkey and israel and somalia and japan and gambia .
what if my roommate knew about the female lawyer who recently went to court in nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband &apos;s consent before renewing their passports ?
so that &apos;s idea one : recognize interdependence .
it does concern you , as well .
physical objects are simply icons in that desktop .
i took this picture from a small plane flying over the eastern border of the xingu indigenous reserve in the state of mato grosso to the northwest of here .

and — and you can get somebody to eat something that &apos;s good for them once , but they won &apos;t eat it again if they don &apos;t like it , right ?
they &apos;re like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them .
recently we &apos;ve been battered with the idea that maybe we didn &apos;t even have our own creation event , here on earth , which people didn &apos;t like much . and then the human genome said , maybe we only have 35,000 genes . and that was really — people didn &apos;t like that , we &apos;ve got more genes than that .
so , we believe that values-driven spending will force capitalism to be better .
we need women to have babies , and we are actively disincentivizing working women from doing that .
( applause ) and doug pritchard , who &apos;s the head of visualization at the glasgow school of art .

reading and enjoying literature and words that begin with &apos; b. &apos; &quot; &quot; the bath : &quot; &quot; assemble students on a rug and give students a warning about the dangers of hot water .
we actually need to bring all of our intelligence to becoming stupid again — clueless &#91; before &#93; the immensity of the unknown .
but the modality of attention , or what is happening today , what &apos;s happening tomorrow .
then , at the top , there is a before and an after image of the landing .
so what can we do about that ? what can we say ?
on the other hand , we don &apos;t know how to accommodate it into our scientific view of the world .
wipe it up , throw it away .
pretty clever , right ?
basically they went to the ballot boxes to tell that they have nobody to vote for .
special olympics is transforming their lives off the field .
when the room smelled gross , what we saw was that individuals actually reported more negative attitudes toward gay men .
and i &apos;m not even sure we know what technology is .
they were identical except for one thing .
we parse it out on an as-needed basis , sometimes for very good reasons , other times just because we don &apos;t understand the gaps in our lives .
i had them keep track of their time for a week so i could add up how much they worked and slept , and i interviewed them about their strategies , for my book .
i would not let an adult drive my robot .
what if you had no access to public libraries ?
one , two , three and four .
we know that the brain is capable of extraordinary change , and the best way to achieve that , even in adults , is to change and modulate our environment .
so thank you .
i &apos;m here to talk about very real killer robots , autonomous combat drones .
it &apos;s 350 people on the committee for oklahoma city , which is why we thought of this as a sort of ad-hoc , spontaneous solution that expanded on union square and the places that were ad-hoc memorials in the city already .
there &apos;s an anteroom with photographs of children who perished and then you come into a large space .
and basically , it &apos;s a system made of two components — a sensing and an actuating component .
ma : i think we &apos;re slowly changing , but obviously there are whole pockets in countries where nothing is different .
foremost among them is the exorbitant cost of sending money home .
for example , true story : just a few weeks ago , this cab driver , upon finding out that a friend and i were in town for a game developers &apos; conference , turned around and said — and i quote — &quot; &quot; i hate games . waste of life .
think about this for a second .
as long as these devices are there , or there is suspicion of landmines , you can &apos;t really enter into the land .
it has a tail . and just when you think you &apos;ve figured out nature , this kind of thing happens .
( laughter ) my company , called freelance programmers , and that &apos;s precisely what it was , couldn &apos;t have started smaller : on the dining room table , and financed by the equivalent of 100 dollars in today &apos;s terms , and financed by my labor and by borrowing against the house .
i &apos;m going to talk to you today about hopefully converting fear into hope .
so this is a local person potentially deciding whether to enter the babysitting market .
be aware of these people who &#91; are &#93; coming to you in order to ruin your great civilization . &quot; &quot; fortunately , people right now cannot be deceived .
we know now that that is not the case because of the greenhouse gases that coal produces .
and yet the politicization of never again , the operationalization of never again , had never occurred in the 20th century .
we &apos;re all mammals here , we all have a lot of neural and hormonal programming that makes us really bond with others , care for others , feel compassion for others , especially the weak and vulnerable .
dh : i think so , that &apos;s right .
and we make the machine meet them half way .
and because working in a store was so hard , i liked going to school ; it was like heaven .
and they &apos;re totally emotionally excited about the fact that they walk around thinking of themselves as a creative person .
but also it &apos;s part of being any monthly magazine — you live in the future . and we have a long lead-time .
( laughter ) i &apos;m teasing you , sweetheart . no , i &apos;m comfortable with any question .
everything we blog , everything we tweet , and everything we click is a public act of making media .
not just with their puppy , but with the rest of the family at class .
if you read a book , pull things up .
before most kids are 12 , they &apos;ll have been to disney world more times than they &apos;ve been in a canoe or camping under a starry sky .
governments executed people for frivolous reasons , like stealing a cabbage or criticizing the royal garden .
so the five of us , two americans , two italians and a spaniard , we — ( laughter ) you know , it &apos;s a worldwide project . ( laughter ) so we came together in this design institute called the interaction design institute ivrea , which was teaching interaction design , this idea that you can take design from the simple shape of an object and you can move it forward to design the way you interact with things .
ab : 987 squared is 974,169 .
and it was then that i thought back to my jittery hands .
i have worked with more than 500 companies .
can i tell you how un-canadian that is ?
so what do you do with a dead mall , dead office park ?
do we really believe that god is the kind of male boss that we &apos;ve been presenting in our worship and in our liturgies over all these years ?
and we have a lot of it sitting around , because this is a big problem .
azuri , hi , how are you doing ?
here &apos;s an ad in the new york times somebody did for a play called &quot; &quot; mind games . &quot; &quot; then &quot; &quot; chicago &quot; &quot; came out , used similar graphics , and the public theater &apos;s identity was just totally eaten and taken away , which meant i had to change it .
this change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in africa , and they allowed us to start to expand around the world .
here , this is a protocell , and it &apos;s vigorously shedding this skin .
but i really believe that a fully operating , rich society needs these seeds coming from all directions and all disciplines in order to keep the gears of inspiration and imagination flowing and cycling and growing .
it has curves in two directions , one curve upward and opposite transverse curve down the other , so any kind of perturbation spreads the forces over the surface of this type of shape .
and it &apos;s apparently okay to marry a boy from georgia , but not to have hair from texas .
and the umbrella campaign was &quot; &quot; thank god it &apos;s monday . &quot; &quot; so , we tried to take this — what was perceived as a negative : their over-competitiveness , their , you know , long working hours — and turn it into a positive and not run from it .
if they have a hip fracture we go with them and we study their entire discharge experience .
so i couldn &apos;t handle it .
still exists back home .
&quot; &quot; it is a pity , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; that the police in this country are not tough enough on bad drivers . &quot; &quot; i was baffled .
or should they not ?
80 percent of africans still rely on traditional medicine .
if you can use jelly to make a robot — now , we eat jelly , right ?
so in the morning , in between six and seven in the morning , the body is then transported inside of the body bag to our center and is being scanned through one of the ct scanners .
the participants at improv everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other new yorkers , they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way .
and i thought like , &quot; &quot; wow . i &apos;m like , living in a science fiction movie .
and what we &apos;re seeing is , can we expand the human umvelt so that he comes to have , after several weeks , a direct perceptual experience of the economic movements of the planet .
einstein once said , &quot; &quot; logic will get you from a to b.
and i did one that was about 35 feet long .
that &apos;s where i live , and it &apos;s my university as well .
in the lab , we get people to come to the lab , sit in front of a computer screen , and we give them little tasks that i &apos;m going to get you to do again .
so you can see that the fibers wrap in helices , and those fibers can reorient as the skeleton moves , which means the skeleton &apos;s flexible .
they are my heroes and my father is my hero , who understood democracy and guided me through it .
these vibrios , these bacteria , can actually infect people .
think of the expense , the human cost of that .
we should be angry , because this is wrong , and it &apos;s rude , and it should not be done .
not because it &apos;s a job , not because it &apos;s a career , but because it &apos;s a calling .
you can stay with me for 20 years , go tomorrow .
we &apos;re talking about a pick , pack and ship setting here .
noise becomes music .
a country like america has four times the amount of food that it needs .
and as you know , everybody loves that , too .
as weeks of deprivation stretched into months , some resorted to eating tulip bulbs .
or does somebody want to run a marathon , or does somebody want to ballroom dance ?
so what i &apos;m going to do is , every now and again , i will make this gesture , and in a moment of powerpoint democracy , you can imagine what you &apos;d like to see .
well , we used to use trampettes . in the old days , that &apos;s all they had .
we &apos;re going to then apply one of those stains to it , and we scan it .
you could regain this time .
the mind , our most valuable and precious resource , through which we experience every single moment of our life .
and that &apos;s more or less the story of the coral reefs of the caribbean , and increasingly , tragically , the coral reefs worldwide .
( laughter ) you know , that &apos;s what you call a lead . ( laughter )
and these are sometimes unsafe places to send our sickest patients , especially in an era of superbugs and hospital-acquired infections .
how are we going to find these planets ?
think about it with the corexit hitting the membranes , and it will clog up the gills , and then these animals are going to be getting something like what you call chemical pneumonia , trying to aspirate the compounds .
granted , we &apos;re not sending humans up at the moment , well at least with our own launch vehicles , but nasa is far from dead , and one of the reasons why we write a program like this is so that people realize that there &apos;s so many other things that we &apos;re doing .
this is still not really ideal for research , though , because it &apos;s not entirely clear where all of these passwords came from , or exactly what policies were in effect when people created these passwords .
get yourself a fat reward . life &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; i can &apos;t do it .
i &apos;m a contemporary artist and i show in art galleries and museums .
and portland is not alone here .
i know many well-intentioned non-muslims who &apos;ve begun reading the koran , but given up , disconcerted by its &quot; &quot; otherness . &quot; &quot; the historian thomas carlyle considered muhammad one of the world &apos;s greatest heroes , yet even he called the koran &quot; &quot; as toilsome reading as i ever undertook , a wearisome , confused jumble . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) part of the problem , i think , is that we imagine that the koran can be read as we usually read a book — as though we can curl up with it on a rainy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn within reach , as though god — and the koran is entirely in the voice of god speaking to muhammad —
so essentially , the shape of the building that you &apos;re born into is the shape of the structure which carries you to your ancestral resting place .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s , since it was invented a year or two ago , has given me untold happiness .
we did not prioritize right .
we call it &quot; &quot; liquid lead dancing . &quot; &quot; jf : let &apos;s try this with a latin dance , salsa .
we want to strike a balance where they have the freedom to do anything but not a lot of money showered on them so they could go out and do nothing .
people here get very confused about what a punishment is .
we need women to work . we need working women to have babies .
so what we find is that there is this great deal of wasted crisis information because there is just too much information for us to actually do anything with right now .
what does this all mean ?
it is this fear that &apos;s feeding the diet industry , which is keeping so many of us from making peace with our own bodies , for waiting to be the after-photo before we truly start to live our lives .
how cheap ?
we got dirty , and we loved it .
so that &apos;s what i do . i study color a lot .
this is a book written by a consummate player by the name of kevin carroll .
after finishing his bedtime rituals , he looked at me and he asked a question : &quot; mommy , are we bad people ? &quot;
and these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid .
and we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places .
and they look like this . they &apos;re basically very simple arrangements .
we are always doing things we like in our life .
by definition the outcome is outside of our control , and if that &apos;s where we spend all of our emotional energy , we are going to get drained as we do .
and i thought , you know , what were they thinking ?
unconsciously , a concert will be connected to a brush and a roulette game will be connected to a hat .
and so we know that , for example , openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success , but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and , occasionally , odd .
dh : please stand up , richard . ( whip cracks ) oh , sorry . ( laughter ) dh : now richard , please ... ( whip cracks ) bf : ok , sorry .
this was a work made by mike tyka in our group , which he calls &quot; &quot; animal parade . &quot; &quot; it reminds me a little bit of william kentridge &apos;s artworks , in which he makes sketches , rubs them out , makes sketches , rubs them out , and creates a movie this way .
and i put 100 million cells in his cisterna magna , in his lumbar cord , and filled out the irbs and did all this work , and i never really knew .
sk : so that &apos;s the final element in it that just makes it that much more ridiculous , that there is a flag design within the milwaukee flag .
but maybe they have another faculty , something else that would seem equally irrational to us , but they actually tap into some great possible value there .
there are actually a wave of startups like connect.me and legit and trustcloud that are figuring out how you can aggregate , monitor and use your online reputation .
♫ just a little rain , just a little rain , just a little rain ♫ ♫ i want what i can &apos;t have , need what i can &apos;t want ♫ ♫ have what i don &apos;t have , what i want ♫ ♫ what i can &apos;t have , need what i can &apos;t want ♫ ♫ have but i don &apos;t have ♫ ♫ my mind won &apos;t stop , and my heart says go ♫ ♫ nobody knows how to hold me ♫ ♫ my mind won &apos;t stop , and my heart says , ♫ ♫ &quot; &quot; good things come to those who wait &quot; &quot; ♫ ♫ and i can &apos;t stand in ... ♫
maybe even find a tumor , in some cases .
a hundred companies , we can work with .
so we &apos;re seeing there &apos;s a real extension of middle age .
so i actually went to school in belfast , which was where all the action happened .
in the andes , this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city .
( laughter ) i later had a child , after getting married , and i was living essentially the egyptian-american dream .
i &apos;m going to tell you five facts about myself .
thank you .
there is the beijing olympic games coming in august 2008 , and it &apos;s very clear that the chinese government is controlling the economy and doing what it takes to also avoid any wave and control the stock market . &quot; &quot; three weeks after my presentation , the markets lost 20 percent and went through a phase of volatility , upheaval , and a total market loss of 70 percent until the end of the year .
and they &apos;re big mountains , thousands of feet tall , some of which are tens of thousands of feet and bust through the surface , creating islands like hawaii .
well , the question of origins , as with so many other questions in biology , seems to have been answered by darwin over a century ago .
i learned so much about myself .
true aliens , stocks that arrived from outer space .
you see india , you see brazil .
so as you can guess , my mother tongue is french .
which kind of delivered the answer , which i couldn &apos;t really answer , which is , &quot; &quot; what do i do with my life ? &quot; &quot; i love diplomacy — i have no career — i expected my entire life to be a diplomat , to be serving my country .
and these women would get together and just talk .
my wife , yvonne , and i , we have four kids , three grown ones and a 15-year-old .
after 12 days of storm i get to row for four hours without a flagging wind .
sophal ear : so , notwithstanding the 1970s narration , on april 17th 1975 we lived in phnom penh .
everything i was looking at seemed like it was going to kill me , but i couldn &apos;t explain why .
one more time .
but it didn &apos;t lead to the exceptional results that they were hoping for .
europe of and by the people , a europe , an experiment in deepening and widening democracy beyond borders .
and we calculated several scenarios , and the picture always looked like this .
it &apos;s a place where families can stay together to enjoy quality time with their children , many of whom are there for respite stays , some with repeated visits over a span of many years .
it can happen that these two protons can hop over .
we tend to think of emotions as just feelings .
and when it is full , it is blocked and it can go to the next .
after six days , thomas died in ross &apos;s arms surrounded by our family .
they clung to certainty in the belief that doubt would undermine them .
and i &apos;m going to show a video of the older version of it , which is just a minute long . okay .
as a matter of fact , i think a lot of my design ideas come from mistakes and tricks of the eye .
she did so much . she was a playwright .
it &apos;s one part of the form and content .
( laughter ) and with this rationale , i look at these days and i think , i &apos;m not retired . i don &apos;t feel retired at all .
now language &apos;s subversive power has been recognized throughout the ages in censorship , in books you can &apos;t read , phrases you can &apos;t use and words you can &apos;t say .
how many here would say that casey martin does have a right to use a golf cart ?
then we thought that the earth is the unmoving center of reality because it looks that way .
it &apos;s a little bit like the invasion of the body snatchers .
in this hypothetical circumstance , this civilization would have exhausted the energy supply of their home planet , so where could they get more energy ?
and so i began to sort of mess with the computer at the time .
eve , first woman .
but the question is , does this matter to babies in how they treat the puppets ? and it matters a lot .
in 2012 , we entered the competition for the angelini innovation center , and the aim was to build the right environment for knowledge creation .
they &apos;ve found small objects such as these .
and that &apos;s not the only leopards that were being killed through that period .
and then , after they get that care — like the mouse , like the skier , like the 65-year-old woman — they &apos;ll wake up .
so we &apos;re really entering the era of wearable robotics actually .
there &apos;s lots of businesses that would like to locate in the americas , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there &apos;s lots of people who &apos;d like to go there .
and the same is true for the troops .
and one of the things i really like about open source is it really allows different people to work together .
these big issues that will change the world , change national security , change economics , create hope , create threats , can only be resolved when you bring together groups of people who understand science and technology back together with government .
so you have what &apos;s called the xenon pit , and so some of these fission products love neutrons .
around that time i met an extraordinary human being , peter thum , who inspired me with his actions .
i was afraid that people would see me for who i really was , that i wasn &apos;t the perfect , popular kid in high school everyone thought i was , that beneath my smile , there was struggle , and beneath my light , there was dark , and beneath my big personality just hid even bigger pain .
&#91; the civil war in syria may seem far away &#93; &#91; until you experience it yourself . &#93; ( girl singing ) ( explosion ) &#91; project syria &#93; &#91; a virtual reality experience &#93; np : we were then invited to take the piece to the victoria and albert museum in london .
the time is now for us to show them fairness , and we can do that , you and i , by starting where we work , in the businesses that we operate in .
honeybee robotics designed the mars driller , and it was really very much fun to work with them .
we decided to do something a little bit different and transform flavors that were very familiar — so in this case , we have carrot cake .
it becomes more and more and more expensive to dig them out .
what i found incredibly astonishing and so motivational was that these families were so motivated to support their children .
( laughter ) ( applause ) there is obviously einstein , niels bohr , de fermat &apos;s last theorem , and i &apos;m not sure whether that &apos;s james coburn or richard harris . ( laughter )
( laughter ) ilkka hanski was an ecologist in finland , and he did this experiment himself .
in a survey , 74 percent of women said that miscarriage , they felt , was partly their fault , which is awful .
in fact , this is the score for dan &apos;s piece , completely composed by dan in hyperscore .
( applause )
and my first car was a 1975 electric-green mustang .
this is called &quot; &quot; i &apos;m an emotional creature . &quot; &quot; and it happened because i met a girl in watts , l.a.
i question the entire premise of this piece , but i &apos;m always interested in hearing what they &apos;ve come up with before they call me .
( applause ) chris anderson : so , ashraf , until recently , you were the finance minister of afghanistan , a country right at the middle of much of the world &apos;s agenda .
a caterpillar &apos;s mouth .
today , their share has more than doubled to above 20 percent .
and i put a piece of tape around it , as you see there , and realized you could sit on it , and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on .
he ruled the country with an iron fist , and anyone who dared question his authority was arrested , tortured , jailed or even killed .
all we are left with is the skeleton , if you will , of the liver , all made up of collagen , a material that &apos;s in our bodies , that will not reject .
you can actually see the point when i know what i &apos;m doing , and a lot of light and dark comes into it .
holy cow ! that &apos;s just amazing .
and sooner or later , we &apos;re going to have to accept the fact that health care innovation can &apos;t always come at a much higher price .
but we can make it possible for most .
so these simple projections of the goldman sachs type are not telling us what we need to know about power transition .
in the context of this broad range of digital relations , safely seeking strangeness might very well be a new basis for that innovation .
who loves the wedding almost as much as the bride ?
and the way to it , for me , was through artistic means .
and she also got books for herself .
the first thing i learned that day was that i never ever wanted to work that hard again .
how are they connected , and what does that global conversation look like ?
these beautiful illustrations are then shut back into the pages of a medical textbook , or an app , referenced only when needed .
so one of these works is the &quot; &quot; spelling spider . &quot; &quot; so the spelling spider is a cousin of the spelling bee .
i &apos;m going to give you some building blocks and they &apos;re nonrectilinear cactus building blocks , so it &apos;s totally legit . &quot; &quot; but he doesn &apos;t really know what to do with these .
why are we conscious ?
okay , now i promised you to tell you some of the outrageous things said about consciousness .
as much as we know , there is so much more that we don &apos;t know , and so i invite all of you to be able to help us think about how to do this better , to use as a community our collective wisdom to be able to make a difference , and in particular , for the individuals in families with autism , i invite you to join the interactive autism network , to be part of the solution to this , because it &apos;s going to take really a lot of us to think about what &apos;s important , what &apos;s going to be a meaningful difference .
so i thought , why don &apos;t we get into that business ?
or perhaps an ordinary person like you or me ?
and these hands were influenced by this man , mr. inami naomi .
they need an inclusive process where the real fabric of this very complicated society can deal with their issues .
some of my hypotheses are that when you first think about skeletal muscle , there &apos;s a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle .
( applause )
( applause ) thank you .
unaids tell us that the hiv rate in zambia is 20 percent , and mortality estimates suggest it &apos;s only about 5 percent .
i had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end .
it &apos;s also very biologically active , as anyone with hay fever will understand .
now this is an extremely complicated subject , in part because the things that we call beautiful are so different .
and what you don &apos;t see in this picture is that somewhere between these riders there , there &apos;s a teenager sitting on a rock , saying , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m not moving from here . forget it .
so you &apos;d just see her feet .
or are there deeper structural factors that have led us to where we are today ?
don &apos;t want it to leave me behind . &quot; &quot; and from all around as people started singing and answering back , he sang : &quot; &quot; good news , good news : chariot &apos;s coming .
in a small country that could be my country , but could be also your country , they took a decision — it is a real case story — that all of the governmental decisions , discussions of the council of ministers , were going to be published on the internet 24 hours after the council discussions took place .
having spent 18 years as a child of the state in children &apos;s homes and foster care , you could say that i &apos;m an expert on the subject , and in being an expert , i want to let you know that being an expert does in no way make you right in light of the truth .
when they kept this under wraps , but soon others got to know .
the other week , i went on one of these sites , appropriately called swaptree , and there were over 59,300 items that i could instantly swap for my copy of &quot; &quot; 24 . &quot; &quot; lo and behold , there in reseda , ca was rondoron who wanted swap his or her &quot; like new &quot; copy of &quot; sex and the city &quot; for my copy of &quot; &quot; 24 . &quot; &quot; so in other words , what &apos;s happening here is that swaptree solves my carrying company &apos;s sugar rush problem , a problem the economists call &quot; &quot; the coincidence of wants , &quot; &quot; in approximately 60 seconds .
i &apos;ve had a grenade thrown at my office .
how are we going to do these attacks ?
so at the end of it , we concluded that groups of children can learn to use computers and the internet on their own , irrespective of who or where they were .
because our dental anatomy is actually made , not for tearing down raw meat from bones or chewing fibrous leaves for hours .
so what &apos;s going on ?
and some of these patients played a video game where they drive around a small town .
so , if you ’ re designing an interaction between two people — such as , i don ’ t know — ordering food at a fast food joint or something , you need to be able to imagine how that experience might feel over a period of time .
it was astonishing . they were also producing mangroves in a plantation .
we don &apos;t live to eat and make money .
the great hall at the met is one of the great portals of the world , awe-inspiring , like a medieval cathedral .
six hours later , up goes the temperature .
so now it &apos;s going from fish and sharks into reptiles , which , again , this is only one month old , but it shows us that we know almost nothing about this hawksbill turtle &apos;s vision .
( applause )
and fish are much more interesting than corals , because they have really advanced vision , and some of the fish even have , the way that i was photographing it , they have lenses in their eyes that would magnify the fluorescence .
they put it on fire . it was boiling hot , getting ready to give to the kids .
that &apos;s 127 rides per second , showing that this is a cross-cultural phenomenon .
and i studied very much in sweden .
the phones just aren &apos;t ringing about the people . &quot; &quot; and the reason i give you this moment is there &apos;s a deep truth in it .
to take the example of migration , we know that immigration is a net positive for the economy as a whole under almost all circumstances .
your brain does a lot of its work behind the scenes , and that is a good thing , because your conscious mind — how do we put this politely ? — it &apos;s easily distracted .
so for the partner who had the affair , for nick , one thing is to end the affair , but the other is the essential , important act of expressing guilt and remorse for hurting his wife .
now it should be clear by now that this book is in bad condition .
it &apos;s the kind of original movement for any puppet for us onstage .
they &apos;re closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason , and i believe we shouldn &apos;t tolerate that either .
when we think about why we hear , we don &apos;t often think about the ability to hear an alarm or a siren , although clearly that &apos;s an important thing .
it &apos;s about how do you create a new product or develop a new product or manufacture a new product , but not a new product itself ?
now , i became a psychologist to help mitigate human suffering , and for the past 10 years , my target has been the suffering caused by ptsd , as experienced by veterans like carlos .
first of all , if you can , don &apos;t fight the patent , fight the infringement .
zero became a person and not just a character in a play .
now , in 2010 , the australian national university did an experiment where they sent out 4,000 identical applications to entry level jobs , essentially .
so she now works full-time on this for very little pay .
thank you .
second is salicornia bigelovii . very difficult to get around the world .
&quot; drugs are fun in the beginning but become a drag later on . &quot;
and when someone accesses your medical record , a research doctor , they could see , you could see which doctor accessed it and why , and you could maybe learn about what conditions you have .
i read a dictionary . i got into college .
when food was scarce , our ancestors &apos; survival depended on conserving energy , and regaining the weight when food was available would have protected them against the next shortage .
and if we do that , we &apos;re going to stop seeing cities as big , metropolitan , unproductive blobs , like this .
ca : five years ago you had an idea . what was that ?
sebastian : draw thy sword .
i am a neuroscientist with a mixed background in physics and medicine .
we can recover sounds from other objects , like plants .
you must be tolerant .
there was another unusual boat out there at the same time , doing as i was doing , bringing awareness to the north pacific garbage patch , that area in the north pacific about twice the size of texas , with an estimated 3.5 million tons of trash in it , circulating at the center of that north pacific gyre .
so she goes from oxford , she &apos;s sent to the north of england to a mother and baby home , and appointed a social worker .
we all want to share our stories , whether it is the trick we saw at the party , the bad day at the office or the beautiful sunset we saw on vacation .
and then she gets in her root-beer colored 1994 cadillac seville , and tears down the san bernardino freeway , where she still volunteers for seven different organizations .
ouch .
and we did not know that u.s. intelligence agencies go to extremes such as infiltrating standardization bodies to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose .
so how do we test that ? well , that &apos;s easy .
the key that the marquis du lafayette sent to george washington to celebrate the storming of the bastille .
and she questioned , she hypothesized , is this a yentl syndrome ?
here &apos;s the best part : none of what i &apos;m telling you is my opinion .
why ? because during conflict economic policy typically deteriorates .
these families had been through what we had been watching on the tv .
my neck was so stiff i couldn &apos;t touch my chin to my chest , and the slightest sound — the rustling of the sheets , my husband walking barefoot in the next room — could cause excruciating pain .
and we set ourselves a goal of turning the continent green .
and my claim is that mathematics has to do with patterns .
i think that &apos;s part of what the complexity of architecture is .
what do they tell us ?
and then it got stranger .
and japan is trying to move up there .
these places , these origins , represent governance gaps .
but as i said earlier , this kind of logic applies across the board for infectious diseases , and it ought to .
( applause )
horses &apos; hearing is very important .
you stop by a wall , and start painting on that wall .
we had relay races with condoms , we had children &apos;s condom-blowing championship .
so we at the hebrew university , about 10 years ago , decided to focus on probably the most important biomaterial for humans , which is collagen .
the ripples of the personal dna revolution may be hard to predict , but one thing is certain : revolutions don &apos;t go backwards , and dna technology is already spreading faster than our imagination .
i think it would be interesting to see what everyone did with a project like this .
it &apos;s a dream . and it became a dream also .
this is data from the congressional budget office showing its most realistic forecast of what would happen if current situations and expectations and trends are extended .
sunlight is the best disinfectant .
it motivates me to make sure that i stay on the right path .
i &apos;m showing here venus , earth and mars — three planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size , but only one of which is really a good place to live .
i think it &apos;s extremely important that we have sustainable transport and sustainable energy production .
now , i should pause and say , what do i mean by puzzle ?
as he said , i was co-inventor of the furby .
well it allowed you to do that .
this is morocco last year in the atlas mountains , training in preparation for some high altitude jumps .
primates emerge from jungles , as tarsiers first , becoming lemurs not much later .
and those are frozen solid , and they &apos;re shipped to seattle .
( applause ) from malta , madagascar , thailand , vietnam , jordan , egypt , israel , as far north as alaska and as far south as new zealand .
what &apos;s ended up happening over the past few decades is the kind of coverage that you had as a head of state or as a great celebrity is now being applied to you every day by all these people who are tweeting , blogging , following you , watching your credit scores and what you do to yourself .
sand , water , all the equipment we don &apos;t need anymore .
now my husband , chris , and i love this show .
that is , you have to decide what that other person expects of you .
thank you .
finally , there &apos;s one of evening primrose that bjorn rorslett from norway sent me — fantastic hidden pattern .
but i wasn &apos;t there for nine months at a time like the filipino seafarers , who , when i asked them to describe their job to me , called it &quot; &quot; dollar for homesickness . &quot; &quot; they had good salaries , but theirs is still an isolating and difficult life in a dangerous and often difficult element .
what it &apos;s all about is the selective representations of things that are important to the brain .
the animal could be a cow , lamb , or even something more exotic .
put that another way — of all of them who test positive — so here they are , the individuals involved — less than one in 100 actually have the disease .
and then there &apos;s this one : &quot; if there &apos;s grass on the field , play ball . &quot;
he &apos;s one of more than 175 so-called terrorists , for whom the fbi has created hollywood endings .
i think this film is one of the hardest watches of modern times , &quot; &quot; the road . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a beautiful piece of filmmaking , but everything is desolate , everything is dead .
so over the 200 years of whaling , when we were busy killing and removing these carcasses from the oceans , we likely altered the rate and geographic distribution of these whale falls that would descend into deep oceans , and as a result , probably led to a number of extinctions of species that were most specialized and dependent on these carcasses for their survival .
and i &apos;m not saying there was no pair-bonding going on .
president obama understands that .
women are especially vulnerable to recruitment malpractices .
but the problem with relying on rules and incentives is that they demoralize professional activity , and they demoralize professional activity in two senses .
my mental illness — well , i &apos;m not even going to talk about my mental illness .
whether it be a mother , a daughter , a sister , a friend or a grandmother .
this pig at 10 : 06 was having a heart attack .
there are three featured in the film .
information visibility drives efficiency .
and in this , you &apos;d have like a — something that looks like a cloud , and it is a cloud at the same time .
i photographed him at the scene of the crime at the snake river in idaho .
so here &apos;s the thing . it sounds like a simple question .
but it &apos;s the best music making , like this .
or the sensual feeling .
then i thought , &quot; &quot; wait a minute , what am i doing ? &quot; &quot; a book is not only a neat way of collecting and storing information , it &apos;s a series of layers .
&quot; &quot; a maimed monument and a maimed mall for a maimed collection . &quot; &quot; almost four decades later , how will this building expand for a new progressive program ?
so that was the low-fear group .
but that would sort of be jumping to the middle of the story , and i &apos;m not going to show you that polished video .
we can see everything on wikipedia .
first , i &apos;m going to fly you over the rings .
and they all seemed to be ok .
so if you give just to one side or the other , you &apos;ll have tension or friction .
some of the organisms see all of the reality , others see just part of the reality , and some see none of the reality , only fitness .
calvin washington was convicted of capital murder .
but actually , the most exciting part of this new manufacturing revolution goes much beyond productivity .
we &apos;re going to do it non-invasively using mri .
but she ate it .
yellow . blue . red .
and one of those i &apos;d like to share with you today .
we have the tendency for people to go for 50 dollars now over waiting a month , but not if that decision is far in the future .
( laughter ) i recommend you all do this .
both parties know exactly what the speaker means , and the speaker knows the listener knows that the speaker knows that the listener knows , etc . , etc .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , so i &apos;ll go ahead and i &apos;ll click on that , which reveals , for me , all the issues in which lance armstrong &apos;s been a part of .
she &apos;s putting electrodes on his head so that we can monitor the electrical activity in john &apos;s brain as he races around the track .
imagine you &apos;re learning to play tennis and you want to decide where the ball is going to bounce as it comes over the net towards you .
but i &apos;d heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time , so how did the good and bad go together ?
the dark side of the web is allergic to the light .
i mixed them up , heated them , cooled them down , and i got 50 billion little smiley faces floating around in a single drop of water .
and then i was also surprised by the city &apos;s propensity for kindness and care as opposed to indifference or worse .
now we may think that &apos;s good or bad , but in either case it &apos;s real .
ah , avaricious heaven !
i think this one here , there &apos;s a pop song that really describes philippe starck for me , you know , this is like you know , this is like puppy love , you know , this is cool right ?
i can &apos;t tell , nor can any of our algorithms , but in the case of a driver assistance system , that means it can &apos;t take action , because again , if it presses the brakes unexpectedly , that &apos;s completely unacceptable .
in the past , before air conditioning , we had thick walls .
and overlying this is the skin drape , which is a hugely complex three-dimensional structure — taking right-angled bends here and there , having thin areas like the eyelids , thick areas like the cheek , different colors .
the phantasmagoria , the actual experience that we try to understand and organize through narrative , varies from place to place .
thank you .
( laughter ) ( applause ) shameless . shameless . shameless . ( applause )
and we created the san fernando institute for applied media .
but the editor pointed out that we could not have &quot; &quot; present &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; presence &quot; &quot; in the same sentence .
well what percentage of those bombs do you think actually landed inside the 700-acre perimeter of the plant ?
this is my collaborator ryota kanai .
my name is rashid , and i never been at ted before , you know what i &apos;m saying .
not only that , but some really bad scientists want to do some experiments on him , and they &apos;re looking for him .
many of you don &apos;t think of this yet , but the ocean will be in your pocket .
and i was actually rowing for my school here until this fateful day , and i flipped over right in front of the entire school .
and i sought out the most remote places .
moreover , once we can do that , we can actually activate specific neurons or we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those neurons .
and i feel like i &apos;m actually depriving them of information by telling them this , at which point i usually panic and spit out the first thing that comes to my mind , which is , i have no idea what i &apos;m doing .
meds don &apos;t equal medical care .
my job is to actually make sure that we make progress on all of these disorders .
exploring with them the forest canopy has been one of the most lovely things of my existence on earth .
i normally teach courses on how to rebuild states after war .
and even so , you can still see the shadows of these great beasts in our current ecosystems .
thank you .
they want to hunker down , they want to look to the future .
but that &apos;s changed .
and the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
slightly embarrassing admission : even when i was a kid , i used to have these little spy books , and i would , like , see what everybody was doing in my neighborhood and log it down .
but the challenge is , again , they don &apos;t get much value , because they can &apos;t afford anything more than the scooter .
designs were refined and developed with 150 older people and their families before the service was launched earlier this year .
but just the technological savings in heavy trucks can get to two-thirds .
there was no one there to look at treatment approaches .
do you remember , 20 years ago , no one had ever heard of west nile fever ?
we landed with 40 kilos .
what am i doing with the architecture ?
and how much will these samples be worth ?
this is actually a picture of the printing mechanism for another machine of his , called the difference engine no. 2 , which he never built , but which the science museum did build in the &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s .
we &apos;ve been around as homo sapiens — that &apos;s a rather generous definition , sapiens — for perhaps a quarter of a million years , a quarter of a million .
it happens . right ?
you and i — even you in the back — we live in three dimensions of space .
which is also increased when we &apos;re with our women friends .
i was active in the youth ministry .
right now , profounder &apos;s right at the very beginning , and it &apos;s very palpable ; it &apos;s very clear to me , that it &apos;s just a vessel , it &apos;s just a tool .
there is lots of showing off .
but finding me busy , she fled , with the dawn .
well , in this , there &apos;s personalization all the way .
but instead of having constant accidental or mindless interruptions , we &apos;re now only creating conscious interruptions , so we &apos;re doing two things here .
( music ) but , what if ...
for multiple defenders , we can look at how the player &apos;s moving and predict the shot type .
well , if you take the informational , panpsychist view , she certainly has complicated information processing and integration , so the answer is very likely yes , she is conscious .
and we had this mantra : &quot; human . kind . be both . &quot;
a great way to start , i think , with my view of simplicity is to take a look at ted . here you are , understanding why we &apos;re here , what &apos;s going on with no difficulty at all .
that &apos;s because it &apos;s cheaper .
unfortunately , this is often lacking or inefficient in a lot of developing countries .
and i was driving home from work , and a truck was coming the opposite direction , came over into my lane , ran over the top of my car and his axle tore my arm off .
you look busy . how are you ?
it has no meaning , just — desoto discovers the mississippi , and it &apos;s a desoto discovering the mississippi .
actually any primate will do that .
and how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality .
and so , together with my colleagues , i &apos;ve called for a global conversation about the technology that i co-invented , so that we can consider all of the ethical and societal implications of a technology like this .
you can see it in the way we raise our young kids .
and instead that money went to underwrite the wars in yugoslavia and line the pockets of unscrupulous individuals .
tell my wife i love her very much she knows . &quot; &quot; ground control to major tom , your circuit &apos;s dead , there &apos;s something wrong .
( applause ) you have to separate fact from bias , right .
and that &apos;s going to impact how it &apos;s going to evolve .
we &apos;re going to share lots of things with people , but nothing &apos;s going to happen until we risk putting those ideas into action .
and that this , of course , one of the themes for us is that we think that candor and brutal honesty is critical to us collectively being great parents .
enjoying it so far ? ( laughs ) ( laughter ) sorry , i just feel such a , i feel such a cassandra here . ( laughter )
on the one hand , we can choose between a new golden age where information is more universally available than it &apos;s ever been in human history , where we all have the answers to our questions at our fingertips .
after a kind of long , awkward period of time , steve broke the silence .
don &apos;t black-box history . don &apos;t check your principles at the door .
( applause ) danit peleg : thank you , rebecca .
yet each pales to insignificance with the completion of that magnificent accomplishment of twenty-first-century technology , the digital superhighway .
i convinced my 10th grade english teacher to allow me to do my book report on stephen king &apos;s &quot; &quot; misery &quot; &quot; as an animated short . ( laughter ) and i kept making comics .
that word , &quot; &quot; good , &quot; &quot; and the number 6.8 and the discovery that &apos;s behind it have changed my life .
the thing is , they see their lives and the risks they run decidedly differently .
( laughter ) here &apos;s me , just so we &apos;re even .
we have to take matters into our own hands , not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone — and that &apos;s the hard part — but by improving our own .
i &apos;ve made clear again and again and again that i go to sleep every morning thinking about what i can do for the american people .
little by little it gets colder until eventually it approaches absolute zero .
peers are giving and doing things that are incredibly expensive for companies to do .
when i was a graduate student , it was one of the most exciting times to be working in nanotechnology .
they run some more of the numbers , and at the end of about three or four weeks , turns out they have mapped the exact trajectory of this satellite around the earth , just from listening to this one little signal , going off on this little side hunch that they &apos;d been inspired to do over lunch one morning .
and what went wrong ?
this is sometimes called &quot; &quot; the mama bear effect . &quot; &quot; like a mama bear defending her cubs , when we advocate for others , we can discover our own voice .
and you &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ve got to take this . &quot; &quot; the really beautiful thing is , you know how when somebody &apos;s sitting next to you , sometimes they can sort of hear a little bit of the caller .
so we talked to some sources in hama who we had been back and forth with on twitter , and we asked them about this , and the bridge was interesting to us because it was something we could identify .
those are the ideas where there is no argument in a society , but you are not able to implement those things .
i do not want to have my conclusions tested . &quot; &quot; it feels so much more comfortable simply to lay down the law .
in this respect , the data has gone from a stock to a flow , from something that is stationary and static to something that is fluid and dynamic .
intimacy for us means a lot of different things .
&quot; &quot; if we accept the theory of evolution , then the first dawn of synthesis of life must consist in the production of forms intermediate between the inorganic and the organic world , or between the non-living and living world , forms which possess only some of the rudimentary attributes of life &quot; &quot; — so , the ones i just discussed — &quot; &quot; to which other attributes will be slowly added in the course of development by the evolutionary actions of the environment . &quot; &quot; so we start simple , we make some structures that may have some of these characteristics of life , and then we try to develop that to become more lifelike .
that was his idea of a performance-enhancing drug .
the worship of those we hate .
so i &apos;m like , whoa .
because once john committed himself to putting his life back together — first physically , then emotionally , and then spiritually — he found that there were very few resources available to someone who has attempted to end their life in the way that he did .
second of all , i &apos;ll bet even you people who are untrained can see the difference , and we see here an st segment elevation right after this sharp line .
child : i think he is going to take that one .
tg : i believe that beauty is a basic service .
the bonobo , although shorter than us and their arms still longer , is more upright , just as we are .
i got into it because i wanted to help people feel better .
you don &apos;t need this for what you can get in wal-mart ; you need this for what makes you unique .
i was just so tired .
we dug and dug and dug , and there wasn &apos;t another bone around .
researchers at emory gave children a simple &quot; &quot; what do you know &quot; &quot; test .
hollywood gathers around power tables , and the valley gathers around power tables .
this is actually just a picture of the earth at night , and i &apos;m just putting it up because i think it &apos;s pretty .
and what we &apos;re looking for is the tiny dimming of light that is caused by a planet passing in front of one of these stars and blocking some of that starlight from getting to us .
we are but two threads cut from the same cloth .
and we ought to give it to them .
in particular , it tells us why we see immorality .
it &apos;s 40,000 dollars to build the university of pittsburgh medical school .
so how are they going to divide up breadwinning and caregiving responsibilities ?
who just turned out the lights ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) &quot; what &apos;s that over there ? &quot; &quot; what ? &quot;
it would be a personalized chip just for you .
we can &apos;t overestimate the amount of despair that we are generating with places like this .
( laughter ) and we stop listening .
suddenly , we &apos;re back in that trishaw again and we &apos;re bumping off the broad , well-lit streets ; and we &apos;re reminded , really , of the first law of travel and , therefore , of life : you &apos;re only as strong as your readiness to surrender .
i think there is outer truth and there &apos;s inner truth .
and the second thing it does , and it gives us a very clear direction of travel for new therapies — i mean , you don &apos;t need to be a rocket scientist to know what to do here .
it &apos;s not true .
it &apos;s very much like the rutting of mammals , including humans , you know , sorting out our differences , but gentler , no biting allowed .
it &apos;s a scraper bike ; it &apos;s called — from oakland .
no , well , i guess when i was a girl , we didn &apos;t really have a name for that either .
it took us about 10 minutes to climb up to the top of that dune , which goes to show why they had to move to a safer location .
so i started taking a look at them . ( music ) i saw one of them that featured a kitten and her mom and wishing her mom a happy mother &apos;s day .
and information will tell her when to go to market with which product .
i &apos;m suffering from gallery fatigue .
( applause ) thank you so much .
journalists , this is off the record ; it &apos;s embargoed .
they warned us earlier that every imaginable mishap has occurred to speakers up here on the stage .
here , this animation is zooming in onto our solar system .
i have friends who are very confident they can do certain things , but i realize that they overestimate their own competence .
but when you want to do something new , you have to apply the physics approach .
why does everyone get rid of me ?
i know when i had a job that required two bus rides and a subway ride every morning , i used to go to the library on weekends to get stuff to read .
you say , &quot; &quot; well , of course i can &apos;t write today , because i &apos;m giving a tedtalk and i have five media interviews , and then i &apos;m going to a cocktail party and then i &apos;ll be drunk after that .
there is more energy flowing through , per gram per second , than anything that we have any other experience with .
now , you can see how this could be a problem , especially because the government considers so much of what it does secret .
but usually that is linked to very strong social disparities .
we still think it is pristine .
any child can say , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m a tiger , &quot; &quot; pretend to be a tiger .
well , this is a lot of water , and again , we &apos;re mining water and using it to grow food , and today , if you travel down further down the colorado , it dries up completely and no longer flows into the ocean .
at the end of that time , i went off to australia , about 20 years ago .
as he was nearing his death , his disciples and followers kept asking him , &quot; &quot; what &apos;s the secret ?
we can start with mongolia , or as some call it , mine-golia .
so , let me just tell you how that goes .
sandy &apos;s story was about the return to the bronx of supreme court justice sonia sotomayor .
and it has not been the case for most of modern american history .
what if travel were like a magnificent buffet of local experiences ?
we don &apos;t know you &apos;re there , so it &apos;s kind of nice to say &quot; &quot; hello &quot; &quot; first .
we have superstar bankers .
( laughter ) and some of you guys are entrepreneurs , etc . , whatever .
this is what it looks like .
and a year after that , we did conquer it .
and so , i want to give you a greeting , as from a chimpanzee in the forests of tanzania — ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh !
and if you manipulate the speed of this rotor , you are actually able to crack the rotor and eventually even have the centrifuge explode .
and from alabama to alaska , a group of women who had always wanted to do something that mattered alongside the best of the best , and to make a difference for their country , answered that call to serve .
( video ) luke massella : i was really sick . i could barely get out of bed .
just when we know we need to be learning to live on the surface of our planet , off the power of sun , wind and waves , we are frantically digging to get at the dirtiest , highest-emitting stuff imaginable .
the other reason is this amazing bush glows .
now , as you gain elevation your iq goes down — ( laughter ) but your emotional affect goes up , which is great for having a mythic experience , whether you want to or not .
ag : we are getting more support .
so the effect that this stroke could have on mario &apos;s body could be the fact that he couldn &apos;t be able to control the left side of his body .
i left san francisco , where i live , on monday , and i was getting on the plane for this conference .
you can burst bubbles .
now , when we think about changing human nature , the first thing that comes to mind are these human modification technologies — growth hormone therapy , cosmetic surgery , stimulants like ritalin , adderall , anti-depressants , anabolic steroids , artificial hearts .
but of course , that only works when we have both of these components .
i &apos;m sure that in this room there are , like , 15 other wonderful stories of nonprofits doing spectacular work .
the modern healthcare sector has totally collapsed .
instead of crying or ceasing our play , instead of waking my parents , with all the negative consequences for me , a smile spread across her face and she scrambled back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn — ( laughter ) with one broken leg .
it &apos;s kind of an extraordinary story when you realize that this is twice as common as homicide and actually more common as a source of death than traffic fatalities in this country .
and i started thinking about a counseling program .
and what &apos;s really , really great about being here is i &apos;m sure that the questions that you guys have are very , very different than the questions that i think up myself .
step back , give your mother a break , okay .
cetaceans and primates have also an autobiographical self to a certain degree .
we &apos;re not born craving whoppers or skittles .
there &apos;s increased hunting and fishing for commercial purposes .
we said that if you stop to swap your battery more than 50 times a year we start paying you money because it &apos;s an inconvenience .
so what you can see now is that the ferrofluid has formed spikes .
&quot; &quot; oh , it &apos;s very easy . it &apos;s the western world and it &apos;s the developing world , &quot; &quot; they say .
and how futile seemed the words of advice to me from great british veteran conductor sir colin davis who said , &quot; &quot; conducting , charles , is like holding a small bird in your hand .
it &apos;s not in their taste , really . it &apos;s not in their texture .
why not apply that to our looking at paintings ?
( laughter ) he had no idea what that was , ( laughter ) so i spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans , and i walked out of the store — truth ! — with the best-fitting jeans i had ever had .
what does the inside of your computer actually look like ?
and artists who were formerly constrained can now do things that were never , ever possible for them before .
because of the overhanging leaves and branches , you &apos;ll notice that the understory is very dark , it &apos;s very still .
so you have to find rocks of the right age , depending on what your interests are .
can you place that down into the floor ?
let me start by asking you a question , just with a show of hands : who has an iphone ?
i was about 10 years old on a camping trip with my dad in the adirondack mountains , a wilderness area in the northern part of new york state .
it &apos;s twice the range of any electric motorcycle .
is it the exposure ? we have professors from mit , berkeley , stanford , indian institute of science who come and teach our children lots of scientific formulas , experiments , much beyond the classroom .
narrator : on january 24th , apple computer will introduce macintosh .
i &apos;d spoken to all the experts .
that &apos;s another argument for why we need to step into the lab and really measure the impact of technology on the brain .
as it turns out , these two abilities are also essential for all of us to function well in our society .
and just as one example of the kind of thing you can do , you can take a complex network , use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense network .
and i went there a few months ago — photos are still there — and it was missing a piece of the eye .
and of course , there &apos;s nothing special about cromwell or bladders — you have just breathed in a nitrogen atom that passed through the right lung of the third iguanodon to the left of the tall cycad tree .
both poets , writers , creatives with a long history of community work behind us , and big , huge dreams of a family in front of us , we shared a lot of things in common , but we were also incredibly different .
early visions of wireless power actually were thought of by nikola tesla basically about 100 years ago .
so where do we go from here ?
and when we go to cop15 at the end of this year we can &apos;t stop thinking of padding co2 .
one of the most impressive things about what some , perhaps 10 , of the speakers have been talking about is the realization , as you listen to them carefully , that they &apos;re not saying : well , this is what we should do ; this is what i would like you to do .
i think that &apos;s rather creepy , actually . why would a neighborhood have a logo ?
all of these new technologies just offer tremendous opportunities for us to be able to impact the individuals with autism , but yet we have a long way to go .
so now i ask you , how do i feel when the time finally comes and there &apos;s another dark night , sometime between midnight and 2 a.m. ?
the most surprising thing that i &apos;ve learned while running this contest is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research .
not quite the whole truth . anyway .
and so , the place that we took it to was this place called a brine pool , which is in the northern part of the gulf of mexico .
but unfortunately he gets sick . he gets really sick at the end of the story .
egyptians on social media were wondering , &quot; if tunisia did it , why can &apos;t we ? &quot;
so why all the big deal about genetics ?
let &apos;s start with the global challenge of urbanization .
when she gives birth to the first girl child , first daughter , she is sad .
physicists have told us for a long time that the metal of that train looks solid but really it &apos;s mostly empty space with microscopic particles zipping around .
but i &apos;d also like to point out that the oceans are much more connected than we think .
that &apos;s why they don &apos;t know whether their mutual fund manager is taking 0.1 percent or 0.15 percent of their investment , but they clip coupons to save one dollar off of toothpaste .
and at that point , the universe mysteriously starts accelerating its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger-scale structure .
so this is jonathan . he &apos;s 37 years old . he has a master &apos;s degree .
so here , in wool , through a domestic feminine art , is the proof that the most famous postulate in mathematics is wrong .
we &apos;re now 6.8 billion people , and we &apos;re expected to be 9 billion people by 2050 .
i &apos;d just like to point out , if you look at the map of africa , it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape .
the fear is the child .
now , unfortunately , i don &apos;t have a solution to this problem , apart from recommending that more of us think about it .
ev : dark chocolate with almonds .
we all live in this fast-paced , digital world , but we still crave and desire something that &apos;s relatable .
when you look at the incredible work that my colleagues are doing all around the world and what they &apos;re finding , i believe that there are millions of undiscovered archaeological sites left to find .
now , if that organization had taken the time to observe deaf people , to observe the community , they would have realized their problem and perhaps they would have come up with a solution , something like a solar light , lighting up a secure pen to put them in at night to ensure their safety .
and i will start with a brief taster of what i ’ ve been about : a handful of films — nothing much , two feature films and a handful of short films .
when they hear about these kinds of things happening to us , they say , &apos; why do you take it ?
drawn just right , still not funny enough .
abed then showed me a picture of his mashed truck , and said that the crash was the fault of a bus driver in the left lane who did not let him pass .
at each stage , we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we &apos;re trying to create a process that &apos;s extremely robust that you can see in a minute .
and this meant i could ski over very thin ice , and if i fell through , it wasn &apos;t the end of the world .

ks : seeing the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of applications — it helps you see why this is significant , what the potential is .
meanwhile , i use these scores as blueprints to translate into sculptural forms like this , that function still in the sense of being a three-dimensional weather visualization , but now they &apos;re embedding the visual matrix of the musical score , so it can actually be read as a musical score .

you might argue that the last time it happened — and that &apos;s what housman felt coming and what churchill felt too — was that when power passed from the old nations , the old powers of europe , across the atlantic to the new emerging power of the united states of america — the beginning of the american century .
so we do that , and you &apos;re happy , we feel like sellouts , so we start experimenting again and we push the pendulum back and back and forth and back and forth we &apos;ve gone for the last 300 years , and certainly for the last 30 years .
so , for example in iraq , you know , the war zone , there is roadside bombs . currently you send these remotely controlled vehicles that are armed .

now , it doesn &apos;t look like our home planet .
they &apos;re now down to well under a dollar a piece , and they &apos;re going into all kinds of devices .
i was working on the cranial collections , and it just struck me as ironic that here were people coming to see this gory , primitive , savage culture that they were almost fantasizing about and creating without really understanding what they were seeing , and all the while these vast — i mean hundreds of thousands of skulls in our museums , all across europe and the states — were kind of upholding this enlightenment pursuit of scientific rationality .
obviously the church weren &apos;t very happy about this , and they tried to suppress it , but what they hadn &apos;t counted on was technology , and then they had the printing press , which suddenly enabled these ideas to spread cheaply , far and fast , and people would come together in coffee houses , discuss the ideas , plot revolution .
one of the judges , lord atkin , described it like this : you must take care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbor .

his name was sven arrhenius . he was swedish , and he said , if you double the co2 level in the atmosphere , which he thought might — this is in 1900 — the temperature ought to go up about 5.5 degrees , he calculated .
it falls over , but it falls over like a rag doll , basically .
that &apos;s the percentage we recycle .
what are all the possible ways that we can think of to get everybody in the middle of a musical experience , not just listening , but making music ?
so that was an immense shock for me , and it was an immense shock for many people , but it was also something that , over the following several days , created a complete political meltdown in my country .

that &apos;s what &apos;s happened to america . look around .
they made it , but they eventually published a simplified design .
watch this bird fly across in front of us . the car reacts to that .
but i knew what he meant , because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures of flowers in a garden and then , basically , index them in a computer system , such that it would appear that there was a real robot , when there wasn &apos;t .
and then we also see this movement forward from dollars and cents .
they started very well . they used the aid well .
you notice that jim cameron is sitting in a seat .
well , this is random mutation .
so i teamed up with my good friend ricardo cabello , also known as mr. doob , who &apos;s a much better programmer than i am , and he made this amazing flash drawing tool .
so as businesspeople , as consumers , as patients , as citizens , we have a responsibility , i think , to spend more time focusing on our critical thinking skills .
i &apos;m here today because i think we actually need hackers .
unfortunately , at the same time as we &apos;re discovering this treasure trove of potentially habitable worlds , our own planet is sagging under the weight of humanity .

now together , through our supply chain , with partners , we &apos;ve managed to certify 35 million hectares of forestry .
but if you carefully look at the right-hand side of this image , we saw the lander still there , but it had bounced .
you can see i don &apos;t do much . i &apos;m just standing there , again with my eyes closed , and other people are molding me , evidential .
we basically are taking the same satellite phone parts , or the same parts that are in your computer , chips .
some of you , i &apos;m sure , will be familiar with this .
this experience taught me to empathize more with my patients , and especially those with retinal diseases .
so this kettle here is an example of one where it actually has two reservoirs .
we explore ruins of palestinian villages , and we discuss how they became ruins .
if you &apos;re poor , you &apos;re more likely to get malaria .
these were the days when we had dolly and girlfriend magazines .
i am more patient with love . i am more relaxed .
instead of taking a single , high quality image , we could take a videostream of individually noisier frames , but then we could recombine all of those frames together into very high-quality images using sophisticated pixel processing techniques here on the ground , at a cost of one one hundredth a traditional system .
ten years ago , i wrote a book which i entitled &quot; &quot; our final century ? &quot; &quot; question mark .

now mark my words , it &apos;s only a matter of time before we &apos;re going to be able to perform a google-like search and see a cumulative picture of our reputation capital .
these population studies that we &apos;ve done have created tons of miracle drugs that have saved millions of lives , but the problem is that health care is treating us as averages , not unique individuals , because at the end of the day , the patient is not the same thing as the population who are studied . that &apos;s what &apos;s leading to the guesswork .
this is a remote center at the university of washington .

but there are more and more technologies , software and processes today that are breaking down those barriers .
and i want to get you comfortable with this idea , so imagine the things i &apos;m going to show you , these technologies , and this attitude that says , &quot; &quot; we &apos;re going to reuse this .

so an illustration again , gives you a feeling for scale .
the neuron uses its natural protein-making machinery to fabricate these little light-sensitive proteins and install them all over the cell , like putting solar panels on a roof , and the next thing you know , you have a neuron which can be activated with light .
they said and object like jupiter would make a drop like this in the star &apos;s light , but they were also saying it was giant .
we can look at the impacts of storms on sea salt particles in the atmosphere .
then you categorize it , then you file it , put that file in a filing cabinet , put it in your office and you can make a living doing it .
actually , i think the bad news about kin selection is just that it means that this kind of compassion is naturally deployed only within the family .
and lastly , perhaps most importantly , cities , with the incredible wealth of relations that they enable , could be the ideal places for human happiness to flourish .
the stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past are now part of common culture — outside the american bible belt , anyway — ( laughter ) but most people , even those who are familiar with evolution , aren &apos;t mindful that even more time lies ahead .

enlightened self-interest , because if that economic divergence continues for another 40 years , combined with social integration globally , it will build a nightmare for our children .

i see hope . i see happiness in their faces .
an ant colony consists of sterile female workers — those are the ants you see walking around — and then one or more reproductive females who just lay the eggs .
and i also feel softer because i &apos;m not scared of being vulnerable .
awful , really awful .
remember that , when they developed those hacking skills , their moral compass had not yet developed .
in the years since huxley , science has learned a lot about brain activity , but the relationship between brain activity and conscious experiences is still a mystery .
so we celebrated .

and they laughed at him . for 20 years , they called this guy &quot; &quot; the mosquito man . &quot; &quot; but he ran an experiment in people , right ? he had this hypothesis , and he tested it in people .
what did get me moving was a social interaction .
the extremism on one side begets extremism on the other , a fact we should have learned many , many times over , and both extremes in this debate are just wrong .
if you look 50 years into the future , the way we probably will be making energy is probably one of these three , with some wind , with some other things , but these are going to be the base load energy drivers .
i want people to understand that design is so much more than cute chairs , that it is first and foremost everything that is around us in our life .

well , we were confined though , limited , i should rather say , for several reasons that it &apos;s not worth explaining , to endoscopy only , of the many other options we had , and with a 4mm camera attached to it , we were successful in documenting and taking some fragments of what it turns out to be a reddish color , black color , and there is some beige fragments that later on we ran a much more sophisticated exams , xrf , x-ray diffraction , and the results are very positive so far . it seems to indicate that indeed we have found some pigments , and since we know for sure

first , we &apos;ve got to be ready and willing to take experts on and dispense with this notion of them as modern-day apostles .
and what do they do with that money ?
and so , what we can see is that over the course of childhood and even into adolescence , both the cognitive system , our mind &apos;s ability to think about other minds , and the brain system that supports it are continuing , slowly , to develop .

and there was one more big soulful lesson , and that one i learned from albert einstein .
we were asked to undertake a study and investigate the potential of a site out in stratford in the olympic park .
and in that disconnected state , yeah , we can build factory farms with no windows , destroy marine life and use rape as a weapon of war .
darwin worried about the relationship between what he said and the truths of religion , but he could proceed , he could write books about his subject without having to say what the relationship was to the religious claims , and similarly , geologists increasingly could talk about it .

what if instead we just got really curious about what was happening in our momentary experience ?
jim cameron actually photographed the real titanic .
glucose is very important , and we know it &apos;s involved with diabetes .
in the past , i talked about it .
forty of the 50 most dangerous cities in the world are right here in latin america , 13 in brazil , and the most dangerous of all , it &apos;s san pedro sula , honduras &apos; second city , with a staggering homicide rate of 187 murders per 100,000 people .
and the result of that is , we &apos;re going to generate 83,000 new jobs , four billion dollars a year in annual income , and reduce the co2 emissions by 174 million tons a year .
so now we have a whole extended bacteria family , filled with virus sleeper cells .
as a quarter of the world population is influenced by it , you &apos;d be wise to do something about that .
so we documented this invention step by step on a website for inventors called instructables , in the hope that somebody would make it even better .
and this is so powerful that when they tweak their stats , when they say your crops wilt after eight hours , or after six hours , or after 24 hours , it changes the life cycle of some 70 million people during the day .
mark lynch , he &apos;s an amazing teacher and he &apos;s still a dear friend of mine , and i was 14 or 15 , and i walked into his comic book class halfway through the course , and i was so excited , i was beaming .
thank you .
so when the children see this , they say , &quot; &quot; ah ! acceleration , &quot; &quot; remembering back four months when they did their cars sideways , and they start measuring to find out what kind of acceleration it is .
so we started out trying to figure out . how do we get to 10 cents ?
they are less likely to see a therapist , less likely to be diagnosed with depression , less likely to be taking prescription medication .
it &apos;s not permanently in the exclusive economic zones of these five central american countries , but it moves with the season .
&quot; until you can get home ? &quot;
we &apos;re not just talking about a few pages of ones and zeros .
now is the time to create change in this industry and to push it into a sustainable direction .
the first component of the story that i thought was essential , however , was to give readers a sense of appreciation for the ocean animals that they were eating .
it was three steps .
so that plan was going really well , except the coding part , and then one morning a few months ago , i woke up to the news that the wife of a certain presidential candidate had given a speech that — ( laughter ) ( applause ) that sounded eerily like a speech given by one of my other faves , michelle obama .
bina rothblatt : it &apos;s been really an exciting journey , and i would have never thought that at the time , but we started making goals and setting those goals and accomplishing things , and before you knew it , we just keep going up and up and we &apos;re still not stopping , so it &apos;s great .
and most importantly , if the staircase is real , it explains the persistent undercurrent of dissatisfaction in modern life .
( video ) pilot : release our fire .
we can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death , seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
who was here or has otherwise seen hans rosling &apos;s talk ?
kyoto protocol system .
so what is open hardware ?
number one : we have to start with digital media literacy , and clearly it must have a gendered lens .
we think about a little boy trying to get to sleep .
this is a beautiful quote that i found — we &apos;re talking about serendipity there — from alexander fleming : &quot; &quot; when i woke up just after dawn on september 28 , 1928 , i certainly didn &apos;t plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world &apos;s first antibiotic . &quot; &quot; now , the explorers of the world of the atom did not intend to invent the transistor .
what if you could make them fun , attractive , clean , environmentally friendly ?
the ecliptic , which is the path of the sun , moon , and planets correspond to an offset circle .
i can tell you that the data on the number of children per woman is surprisingly good in all countries .
believing in each other , really being sure when push comes to shove that each one of us can do amazing things in the world , that is what can make our stories into love stories and our collective story into one that continually perpetuates hope and good things for all of us .
i think the headline in the new york times was , &quot; &quot; are you packing it on ?
let universality make way for plurality .
they range from 450 million years ago to the last , the k-t , number four , but the biggest of all was the p , or the permian extinction , sometimes called the mother of all mass extinctions .
freeways .
it looks like a little of string pearls basically — in fact , three strings of pearls .
and the brain specializes for it .
when i travel through megacities from end to end — it takes hours and days — i experience the tragedy of extreme disparity within the same geography .
see those hands there ? these are not built for farming .
players are shown pairs of urban scenes , and they &apos;re asked to choose which one is more beautiful , quiet and happy .
and katy perry drinks her morning coffee out of an amber owl .
well , i eventually got to the rhode island school of design .
&apos;we &apos;ve got to case the joint .
and many , many things at google have come out of that , such as orkut and also google news .
as wealth goes up in a society , the suicide rate goes up instead of down .
the fact is no government in the world , with the exception of a few , like that of idi amin , can seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule .
( laughter ) so i &apos;m listening to all this , you know , and i &apos;m like , is this guy for real ? is he making some of this up ?
it &apos;s something like this : and i had blocks in the pyramid , and the cornerstones being industriousness and enthusiasm , working hard and enjoying what you &apos;re doing , coming up to the apex , according to my definition of success .
and so the question is , &quot; &quot; why is this happening ? &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not being imposed by fiat from above .
and in fact , when you &apos;re turning around , and you &apos;re looking inside the house , and you &apos;re looking for this stuff , this is where you look first , right ?
what does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time ?
they have a broad trans-ideological appeal , and because we want them actually to happen , we figured out ways to do them that do not require much , if any , federal legislation , and can , indeed , be done administratively or at a state level .
we have great examples of that , unfortunately .
wwb : wind , water , birds — stochastic natural sounds composed of lots of individual random events , all of it very healthy , all of it sound that we evolved to over the years .
they watched their children change and they had no idea how to help them .
thank you for that reaction .
whatever it is you are struggling to remember , it is not poised on the tip of your tongue , not even lurking in some obscure corner of your spleen .
and we &apos;re now in a very strange sort of twilight zone , where no one quite knows what &apos;s worked , or what doesn &apos;t .
( laughter ) what is a woman without a clitoris supposed to do with her life ?
the life cycle impact of that lettuce is astronomical .
bring it back up .
yet authorities in countries like the united states , the united kingdom and many other democracies are seeking to use the law to either weaken or outright ban strong encryption , because the bad guys are using it , too .
and not only that , that mycelium connects different individuals in the forest , individuals not only of the same species but between species , like birch and fir , and it works kind of like the internet .
so i wanted to create a new kind of medicine , in order to create a new kind of relationship between the patient and the treatment .
that &apos;s how it works .
and two days later i came to do my next emergency shift , and that &apos;s when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office .
the way i like to put this is : one idea . ideas are meant to be shared , so one idea can serve one world , one market .
so go ahead , ask yourself , what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail ?
one day in rehab someone , started talking about surfing and all these guys who &apos;d never surfed before said , &quot; &quot; hey , let &apos;s go . &quot; &quot; and they went surfing .
the struggle between for and against is the mind &apos;s worst disease . &quot; &quot; now unfortunately , it &apos;s a disease that has been caught by many of the world &apos;s leaders .
in order to sustain our work into the future , we use technology centers where we partner with local universities and colleges to take the technology to them , whereby they then can help us with digital preservation of their heritage sites , and at the same time , it gives them the technology to benefit from in the future .
but this has come as a great boon for them .
( audio ) natalia rybczynski : yeah , i had someone call me &quot; &quot; dr. dead things . &quot; &quot; latif nasser : and i think she &apos;s particularly interesting because of where she digs that stuff up , way above the arctic circle in the remote canadian tundra .
a child &apos;s playstation today is more powerful than a military supercomputer from 1996 .
and they said , &quot; &quot; jeez , you know , we think we could actually take a look at the slope of the doppler effect to figure out the points at which the satellite is closest to our antennae and the points at which it &apos;s farthest away .
again , we just take these lines and recursively replace them with the whole shape .
then , on december 26th last year , just two months ago , that underwater earthquake triggered the tsunami .
i use the garden , the soil , like it &apos;s a piece of cloth , and the plants and the trees , that &apos;s my embellishment for that cloth .
i might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday — that seemed pretty darn unlikely .
whereas before the farmer used to think local — meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market , eight to 10 kilometers away on average , and sell whatever they happened to have , without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was — now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market .
so each building has its own personality .
when muhammad told me his personal story , how his father , 55 years old , collapsed at home , had a cardiac arrest , and it took over an hour for an ambulance arrive , and he saw his father die in front of his eyes , he asked me , &quot; &quot; please start this in east jerusalem . &quot; &quot; i said to myself , i saw so much tragedy , so much hate , and it &apos;s not about saving jews . it &apos;s not about saving muslims .
but yet they &apos;re experiencing something so unbelievably pure , which is before the sound is actually happening .
camp two , another 2,000 feet higher up , what &apos;s called the western cwm .
some of them are not states anymore at all .
and this referendum would propose having those dollars go to law enforcement and safety .
i learned a lesson from it .
and this might be associated with some of the differences in health associated with cesarean birth , such as more asthma , more allergies , even more obesity , all of which have been linked to microbes now , and when you think about it , until recently , every surviving mammal had been delivered by the birth canal , and so the lack of those protective microbes that we &apos;ve co-evolved with might be really important for a lot of these different conditions that we now know involve the microbiome .
but not those babies — not yet .
and , of course , the heartbreaking , flip side of this study , is that they took the &quot; &quot; a students &quot; &quot; and told them they were &quot; &quot; d &apos;s . &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what happened at the end of that three-month period .
it &apos;s a spinning globe , the surface of which is entirely composed of the pictures and words and drawings of people that submitted to the time capsule .
i have started teaching part-time , and with my husband , who juggles several jobs , we &apos;ve opened a small bookshop .
they &apos;re not affronted by differences , they &apos;re fascinated by them , and that is a huge shift in mindset , and once you feel it , you want it to happen a lot more .
some of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores , a greater comfort level with the material , especially with the boys , that in going outside and playing , they aren &apos;t afraid to take on a double-digit multiplication problem — and also that the teachers are able to use these as assessment tools to better gauge how their students are understanding new material .
and what &apos;s worse , what they &apos;re learning there isn &apos;t even practically useful anymore .
so , back to mars .
those who embrace their roles and work to improve their performance grow , change and expand the self .
does the novel show us a way out ? i &apos;m not sure .
as a matter of fact , we think reaching 100 percent is very doable , even before the 2015 timeframe . in other parts of emerging countries , such as india and china , the progress has been good — has been solid , has been good . but in places that are not as developed , places like africa , latin america and other places in the world , the progress has been rather slow . as a matter of fact , i was just recently visiting south africa .
and again , i posted a conductor video , and we started accepting submissions .
they stand for numbers for a particular book .
is it different women who are doing the preserving and the radicalizing ?
( laughter ) behind the humor is the idea of making the cubicle more human . ) david kelley : so here &apos;s the final thing , complete with orange lighting that follows the sun across — that follows the tracks of the sun — across the sky .
( laughter ) so my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone — all races , all religions , all income and education levels .
and we have not had the other side of the argument fully aired so that people can draw their own conclusions .
but perhaps most heartbreaking of all are the stories of the abuse of even the most basic human rights , such as the young woman shown in this image here that are played out every day , sadly , even in the very institutions that were built to care for people with mental illnesses , the mental hospitals .
thank you .
it turns out , atrazine is the largest selling product for the largest chemical company in the world .
it is accepted that for such an aim , knowledge creation , interaction among people , face-to-face contact , it &apos;s important , and we agreed on that .
so a fundamental shift , and now you have environmentalists and economists like ed glaeser saying we are a destructive species .
well , it turns out that those cells used in that laboratory , they &apos;re male cells , and the animals used in the animal studies were male animals , and the clinical trials have been performed almost exclusively on men .
eight years later , when they discovered there was a plot to kill him , they dressed him up like a beggar and snuck him out of the country on horseback , and took the same trip that tamdin did .
first , because as i &apos;ve discussed on this stage before , i learned that the fbi has been monitoring my work .
does that mean that you think that the other things we think our brains are about — the dreaming , the yearning , the falling in love and all these things — are a kind of side show , an accident ?
chris anderson : i just have a couple of questions for you .
these are all complexity questions , and computer science tells us that these are very hard questions .
let &apos;s see what sweden has done .
and you say , &quot; &quot; if you were me , doc , what would you do ? &quot; &quot; and the doc says , &quot; &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot; &quot; and the result is — we call it &quot; &quot; patient autonomy , &quot; &quot; which makes it sound like a good thing , but it really is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision-making from somebody who knows something — namely , the doctor — to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions — namely , the patient .
it looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation .
follow the calculus tag on tumblr , and yes , you will see people complaining about calculus , but you &apos;ll also see people re-blogging those complaints , making the argument that calculus is interesting and beautiful , and here &apos;s a way in to thinking about the problem that you find unsolvable .
it &apos;s getting them wrong that is living .
these were the fears that danced in the imaginations of these poor men , and as it turned out , the fear they chose to listen to would govern whether they lived or died .
and roots and shoots is a program for hope .
and it has , but you also notice , right over there , that it has a very abstract image that it has still managed to recognize and cluster as horses .
we clearly can .
we &apos;ve got to get our hero , captain willard , to the mouth of the nung river so he can go pursue colonel kurtz .
well , they didn &apos;t . they didn &apos;t want to send their books .
so we developed a different approach .
well , surprisingly enough , amazingly enough , the anatomists had a very poor idea of the structure of the lung until very recently .
that implication was studied by boltzmann back in the 19th century .
to claim that he &apos;s &quot; &quot; not really nigerian , &quot; &quot; though , denies his experience in lagos , the rituals he practiced growing up , his relationship with family and friends .
this is peak fishing in a few seconds . the &apos; 60s .
night had fallen , and i went out under this great overturned saltshaker of stars , and i could see the tail lights of cars disappearing around the headlands 12 miles to the south .
last lesson , from a latin american : this is the great poet jorge luis borges .
i loved that i could hide within this shadow my own painted version , and it would be almost invisible until the light changed , and all of a sudden my shadow would be brought to the light .
doesn &apos;t mean that people who are in between don &apos;t experience racism , but it means that the closer you are to white on that spectrum , the better off you are .
well , most of you anyway .
okay , a few of you .
below the surface there is hard saline water .
and i decided that , in fact , i didn &apos;t really want to create complicated stuff .
so all of this money started pouring in , and all of this fame started pouring in .
and to help you , i &apos;ve got two things to leave you with , from two great philosophers , perhaps two of the greatest philosopher thinkers of the 20th century , one a mathematician and an engineer , and the other a poet .
and people in white hats sailing boats .
and so if you change the recipe , and you add things when you pour — so you add things to your liquid silk solution — where these things are enzymes or antibodies or vaccines , the self-assembly process preserves the biological function of these dopants .
i was a child , too young to understand the circumstances of my being there .
we gotta do something different . we gotta think radical .
( laughter ) . so they &apos;ve got a little bit of a sibling rivalry thing going on here .
it &apos;s in the developmental power of entrepreneurship , the ethical power of democracy .
and said , &quot; &quot; hi , i &apos;m trying to make a toaster .
i looked but didn &apos;t see .
( applause ) bruno giussani : thomas piketty . thank you .
i would love to see google maps inside some of these caves .
gracias .
we redid the side of the building and re-proportioned the windows so it sort of fit into the space .
and so reading and educating your emotions is one of the central activities of wisdom .
so what &apos;s actually happening is that social networks and real-time technologies are taking us back .
the women in this room and watching in l.a.
i thought , the love you have for your children is unlike any other feeling in the world , and until you have children , you don &apos;t know what it feels like .
at the same time , for me and for many other people , that view is a bit too close to simply denying the datum of consciousness to be satisfactory .
so , her caretakers took her to the village medicine man , and instead of suggesting to the caretakers that the girl be taken to a hospital , the person decided to burn her abdomen with red-hot iron bars to drive out the demons .
and unfortunately or fortunately , chemistry won .
fortunately , the big tech companies seem to agree .
and the idea is that the character has an inner motor , a dominant , unconscious goal that they &apos;re striving for , an itch that they can &apos;t scratch .
hey , hey black-eyed susie , hey .
it &apos;s a nonprofit , venture capital fund for the poor , a few oxymorons in one sentence .
so my team has taken five days-worth of growth , a typical growth cycle for us , and condensed it into a 15-second time lapse .
they were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves .
and my theme was this : our earth has existed for 45 million centuries , but this one is special — it &apos;s the first where one species , ours , has the planet &apos;s future in its hands .
so does all this matter ? or is globaloney just a harmless way of getting people to pay more attention to globalization-related issues ?
he &apos;s had that arm for about 20 months , so he &apos;s pretty good with it .
and you might say , &quot; &quot; can you really be that specific ?
and on the surface , cassini has found liquid .
what &apos;s it gonna look like ? we have huge grand challenges these days of habitat loss . we have more and more people , billions of people , in 100 years , god knows how many people , and how little space there will be to fit all of them , so we need to change the way that we see cities , and looking at this picture on the left of new york city today , you can see how gray and brown it is .
imagine a coil . for those of you that are engineers , there &apos;s a capacitor attached to it too .
i &apos;m pleased to say that there is now also a website looking at effective animal organizations .
what we saw is a lot of people — actually , at the beginning , we saw a lot more people opening the app because they were curious what they would find when they opened it .
several of these nutrients are essential chemical elements : phosphorus , nitrogen and calcium .
and i understand that .
let me show you what you could do right now .
this is great smoky mountains national park , and the hemlocks are dead as far as the eye can see .
so we prowl from house to house looking for flies captured in spider webs and we set them free .
so we go out for about five months every summer in a 20-meter catamaran , and we live , sleep and work at sea for weeks at a time .
and so this woman , mrs. young-soon han , i suppose will have taught me the most that i have learned about race .
for those of you who &apos;ve been there , fantastic coral reefs , fantastic diving , fantastic snorkeling .
and this is all over mathematics and this is all over computer science , and there &apos;s a really deep connection between empathy and these sciences .
and in the spring , when the sun returns to the ice , it forms the phytoplankton , grows under that ice , and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed , and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life .
and we quickly realized that our coming together was more than just a union of two people , but was a model of possibility for the millions of lgbtq folks who have been sold this lie that family and matrimony is antithetical to who they are — for those of us who rarely get to see ourselves reflected in love and happiness .
so i decided , i &apos;m going to make this a real biennial .
( applause ) and that number is really powerful , because last year we only graduated 7,500 women in computer science .
so given the prince loved his music , haydn thought he &apos;d write a symphony to make the point .
( applause ) so i just want to say a couple more things about that particular story , and then try to generalize how could we have stories of success all over the place for these diseases , as sam says , these 4,000 that are waiting for answers .
so what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an asian person and a european person by looking at their ingredients list .
basically , i was brought up to be a good samaritan , and i am .
since i joined twitter in 2011 , misogyny and misogynists have amply demonstrated they will dog my every step .
we &apos;re on the verge of a whole new social science .
what is a chubby , curly-haired guy from holland — why is he whistling ?
he sees something in the path .
she did things she always wanted to do .
i &apos;ve brought with me , from southern california , the fm device .
this is a very , very low level in order to be kicked out of the health care system .
and in a plastic-wrapped and packaged world , he doesn &apos;t hold out much hope for that , either .
and providing data free of charge on the internet , for the world to use . thank you very much .
rsw : no . what did he say ?
( laughter ) so , it was in the course of these investigations that i ran into a map .
this is happening today .
i mean , it was so incredibly close .
they were basically a city living with a modern kind of industrial metropolis with an elizabethan public infrastructure .
i went there looking for truth .
it takes 20 years to produce somebody with a ph.d.
my bosses , in the beginning , were very surprised .
well , then you look to europe , and the most important alliance in the world has been the transatlantic relationship .
and some of this , again , is in the realm of political work .
on a typical day , do you wake up with hope or gloom ?
and after we failed , i just kept failing .
it had to be shipped to london .
ca : okay . so , thank you , mark .
so our team released a very easy , simple-to-use tool in plain language to help people prepare , to help ease their nerves , to help them feel more confident in taking the next step in pursuing their american dream .
and the problem is , that turns you into a shrewd animal who treats life as a game , and you become a cold , calculating creature who slips into a sort of mediocrity where you realize there &apos;s a difference between your desired self and your actual self .
and we didn &apos;t find a single record of any preference about goals , treatments or outcomes from any of the sets of notes initiated by a doctor or by a patient .
so for instance , we are asking ourselves , how can we create more light ?
and the exciting thing is it &apos;s starting to grow .
( applause ) chris anderson : stop . i &apos;ve got two questions .
but we only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged brain compared to the brain of an alzheimer &apos;s patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease .
it &apos;s just the female .
i became so hysterical over her treatment , that eventually , she was just beaten behind closed doors .
we have a long history of strong , courageous , independent women , ever since the viking age .
there &apos;s not a lot of clickiness .
i achieved access to the data , and today i &apos;m able to do physics at the level of the best astronomer , using sound .
his friends and former students became his doctors .
i hope that you will be able to see not just my taliban-like beard , but also the richness and color of my perceptions , aspirations and dreams , as rich and colorful as the satchels that i sell .
i &apos;ll tell you very quickly how the effect works .
for almost a century , we didn &apos;t know much about these .
am i going to be asexual ? &quot; &quot; because from what i knew about fgm , the whole aim of it was to control the sexuality of women .
to be clear , i &apos;m not suggesting that we do away with countries .
and suddenly the most amazing things started coming out of our daughters &apos; mouths .
we &apos;re now on the couch , looking out through the window at cars passing by .
people low on it like things that are familiar , that are safe and dependable .
they are 75 percent of the energy consumption — up to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
as i said , all the balconies can move , but they can also be disappeared completely .
consider that blue icon for a ted talk that you &apos;re writing .
they &apos;ve probably got these environmental risk factors and / or genetic risk factors we don &apos;t know about .
there &apos;s no waste .
and even being here — i mean , the last few days , i &apos;ve known heights of obsessive behavior i never thought about .
( breathes in ) ( breathes out ) so , i didn &apos;t always make my living from music .
but i think today that most would agree that greece was only a symptom of much deeper structural problems in the eurozone , vulnerabilities in the wider global economic system , vulnerabilities of our democracies .
they will say the worst things about you .
and , sadly , we don &apos;t know .
( laughter ) so why do we think that our choice of a four dollar shade-grown fair trade artisanal cup of coffee in a reusable mug matters , but what we do with 4,000 dollars in our investment account for our ira doesn &apos;t ?
and humor is a good way , i think , to address serious issues .
when the soul lies down in that grass , the world is too full to talk about .
they have the people and the government with this exclusive dependency , but the problem here is that congress has evolved a different dependence , no longer a dependence upon the people alone , increasingly a dependence upon the funders .
( applause )
and after i left mattel , i started all these hamburger makers , and then got the license to make the maker .
this is one of the best-known phenomena in the quantum world , quantum tunneling .
that was fall of &apos; 95 . but then , by the time that winter was rolling around , he said , &quot; &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
many people said that night that it was the first time that they had a meaningful religious experience in their entire lives .
it gives us some information vegetables ; it gives us some information dessert .
we often dwell on human trafficking survivors &apos; victimization .
these were literally wild-posted all over new york one night , and there were definitely some heads turning , you know , people smoking and , &quot; &quot; huh ! &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and it was purposely done to look fairly serious .
conservation issues are normally guided towards rare , endemic plants , but what we call exotic plants , that is , the ones which grow in many different habitats across the world , they also need to be considered .
the second thing we believe is we believe in going with the grain of human nature .
when the industrial revolution started , the amount of carbon sitting underneath britain in the form of coal was as big as the amount of carbon sitting under saudi arabia in the form of oil .
it tries to balance out , and that &apos;s just .
and that would remind you that you would want to then introduce your friend ed cook .
3.8 billion years of field-testing .
there &apos;s something in new york city .
and it goes with a book that says , &quot; &quot; read my pins . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) pm : so is this a good idea .
that area of design interests me the most , and i think this for me is a real clear , very simplified version of what i &apos;m talking about .
as whole human beings , we will be better caregivers and breadwinners .
as one cmu prisoner said , &quot; we &apos;re not being tortured here , except psychologically . &quot;
so if you measure the precursor signal , you can actually identify pre- and post-maturity problems in advance .
and you know , and the troubling thing is that it &apos;s much easier to do something bad than to defend against all possible bad things , so the offensive uses really have an asymmetric advantage .
but this is not an ancient conflict .
ca : c &apos;mon , c &apos;mon . martial arts , games . c &apos;mon .
when you are told that carrots have human rights because they share half our genes — but not how gene percentages confer rights — wizard .
even the cowboys are pit crews now .
and meanwhile , at acting school ...
remember when images were first possible with a computer , those gorgeous , full-color images ?
now , what &apos;s important about what these people are doing is that they &apos;re beginning to learn how to communicate with species that are not us but share a common sensory environment .
it says , &quot; &quot; i will be a little late for school tomorrow . &quot; &quot; he was supposed to be in the school at 8 a.m.
so the idea that we can actually involve people in doing this thing together , collectively .
we &apos;ve got to wake up to the fact that we don &apos;t have any more and that this is a finite planet .
it &apos;s not special to us .
can we harness these same technologies for an emotionally sensitive output ?
( laughter ) and again , we think that &apos;s perfectly normal and natural , but that has not been the case for most of human history .
i must say there is magic in these moments .
my wife &apos;s loveliness almost consumes me .
if you drove past solly somewhere out on the reserve , you look up in your rearview mirror , you &apos;d see he &apos;d stopped the car 20 , 50 meters down the road just in case you need help with something .
i remember the searchlight that followed me when i made the night runs from my barrack to the latrine .
we need — we don &apos;t know where this thing is going .
as a matter of fact , ethologists know this .
so what do i have to do ?
it &apos;s being resolved at the level of items , or ideas , or words , if you want .
but in most of the rest of the world , that &apos;s not the case .
and third is that their image has nothing to do with africa and with ethiopia .
so one thing slammed up against another , such as in sao paulo here .
this is a remote operated vehicle beneath the ocean .
there &apos;d be virtually no learning curve .
he &apos;s speechless , but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best orators cannot .
and she said , you know , she &apos;s 90 . she &apos;s running out of time , she said .
you &apos;re probably thinking that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
really , it &apos;s just three things this whole age will be remembered for .
it took about three to four hours to run the simulation .
the last generation &apos;s problem was , we need more food and we need it cheap .
okay , you simply wouldn &apos;t .
ot : thank you .
( laughter ) and there is some truth to this , in the sense that we have something of a finite resource , and increased growth is going to push up demand for that .
sort of leadership by humiliation .
that would save hundreds of millions of dollars in legal costs in the united states and would decrease the cost of medicine for everyone .
because it turns out that the number one cancer in women , breast cancer , is regulated by estrogen and by this enzyme aromatase .
the little lego car in the beginning of the video references the big , real car near the end of the video .
we decided to give it a try , because we thought , &quot; &quot; hey , how hard could it be ? &quot; &quot; we have already an autonomous vehicle .
and this next postcard was made out of one of those photos .
so we bought 100,000 books and sent them to india .
and is it fair to say that it &apos;s simple ?
in other words , it is theoretically possible that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable of creating human beings that glow in the dark .
so , if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs , at some stage , the next step of the ladder has to follow .
and he beat me too . but that didn &apos;t change the fact that it was a nightmare for my family ; it was a nightmare .
hopefully it won &apos;t stutter .
so what you see here is a subtraction of areas in which there &apos;s more brain activity when you &apos;re playing people compared to playing the computer .
i estimated that , just today , across the world , we spent about 106 average world lifetimes teaching people how to calculate by hand .
we also have the mathematics to describe how neurons collect information , and how they create a little lightning bolt to communicate with each other .
where had he gone ?
they &apos;re made by the gazillions in china and india , and we can source them anywhere in the world , build the chair anywhere , and most importantly repair it , even out in a village with a local bicycle mechanic who has local tools , knowledge and parts available .
here &apos;s our hamburger cutaway .
when you make an investment , what you &apos;re really saying is , &quot; &quot; i accept that any one of these 100 things could happen to me and determine my wealth . &quot; &quot; now you can try to move your outcomes around .
you &apos;re live .
but there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it .
no , no , no , shush . we &apos;ve got to go quickly .
the low estimate is the nuclear energy industry estimate of nuclear .
a few years ago , a university student asked me , &quot; what is the greatest surprise in your life ? &quot;
in the worst cases , there are simply not enough jobs in the public health sector , where most poor people are treated , not enough political will , not enough resources , not enough anything — just too many patients with no care .
and then the child turned two , and i started using the cheap and easy treatment , and i wonder &quot; &quot; — and she wondered , like all parents who lose children wonder — &quot; &quot; if there isn &apos;t something that i could have done , like keep on using that complicated , expensive cure . &quot; &quot; and she told all the other people , and she said , &quot; &quot; how could it possibly be that something that &apos;s cheap and simple works as well as something that &apos;s complicated and expensive ? &quot; &quot; and the people thought , &quot; &quot; you know , you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s very important to learn that math is a great way to do that .
because i want to show the people what does data retention mean .
fourth , we only execute 20 milliseconds &apos; worth of that strategy .
space that exists within us , and without us .
and they face limitations , constraints , they may be weak , they may be located in the wrong part of the world , they may be einstein , stuck away farming someplace in a rural village in india not being noticed , as was the case for ramanujan for a long time , a great mathematician but nobody noticed .
i &apos;ve seen all sorts of animals fall in , and what &apos;s shocking to me , is the process is pretty much the same .
so , i want to show the trailer , and then i &apos;m going to take apart one scene in detail .
he and his team had been documenting the over 4,000 lynchings of african-americans that have happened in the american south .
and he is credited with doing over 4,000 of these public surgeries , wandering around in europe , which is an astonishing number , when you think that surgery must have been a last resort .
so the question is , how can you carry a pilot around the world with an airplane that uses the same amount of energy as a big christmas tree ?
you know , i &apos;ve realized that wolfram alpha actually gives one a whole new kind of computing that one can call knowledge-based computing , in which one &apos;s starting not just from raw computation , but from a vast amount of built-in knowledge .
my mum wanted to , couldn ’ t afford it .
they &apos;re flower-feeders , and as they move from flower to flower , basically on a shopping trip at the local floral mart , they end up providing this valuable pollination service .
that i am someone who has drunk , drank , drunk of the bitter dregs of near-disaster in childhood and emerged not just unscathed but strengthened .
forty percent of municipalities self-report dumping raw or partially treated sewage into our waterways .
( laughter ) so jake cress is this furniture maker , and he makes this unbelievable set of furniture .
we proved with those measurements that crocodiles scaled isometrically .
it &apos;s certainly something he can relate to .
and the fish also were happy to be there .
he made a lot of really interesting cultural references .
i danced through chemo and radiation cycles , much to the dismay of my oncologist .
and i think part of what i &apos;m learning in this process is that one must allow oneself to feel grief .
i want to leave you with another image of a japanese tea bowl . this one is at the freer gallery in washington , d.c.
and it turns out that they behave like quantum particles .
but you also need to have values .
for the first time in years , shi &apos;ites were allowed to make the pilgrimage to karbala to observe ashura , and i was amazed by the sheer number of people and how fervently they practiced their religion .
meanwhile , another little girl tried everything she could think of until she slid the red button , the cute doggie popped out , and she squealed with delight .
so he &apos;s got memory .
the mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra .
we &apos;ve heard a lot about the promise of technology , and the peril .
in the oil and mining sector , for example , there is now the beginning of a truly worldwide transparency standard that could tackle some of these problems .
merci . we have to prepare for the following performance , and i have a question for you , and the question is this : you show up in places like the ones you just have shown us , and you are carrying a camera and i assume that you are welcome but you are not always absolutely welcome .
the first such one is called &quot; &quot; the whale hunt . &quot; &quot; last may , i spent nine days living up in barrow , alaska , the northernmost settlement in the united states , with a family of inupiat eskimos , documenting their annual spring whale hunt .
a 21-year-old monk . he was very happy .
and of course , the name of the giant is goliath and the name of the shepherd boy is david , and the reason that story has obsessed me over the course of writing my book is that everything i thought i knew about that story turned out to be wrong .
this is a fairly new one that throws us off because of the conflicting patterns of comparing this angle with that angle .
what if — ( game ) nathan : here it comes . yay !
so here &apos;s a tumor .
the good news is you can manipulate them .
and six , the work ethic .
and i think that there is an easy cure for ndd .
these were evolved in very different times — we &apos;d like to actually change those programs .
we all know .
in the case of disgust , what is a little bit more surprising is the scope of this influence . it makes perfect sense , and it &apos;s a very good emotion for us to have , that disgust would make me change the way that i perceive the physical world whenever contamination is possible .
the real question : is this distorted worldview what we want for americans in our increasingly interconnected world ?
and this nonpartisanship is something that exists , that has existed in secret in america for years and years and years .
60,000 species are known to science , but more than 1.5 million have been estimated to exist .
what about if we use a big hammer and we swing it and we hit the nail like this , in the place of putting the hammer on the nail and pushing and try to put it in ? that won &apos;t work .
they &apos;ve studied the institutions that facilitate our trade , like legal systems , corporations , marketplaces .
it &apos;s true , we &apos;ve got a huge food problem , but this isn &apos;t science .
why didn &apos;t dad say art ? why wasn &apos;t it okay ?
which i found very interesting that it was going full cycle : i was making comments about the press and about how we know facts and information only by media — because we don &apos;t know the real people ; very few of us know the real people — but it was going back into the press and they were publicizing , effectively , my filthy work .
clicking on a train wreck just pours gasoline on it .
( laughter ) up until our mother asked him to leave and not come back , bageye had been a terrifying ogre .
and so i feel so blessed with everything that i have , that two days a week i go and i counsel hiv patients .
so one squared is one , two squared is four , three squared is nine , five squared is 25 , and so on .
talking about income inequality , even if you &apos;re not on the forbes 400 list , can make us feel uncomfortable .
and yes , we africans can .
maybe it was the optimism that i had about america that made me take a while to understand that things were not going to change .
now what does this all have to do with social problems ?
i want to tell you some stories that explain my view .
so a couple of observations stand out for me from this slide .
so we asked those guys to do it again .
things get more interesting .
not necessarily , no .
here &apos;s nylon going back to caprolactam back to carpet .
in a thankfully voluntary section of okcupid , you are allowed to rate how attractive you think people are on a scale between one and five .
in fact , i &apos;ll just go into one area — if you &apos;re looking at alzheimer &apos;s , for example , drug discovery — there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out because scientists in that field realize this is a great way of getting out of those silos , because they had their genomics data in one database in one building , and they had their protein data in another .
you know , from the hindsight of history , what &apos;s always most inexplicable and inexcusable are the simple failures of compassion .
now , this was a mystery in the new york times where the honey was very red , and the new york state forensics department came in and they actually did some science to match the red dye with that found in a maraschino cherry factory down the street . ( laughter ) so you can tailor your honey to taste however you want by planting bee-friendly flowers .
you have to act compassionately .
in 1998 , human embryonic stem cells were first identified , and just nine years later , a group of scientists in japan were able to take skin cells and reprogram them with very powerful viruses to create a kind of pluripotent stem cell called an induced pluripotent stem cell , or what we refer to as an ips cell .
and where health begins is not in the four walls of a doctor &apos;s office , but where we live and where we work , where we eat , sleep , learn and play , where we spend the majority of our lives .
hey , why not ?
so , three years ago i discovered , the letters m-i-t occurring in simplicity and complexity .
because if you can &apos;t get it in nashville , you can travel to birmingham , two hours away , and you &apos;ll get it . if you can &apos;t get it in cleveland , you can go to cincinnati . we don &apos;t have that luxury , so we have to make it happen .
three things stand out : leadership , diplomacy and institutional design .
and they would coalesce for just a moment , so you could perceive that there was a chair there .
we picked three houses in the center of the community and we start here . we made a few designs , and everybody liked this design of a boy flying a kite the best .
of foremost importance is a thorough , well-organized knowledge of all that is known of the relevant entities and processes that might be involved in that domain you propose to enter .
here &apos;s a key passage where he basically describes the staircase .
the food and agricultural organizations of the world have suggested that we need a 70 percent increase in current agricultural practice to meet that demand .
they were run by an inexperienced staff , with no visual culture , no budgets for visuals — in many places there were not even art directors .
&quot; &quot; one does not put sugar in green tea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i understand , &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; that the japanese do not put sugar in their green tea , but i &apos;d like to put some sugar in my green tea . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) surprised by my insistence , the waiter took up the issue with the manager .
powerful new technologies always present enigmas .
( applause )
five , the consumer society .
maybe have the same kind of security to play .
so here &apos;s the cool part .
computer-generated movies are really mainstream today , but it took ed and his colleagues nearly 20 years to create the first full-length c.g. movie .
that was actually caused by a school of parrot fish that had started eating it , though luckily , they lost interest before killing it .
and so then he looks at me .
and , in fact , it was a system where we would layer primarily communal spaces , stacked to more and more individual and private spaces .
this is carnegie hall .
and this is one aspect that truly fascinates me .
all these schools in texas compete with one another to achieve these milestones , and there are bonuses and various other treats that come if you beat the other schools .
we said things like , why can &apos;t people set their own salaries ?
and we go through a period of accelerating expansion , and the universe expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent , then to the dark ages , and then the first stars turn on , and they evolve into galaxies , and then later they get to the more expansive galaxies .
there is not only in china , but also in the united states there are some very small , cute but bad cats .
all three were diagnosed with lung cancer , the number one cancer killer of women in the united states today .
and suddenly , everything that you had planned or expected in your lives was irrevocably changed forever .
( applause ) friday : a universal truth — five words for you : gold sequins go with everything .
and you crank it several times .
but there &apos;s another important way that we learn about the world : that &apos;s by interacting with it .
music is medicine . music changes us .
i traveled with the arhuacos , and the wonderful thing about this story was that this man , danilo villafane — if we just jump back here for a second .
and she started it about 10 years ago , and today , she educates over a quarter million african girls .
he said , &quot; &quot; the business is on and i am trying to blah blah blah ... &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; dude , you have to use the code ! &quot; &quot; what followed is the greatest email i &apos;ve ever received .
bj : so you have to know , looking into the eyes of lions and leopards right now , it is all about critical awareness .
you can start to unpack the choices involved because of the side effects .
np : make some noise ! make some noise !
i believe we are the gold .
also we are choosing by looking at what others are choosing .
so by this way , the kid , to take care of himself , is to take care of this living object .
now because we haven &apos;t fully processed this information , it &apos;s kind of coming back to us in our pop culture in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways , where you can see that the stereotypes are changing .
i &apos;m instead just going to remind you of the point that bmi teaches us .
could you work on that problem ? &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s how gps was born .
you &apos;ve mastered fire .
so islamophobia isn &apos;t just the natural response to muslim terrorism as i would have expected .
i &apos;m an artist , so i &apos;d like to offer a modest proposal at the intersection of art , science and culture .
because it &apos;s hollow , it &apos;s lightweight , light enough to be lifted by just a few men , or , apparently , one woman .
after extensive research and testing of different materials like rubber , which i realized was too thick to be worn snugly on the bottom of the foot , i decided to print a film sensor with electrically conductive pressure-sensitive ink particles .
in the next 10 years , china will surpass the u.s.
sometimes you might put a band-aid in place to try and temporarily stop the pain .
here &apos;s how the song goes .
now , can someone own this idea ?
( laughter ) and as a result , i was sort of the deeply closeted kind of know-it-all for many years .
with a team of italian , venezuelan and brazilian speleologists , which is called la venta teraphosa , we will be back soon to latin america , because we want to explore other tepuis in the farthest areas of the amazon .

white men .
something never mentioned in the dozens of books about horses and their riders i devoured in those days .
but it doesn &apos;t .
he &apos;s actually a better dancer than i am , i have to say .
the roman physician galen thought that hysteria was caused by sexual deprivation in particularly passionate women .
but this team of multi-disciplinary , highly skeptical and exceedingly talented researchers do agree on two things .
giles was the first resident in the first house of the first charity that i set up to pioneer services for autism .
and i said , i &apos;ll measure them . they &apos;ll get a zero .
the arctic ice cap is , in a sense , the beating heart of the global climate system .
most of you said u , which is right .
it &apos;s a program through which the government could compel corporate america , it could deputize corporate america to do its dirty work for the nsa .
i can love my wife .
that &apos;s basically the difference .
because it was the temples that organized the harvest , gathered in the grain , offered it to the gods , and then offered the grain that the gods didn &apos;t eat back to the people .
we &apos;d had a great campaign , and to be honest , we &apos;d had our fair share of beer that night , but i said , &quot; &quot; you know what , i think we &apos;ve got one more bar left in us . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so we piled into a taxi , and this is our taxi driver , and i was sitting in the back seat , and he turned around and said , &quot; &quot; where are you going ? &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; hang on , that is an amazing mustache . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and he said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m doing it for movember . &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; so am i. &quot; and i said , &quot; tell me your movember story . &quot;
the temporary building is a triumph of modern industrial organization , a healthy sublimation of the urge to build , and proof that not every architectural idea need be set in stone .
so , to standardize this .
they help us resist disease , and they may even be affecting our behavior .
it has eight motors , four on the knees and four on the hip .
he has since passed away , but was mentally retarded and suffers from severe bone abnormalities .
changing behavior begins with evolving beliefs .
( laughter ) so at that point , think also about mars .
some anthropologists call that the original affluent society .
we steamed up the windows permanently , and every hour we had a different designer come in and write these things that they &apos;ve learned into the steam in the window .
i expected them to say to rob , &quot; hold on . we &apos;re coming . &quot;
they have electricity , but the question is , how many have washing machines ?
so i &apos;m going to show you an example now .
( laughter ) ca : to do all this , you must have been a genius from the get-go , right ?
( music ) i have some really strong memories from that week , and it &apos;s all about people .
and finally , there &apos;s deforestation , and there &apos;s emission of methane from agriculture .
we monitor pygmy rabbits with drones .
i mean , you lose .
i didn &apos;t do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and , well , we didn &apos;t have drugs in those days . but i did competition model airplanes .
instead of blowing a hurricane of chilled air through the stadium , we can use radiant cooling technologies , like a floor heating system where water pipes are embedded in the floor .
waiting for that recognition moment may be the best early indicator of the onset of dementia than anything that shows up clinically today .
but it isn &apos;t enough . i need to ask some more questions , and i hope they are questions that you will want to ask , as well , some of you .
( applause )
he goes to the federal polytech in zurich .
so , let &apos;s fire it up and see what it does .
what else do we know about the heart ?
now we can do anything , but more importantly , now we have a plan .
this is another poster from the school of visual arts .
so i went and met with his brother and father and said , &quot; &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
but when we got it , now you have all the level of activity , all the benefit from it . private sector has to do it .
that &apos;s good for it , despite what some restaurateurs may tell you .
secondly is about the anti-corruption movement in india .
dh : all right , we &apos;ll try again .
and this allows the bottle to turn into a game .
yes , they are very large in one dimension ; in the other dimension they are paper thin . very , very thin .
vishnu gave his judgment .
my teachers thought there was something wrong with me because i wasn &apos;t paying attention in class .
it takes a few minutes ; it &apos;s a sweet , simple parting image to usher in grief with warmth , rather than repugnance .
i call it &quot; &quot; sacré-coeur selfie . &quot; &quot; i watched over 15 hours all these people not even look at sacré-coeur .
i was awkward , insecure , and i hated it .
now typically , this doesn &apos;t lead to any overt illness .
at the bottom right is one that i built in my lab about 10 years ago , and we finally turned that into a product .
now this theory was of more than just intellectual interest to me .
so i will not really go too far into it .
it &apos;s the blockbuster comedy .
so we described these as cool boots .
back on highway 1 , i envisioned what awaited .
so what can we do about this ?
and the answer , obviously , is not .
i &apos;m really getting into this now .
every sound the child hears uncorrected is muffled .
we all know that exploration is risky .
so you may wonder , why on earth are they doing it ?
as educationists , we have never asked for technology ; we keep borrowing it .
i noticed that the house was occupied .
we &apos;ve been hearing them today and yesterday and every day for decades .
so as miraculous as this might seem , unfortunately , well , it &apos;s not that great .
( applause ) june cohen : thank you . so i think many people watching this will be asking themselves the question you just raised at the end : how can they do this in their own city ?
and i got to work on a new approach for breast cancer patients that could do a better job of telling the healthy cells from the unhealthy or cancer cells .
so the ngos become part of a public government system , rather than independent of it .
and my father said , &quot; &quot; why don &apos;t you just go to school ? &quot; &quot; and they sent me off to school , just to get busy somewhere there .
but , i personally found it wonderful .
every holiday i had as a young boy was in a national park .
bg : tell me in a few words about your new project , &quot; &quot; híbridos , &quot; &quot; here in brazil .
and one of the really surprising results in the last 20 years has been the discovery of other planets going around other stars .
this premieres in monaco — it &apos;s in september 2009 . if by any chance you can &apos;t make it , another idea with this project — here &apos;s this guy building his legacy through this very unusual form , through music and through the environment .
so that &apos;s definitely going to get through those 200 nanometer holes .
it &apos;s become an art form , a form of sculpture .
so the first lesson is : change and control the narrative .
i was standing , leaning against mahatma gandhi &apos;s statue .
you also know how much labor is needed .
their teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod .
now , take the same problem , chunk it into little modules , and motivations become trivial .
and then i was hearing and seeing and reading warnings from national muslim organizations saying things like , &quot; &quot; be alert , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be aware , &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in well-lit areas , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t congregate . &quot;
there you are , swinging the sun around .
there are resurrection themes in every society that has ever been studied , and it is because not just only do we fantasize about the possibility of resurrection and recovery , but it actually happens . and it happens a lot .
we have satellite maps where we can see where people are and where they &apos;re moving .
i &apos;m sure most of you know from school physics that it &apos;s basically splitting a white light into colors .
so how can we — ( applause ) how can we rebuild respect for truth and evidence into our liberal democracies ?
uninterrupted is the key .
he wrote a book called &quot; &quot; the four things that matter most &quot; &quot; about the four things you want to say to the most important people in your life before they or you die : thank you , i love you , forgive me , i forgive you .
and many of these chemicals are now linked to the skyrocketing incidents of chronic childhood disease that we &apos;re seeing across industrialized nations .
the people in the modern world , in the secular world , who are interested in matters of the spirit , in matters of the mind , in higher soul-like concerns , tend to be isolated individuals .
and what this project was doing was taking the effluent of these , and turning them into all of this food .
the website says , &quot; &quot; if you look , there &apos;s an individual mutation , and maybe a second , and maybe a third , and that is cancer . &quot; &quot; but , as a cancer doc , this is what i see .
we are now interdependent .
but those environments are going to be widely spaced in this universe .
you &apos;re kind of building a new type of distributed utility .
but now all of a sudden my job is very different , and my job is to be out here talking about it , talking about introversion .
and what we found was that 99 percent of the patients start to reverse the progression of their heart disease .
in a classroom with a reverberation time of 1.2 seconds , which is pretty common , this is what it sounds like .
it was very important , but mostly interesting because a kind of break , a separation between the mathematics coming from reality , on the one hand , and new mathematics coming from pure man &apos;s mind .
and he proved that you could actually teach people to do surgery using video conferencing .
and the central idea of this work is that the human mind and brain is not a single , general-purpose processor , but a collection of highly specialized components , each solving a different specific problem , and yet collectively making up who we are as human beings and thinkers .
he said that it was a project of peace and unity and that it brought people together .
and so , with funding from the bosack-kruger foundation , i got a lot of strains from these different countries and we measured their toxin production in the lab .
( laughter ) sw : at the zoo we have big cats from the jungle .
so that &apos;s not an accident that those things happen .
you can have no budgets , no people — but still can put your work to the highest possible level .
it &apos;s gotten smaller , it &apos;s got less detail , less resolve .
so they &apos;re quite beautiful , but they &apos;re beautiful because they &apos;re so smart and economical .
there was so much pain and loneliness , there &apos;s so much incredible things when you look in somebody else &apos;s eyes , because in the gaze with that total stranger , that you never even say one word — everything happened .
but i talked to her for a range of issues .
anyway , david greybeard — and i saw that he was picking little pieces of grass and using them to fish termites from their underground nest .
and for a small , poor country , one that is landlocked and mountainous , it is very difficult .
it was great , and it worked .
they &apos;re parodied , sometimes even demonized in the media for their kind of typical teenage behavior . they take risks , they &apos;re sometimes moody , they &apos;re very self-conscious .
you get that , and it &apos;s like a slap in the face .
but again and again , lived compassion brings us back to the wisdom of tenderness .
you will adapt to it and get used to it .
not that peculiar — there were only three women out of the 16 white house fellows .
this type of habitat covers more of the earth &apos;s surface than all other habitats combined .
( applause ) dg : well , no , it &apos;s a great point . it remains to be seen whether the joy of anticipation is exactly equaled by the amount of disappointment after the lottery . because remember , people who didn &apos;t buy tickets don &apos;t feel awful the next day either , even though they don &apos;t feel great during the drawing .
we started out at the cern cafeteria , which actually is great , because look , you have all the food and water you could ever want .
there &apos;s a new notation in the 19th century that expressed this , and if you use that notation , the equations get a lot simpler .
i &apos;ll let you in on the answer to the last one that i offer , and that is , it has nothing to do with human beings .
if we were to have to do it again the same way as with our first , we might stick with one kid . &quot; &quot; the birthrate needed in america to keep the population stable is 2.1 live births per woman .

the room went berserk — ( laughter ) — as frank nelson cole sat down , having delivered the only talk in the history of mathematics with no words .
and then finally , just as they &apos;re running out of time , someone takes out the marshmallow , and then they gingerly put it on top , and then they stand back , and — ta-da ! — they admire their work .

can you believe that ?
about one third of the entire world &apos;s population lived under that meta-narrative .
ca : thank you .
the next thing is that if you want to predict the effect of one species on another , if you focus only on that link , and then you black box the rest , it &apos;s actually less predictable than if you step back , consider the entire system — all the species , all the links — and from that place , hone in on the sphere of influence that matters most .
i am so cold .
take the armor off . be yourself .
so the same strategy that we used to find the code for the retina we can also use to find the code for other areas , for example , the auditory system and the motor system , so for treating deafness and for motor disorders .

you could do the same with a space spray .
tons of studies were done to see if this was true .
you know , this country is involved as we &apos;ve all heard , in this great healthcare debate .

but as you can also see , projected going forward , the gap widens a bit and raises a bit , and this graph is only through 2021 .
now if we manage to compromise these systems that control drive speeds and valves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
the second thing was apologizing .
and they come in and they go through the process , our process , they build confidence and now they think of themselves differently .

now , i mention squeak because sebastian &apos;s first guest happened to see a rather large mouse run across the kitchen , and she promised that she would refrain from leaving a bad review on one condition : he got a cat .
eighty thousand people spread over the entire valley .
and just as flowers spend a lot of effort trying to get pollinators to do their bidding , they &apos;ve also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them and give them to each other at times of birth and death , and particularly at marriage , which , when you think of it , is the moment that encapsulates the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another .
these things tend to happen every 25 years .
and even as he was walking out the door , he was still sort of pointing to his throat .
they hoped that this would contribute somehow to particle physics — didn &apos;t . it didn &apos;t , by itself , contribute to particle physics .
you have constant feedback . you have daily update sessions .
project excelsior , it was called .
it &apos;s curious that there is no evidence of mass die-offs of chickens or household birds across america before the human pandemic happened .
( laughter ) but basically i love being a woman .
no , i don &apos;t think a designer did come up with that .
dh : grab the blades in mid-air , land right there in a pool of blood ...

that not only helps europe diminish its reliance on russia for energy , but if you travel to north africa today , you &apos;ll hear more and more people saying that they don &apos;t really think of their region as the middle east .

by 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars even at the pace we &apos;re going at right now .
so i guess one question : this is a spectacular dream to reach out and empower a million women — how much of the current success depends on you , the force of this magnetic personality ?

or hollywood &apos;s siren call ?
now today , if you want to win the race , actually you need also something like this — something that monitors the car in real time , has a few thousand sensors collecting information from the car , transmitting this information into the system , and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected .

♫ but all the plastic ever made is still here . ♫ ♫ and no amount of closing our eyes ♫ ♫ will make it disappear . ♫ ♫ and the world can &apos;t take it ♫ ♫ very much longer . ♫ ♫ we &apos;re not going to make it ♫ ♫ unless we &apos;re smarter and stronger . ♫ ♫ the world &apos;s gonna shake itself free of our greed ♫ ♫ somehow . ♫ ♫ and the world can &apos;t take it , that you can see . ♫ ♫ if the oceans don &apos;t make it , neither will we . ♫ ♫ the world &apos;s gonna shake itself all the way free ♫ ♫ somehow . ♫
thank you .
and i believe that this is fundamentally a problem , because it doesn &apos;t really allow us to interact with our hands and capture the rich dexterity that we have in our bodies .
( laughter ) no , there &apos;s something else , something really fundamental , and it is : another reason why we don &apos;t have a good brain theory is because we have an intuitive , strongly held but incorrect assumption that has prevented us from seeing the answer .
what could it be ? &quot; &quot; so today , 100 years later , i invite you all on an incredible journey with me , a 37-year-old yale graduate and professor .
and what if we could value it a different way , so it would actually work ?
now , this is an interactive cartoon application .
my brief , as you &apos;ve just heard , is to tell you about statistics — and , to be more precise , to tell you some exciting things about statistics .
she was a state senator at the time , and we met here , at the airport , before a trip to china .
can you imagine what it would be like if amazon or ebay or google or microsoft or apple really went green and you caused that to happen ?
so we &apos;re talking about things like infill development : really sharp little changes to where we have buildings , where we &apos;re developing .
after all , the absence of a duty of care within many professions can all too easily amount to accusations of negligence , and that being the case , can we be really comfortable with the thought that we &apos;re in effect being negligent in respect of the health of our own societies and the values that necessarily underpin them ?
at the eighth stop , a girl came in with a giant duffel bag and announced she had pants for sale for a dollar — like you might sell batteries or candy on the train .
the second : keep mothers healthy , keep mothers alive , keep the children alive — no more orphans .
you see , history &apos;s rich in irony .
but i thought , perhaps the ant won &apos;t know , it &apos;ll probably move in .
someone they were kind to and cared for .
and while remixing and sharing have come to define the web as we know it , all of us can now be part of that story through simple tools that allow us to make things online .
( laughter ) the weather station &apos;s pretty interesting .
and in the same kind of trance that you can feel sometimes in the subway in new york when you &apos;re reading , there &apos;s something really soothing and easy .
for example , i saw pictures and images frequently of sadness and suffering .
i &apos;m playing around with perspectives and analogies .
all of this information is saved in a database that collects about 20,000 feelings a day .
frankly , i joined the army because college is really damn expensive , and they were going to help with that , and i joined the army because it was what i knew , and it was what i knew that i thought i could do well .
we &apos;ll have to .
creativity is essential to all of us , whether we &apos;re scientists or teachers , parents or entrepreneurs .
and interestingly enough , adam smith — the same guy who gave us this incredible invention of mass production , and division of labor — understood this .
scars that run from the middle of my chest all the way out to my outer torso .
so not the habitual architecture that instills in us the false sort of stability , but an architecture that is full of tension , an architecture that goes beyond itself to reach a human soul and a human heart , and that breaks out of the shackles of habits .
but what happened was that he had to be on medication that , at that time — diflucan , which in the states is used for yeast infections — cost 30 dollars a pill .
so that kind of motivational tool that is used actually , in and of itself , has a long-term side effect , in that every time we use a technology that uses something like public recognition or status , we &apos;re actually positively endorsing this as a good and normal thing to care about — that way , possibly having a detrimental effect on the long-term psychological well-being of ourselves as a culture .
in fact , what they did to get food was they got in their cars , drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts , came back with a week &apos;s worth of shopping , and wondered what on earth to do with it .
in the commercials , and on the boxes for the easy-bake ovens , hasbro marketed them specifically to girls .
but , this is not the beginning of the 20th century .
now why is that ?
what is wrong with the people that we have chosen ?
they &apos;re latin american .
in the 35 years i &apos;ve been a climbing guide and taught on indoor walls , and stuff like that , the most important thing i &apos;ve learned was , guys will always try to do pull-ups .
i may get many sponsors , a lot of money , tons of interviews , and be on tv ! &quot; &quot; i thought .
you know : thank god it &apos;s monday — i get to go back to that little cubicle , those fake gray walls , and hear everybody else &apos;s conversations f or 10 hours and then go home .
it ritualizes the impact of death on families and communities .
it &apos;s really unsatisfactory having plug-in art .
and he puts his cheese sandwich over here on top of the pirate chest .
i &apos;ve taken them camping in the kelp forests of california .
our democracies rely on elections .
it blocks the left on a whole range of issues that we on the left really care about .
saint obi : i was so fascinated , you know , with those cowboy movies .
and maybe , if we want to be on surer footing , what we really want is a moral framework that will help guide us there , that will tell us what kinds of things are right and wrong in the first place , and how would we know in a given situation what to do .
it wouldn &apos;t create the volume that would fill a large space such as the cologne opera house .
well , i was born with a rare visual condition called achromatopsia , which is total color blindness , so i &apos;ve never seen color , and i don &apos;t know what color looks like , because i come from a grayscale world .
so a few examples : we &apos;re now in the era of &quot; &quot; fantastic voyage , &quot; &quot; the ipill .
at the beginning of the project , i numbered all those buildings on my sketch , and there was no real interaction with the community .
is that your final answer ?
you have no way of controlling whether it &apos;ll be used by your side or the other side , by good guys , or by bad guys .
and , using those rules , he was able to say that there are in fact only two objects with six symmetries .
i &apos;m talking about today .
there are so many things to do in this life , and if we could have a simulacrum , a digital doppelgänger of ourselves that helps us process books , do shopping , be our best friends , i believe our mind clones , these digital versions of ourselves , will ultimately be our best friends , and for me personally and bina personally , we love each other like crazy .
but the market also had bypassed low income farmers , because these systems were both too expensive , and they were constructed for fields that were too large .
we conducted about a dozen focus groups with a broad cross-section of black men , and we learned that for them , being healthy was as much about being perceived as healthy as it was about feeling healthy , and that feeling good went hand in hand with looking good .
these are the couples that don &apos;t let anything go unnoticed and allow each other some room to complain .
so i will do this .
i think it &apos;s the wrong question to ask .
so you see , roy price is a senior executive with amazon studios .
you &apos;re in an accident . you &apos;ve got two choices : you &apos;re going to die , or you &apos;re going to take the hydrogen sulfide and , say , 75 percent of you is saved , mentally .
so when you do this sort of reconstruction , if you don &apos;t use some sort of guide image or guide statistics , then you &apos;ll get a sort of confusion of different points of view , because it &apos;s ambiguous .
well , if poor old suki is in search of a mate , what would suki do to find the perfect mate ?
np : standing right there in the corner , &quot; &quot; aw , dad — listen to that . &quot; &quot; ( beatboxing ) naw , i &apos;m kidding . but you know what ?
okay . ah , there is lots of nice bright video .
they brought in hundreds of volunteers , they put them into groups , and they gave them very hard problems to solve .
we have to deal with it .
or have they established their own sort of evolutionary niche that is independent of technology ?
this book i wrote because i want to figure out life .
and medical illustration is still art .
i sort of looked at myself standing there , going , &quot; &quot; oh , jimmy , this is complete loads of codswallop .
my hope is we can actually turn what might be a high-risk moon shot into something that &apos;s more reliable .
i was in india , and i was walking down the streets , and i saw a billboard painter .
it keeps it from being the u.n.
they have been forced off their lands .
or his restaurant , pod , in philadelphia , pennsylvania .
i think the end of the story of the whaleship essex offers an illuminating , if tragic , example .
we walked through these slums , identified houses where children would never go to school .
you can see if someone &apos;s a smoker , you can see what kind of music they like , you can see if they &apos;re going to bring their dog along for the ride .
please join them . turn off your air conditioning and turn on your fans . &quot; &quot; and wouldn &apos;t you know it , they did .
and i wore it whenever i could , thinking it was the most fabulous thing i owned .
kids do worse in the more unequal societies .
xk : do you have a perspective — i don &apos;t want to use &quot; &quot; angle &quot; &quot; because that has a negative connotation — but do you know how this is going to play out ? ( ms : no idea . ) david cohn : how much money does it take to do this ?
however , i will show to you now that we do not need to go to mars to explore alien worlds .
and so i got myself a job and i was working for a consultancy , and we would get in to these meetings , and these managers would come in , and they would say , &quot; well , what we &apos;re going to do here is really important , you know . &quot;
it &apos;s the reason we &apos;re not in the dark ages anymore .
but who is going to want to plug them in ?
but to get it , they would have to &#91; get &#93; it signed by one of the women .
and other people would draw stick figures or smiley faces .
in 1988 , a logging company convinced local residents that there would be absolutely no environmental impact from a new method they were trying called &quot; &quot; selective logging , &quot; &quot; taking out a tree here and there rather than clear-cutting a whole area .
women &apos;s ability to find the right word rapidly , basic articulation goes up in the middle of the menstrual cycle , when estrogen levels peak .
and somehow , tapirs are still there , which gives me a lot of hope .
so that nervous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , tremendously sped up the whole process of evolution .
five to seven percent only are inspected — five to seven percent .
what phenomenon — if it &apos;s not a desert , what phenomenon makes water gush from the ground into the atmosphere with such power that it can be seen from space ?
she rocketed to the top of her class .
( applause )
in the science of today , we become artists .
we cannot only have grateful experiences .
look at this cartoon by roz chast , the guy reading the obituary .
this is our roof in new york , the roof of the studio .
we also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of 13 related organisms , and we tried to compare all of those , to see what they had in common .
they are shaping the way we consume .
( music : &quot; &quot; rapper &apos;s delight &quot; &quot; by the sugarhill gang ) the mc would improvise lyrics in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies .
but of course , that &apos;s a little bit like kissing your sister as far as driving a car , so the kids want to do a steering wheel ; so they draw a steering wheel .
( applause ) chris asked me to add — the theater is under construction , and this project will start construction in about a year , and finish in 2010 .
( tapping ) so my artistic practice is all about listening to the weird and wonderful noises emitted by the magnificent celestial objects that make up our universe .
a total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear .
the center of life is water .
through constant experimentation with materials , they developed a wide range of iconic solutions that we know today , eventually resulting in , of course , the legendary lounge chair .
and to boot , there was no name for this problem .
for all the scare stories , the actual actions of investors spoke of rapid acceptance and confidence .
and then accounting for things like my shaky voice , and i knew i would be singing about a half-octave higher than normal , because i was nervous .
as a young magician , i was obsessed with houdini and his underwater challenges .
i got tons and tons of generosity from everyone involved .
some of you have seen the flag .
he was looking for a heart attack , that &apos;s what i say .
we &apos;re not doing that well when it comes to insurance .
walk the talk .
so here are some of the works i would like to show you .
but i intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible .
in fact , this effect is so strong that when someone gets a college degree , the spillover effects of this on the wages of others in the metropolitan area are actually greater than the direct effects .
it &apos;s a pretty simplistic approach to root cause analyses .
we &apos;ve had the internet in its public form for almost 20 years now , and it &apos;s still changing as the media becomes more social .
and also for the men alongside whom they served .
thank you .
and so , here you go .
so , thank you . ( applause ) well , i tell you that story because it wasn &apos;t unique to britain .
in the next month , the end of december , you &apos;ll see ovarian cancer , and then lung cancer will come several months after .
it cannot be because of some broadcast mechanism affecting everyone uniformly .
politics has come to resemble a cynical team game played by politicians , while the public has been pushed aside as if sitting on the seats of a stadium in which passion for politics is gradually making room for blindness and desperation .
and as these technologies go forward , you keep seeing this , you keep seeing this , you keep seeing things — 2000 , human genome sequence — and it seems like nothing &apos;s happening , until it does .
we want to avoid death , and the dream of doing that in this body in this world forever is the first and simplest kind of immortality story , and it might at first sound implausible , but actually , almost every culture in human history has had some myth or legend of an elixir of life or a fountain of youth or something that promises to keep us going forever .
and so i think we &apos;re ready to tackle one of the most important questions in neuroscience : how are the brains of men and women different ?
no relationship — gay , straight or anything — that we would regard as remotely healthy or functional looks like that , and yet somehow , you put it on prime time , you slap some makeup on it , throw the glitter on , put it out there as movement , not as text , and we , as a culture , tune in and clap .
and you can see in these central images here , scanning electron micrographs of some of these guys — these are gardens of these bacteria .
a few years before he died , after he had resumed writing poetry , but in secret , he confessed to a friend in a letter that i found when i was doing my research : &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve written a verse .
&quot; yahweh is our savior &quot; means &quot; he has saved the nation of israel , &quot; which at the time , was a pretty high-level social organization .
of course , the criminal justice system treats them as common old garden criminals .
now , it turns out , though , that there are several problems with this model .
the moment you admit to loving someone , you admit to having a lot to lose , and it &apos;s true that these questions do provide a mechanism for getting to know someone quickly , which is also a mechanism for being known , and i think this is the thing that most of us really want from love : to be known , to be seen , to be understood .
he wanted to continue to higher education , but due to his family living on the poverty line , he was soon sent to south africa to work and send back money to feed his family .
they &apos;re not just simple , dumbed-down things that we see in school math .
this is a german orchestra , yes ?
but once you also have people living in close proximity to each other , one of the things you can do is — as information technologies develop — you can start to have smart places .
with my new venture , marilyn monrobot , i would like to use art to create tech .
he &apos;s coached five olympians , and the man &apos;s office is lined from floor to ceiling with all america certificates of all these athletes he &apos;s coached .
audience member 2 : the king .
here &apos;s an example of this similarity .
turns out , ucla has an entire history of pain collection in their archives .
these are stem cells that we create from specific sources , and we can drive them to become heart cells , and they start beating in culture .
maybe you had a direct line .
i was fired five minutes after that .
in every aspect of their lives , they wished for progress , just as we do .
now we get to fight about all sorts of other issues .
now , it &apos;s quite possible that a future martin luther king or a mandela or a gandhi will have an iphone and be protected from government surveillance .
we called legal seafood — ( laughter ) we ordered a bunch of shrimp shells , we grinded them and we produced chitosan paste .
they would make a little bit more money ; their standard of living would shift and would get better .
that &apos;s a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do math , i &apos;m sure .
now the problem with the robots doing this is that they can &apos;t get unstuck , with the material .
these are zebra fish . they &apos;re normally black and silver .
so basically , china is a sick bric country .
( applause ) thank you .
when i was in the third grade , a monumental event happened .
so if we want to utilize self-assembly in our physical environment , i think there &apos;s four key factors .
the nepali women who were trafficked into the sex trade — they came together , and they decided that they were going to make the world &apos;s first anti-trafficking organization actually headed and run by trafficking survivors themselves .
this one , i would say , was a serious challenge .
and now i really like sort of sitting up , you know .
there are many promised lands , depending on your station in society , depending on your stage of life .
let &apos;s talk for a moment about what a model for processing visual information would need to do .
maps matter .
thank you all so much .
copying with variation and selection .
look at a hand . look at a remote control . chair . book .
why should we get away from those arguments ?
let &apos;s not forget these men , who are truly dying to work .
jabbar : then what about the rest of us ?
what experiments would you run ?
what i &apos;m going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas .
now , these people will make guesses , they &apos;ll say things like , &quot; &quot; why am i getting electricity ?
and their response , of course , was no more than we wanted to stop the genocide and put our troops in harm &apos;s way to do that , nor do we now want to get in the way and pluck genocidaires from camps .
b and v , as we said before , were never differentiated in the spanish language — ( applause ) let &apos;s choose one ; it could be either . we can discuss it , talk it over .
if we want humanity to last forever , we have to colonize the milky way .
it &apos;s thoroughly modern biggie .
and ultimately , we have to try that .
when these particles get to the road , they sense some kind of obstacle , and they bounce against it .
and michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt .
i bought some super sculpeys , some armature wire , some various materials .
it provoked tears as well as incisive questions about unarmed peace-keeping forces and the double-dealing of a western society that picks its moral fights with commodities in mind .
and if our fates are intertwined , then we believe that it is good karma , it is good fortune .
and here were are . we have a continuum in the world .
this is the basis for the device that these two guys at ford built .
what is completely lacking is a class of people who have immense amounts of power , but no money at all .
i do a lot of work for the school of visual arts , where i teach , and the director of this school — a remarkable man named silas rhodes — often gives you a piece of text and he says , &quot; &quot; do something with this . &quot; &quot; and so he did .
well , we asked thousands of people .
but we &apos;re coming to appreciate , is the transition from 2d to 3d , from programming bits to programming atoms , turns the ends of moore &apos;s law scaling from the ultimate bug to the ultimate feature .
what do you want in terms of medical intervention ?
thank you .
the only thing singing today would be the facts , for i have truly embraced by inner nerd .
my first semester in spanish , i got a d.
and we shall see what will happen with these countries .
i &apos;ve been part of a social movement that has been working on ending violence against women and children .
don &apos;t feel ashamed .
this is certainly not a cure for spinal cord injury , but i begin to believe that this may lead to an intervention to improve recovery and people &apos;s quality of life .
i wouldn &apos;t be able to talk about this here unless i had done it a few times .
now imagine that women are represented here , and men are represented here .
those of you who are from boston know that this was the moment — rare — where the red sox won the world series .
another thing is the answer was there all along , but we kind of ignored it because of this obvious thing .
so in my group , what we try to do is reverse engineer how humans control movement .
but not everyone can afford an iphone .
what i &apos;m pitching you today is actually not a stand-alone product .
it didn &apos;t come down by a verdict of somebody else .
it &apos;s a huge network under the surface of the tepui plateau , and in only ten days of expedition , we explored more than 20 kilometers of cave passages .
the first of these is natural selection — that &apos;s random mutation and selective retention — along with our basic anatomy and physiology — the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails .
and why can they serve that much ?
i do so many things on this little device .
&quot; &quot; the hour from night to day .
why do we respond so much to our knowledge of where something comes from ?
now this noise is so great that society places a huge premium on those of us who can reduce the consequences of noise .
they &apos;re changing the scale of what we can do , and what we &apos;ve developed is something we call fftt , which is a creative commons solution to building a very flexible system of building with these large panels where we tilt up six stories at a time if we want to .
first one is the political system .
as i said to you , this is the first time i &apos;ve shown this in public .
we depend on the fact that audiences , such as yourselves , will make assumptions .
i &apos;m a performer .
whether you &apos;re in the hierarchy or the heterarchy , it &apos;s a wonderful design challenge .
the challenge is we don &apos;t know the shape of the extra dimensions .
on your left side , you have &quot; &quot; operation smile . &quot; &quot; it is a computer-generated map of a social network .
these include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight .
dh : true . barry ...
but it &apos;s not just about policing government .
and the key is to promote a positive african attitude towards africa .
and this is a technically creative challenge , and it would change the perspective of people who worked on it .
judge forer quits , and ms. dewey in completely disheartened .
she was earning 450 dollars . she was doing okay .
william gregory was convicted of rape and burglary .
and the organization draws together people of different generations , like holly morgan , who &apos;s an undergraduate , who &apos;s pledged to give 10 percent of the little amount that she has , and on the right , ada wan , who has worked directly for the poor , but has now gone to yale to do an mba to have more to give .
but if i had to get a match to match , obviously , i would need a different design of a cellphone .
i &apos;ve actually got a website that &apos;s got a bunch of photos that i &apos;ve done of some of the other folks i didn &apos;t get a chance to show you .
the root mechanism of a dragon-king is a slow maturation towards instability , which is the bubble , and the climax of the bubble is often the crash .
stars will orbit the black hole in the very same way that planets orbit the sun .
it &apos;s way more energetic .
and in all these 42 cases , when we kept pushing them back , there was three kinds of reaction .
and the colors here represent the motivation behind the money .
here &apos;s a classic example : rebecca has a benign blood vessel tumor that &apos;s growing out through her skull , has obliterated her nose , and she &apos;s having difficulty seeing .
how might we improve access to safe drinking water for the world &apos;s poorest people , and at the same time stimulate innovation amongst local water providers ?
and just imagine the sense of wonder in a baby when it first discovers that , merely by uttering a sound , it can get objects to move across a room as if by magic , and maybe even into its mouth .
( applause )
we argue strongly that the people living in the house are simply not the problem .
i suppose it &apos;s there to tell you that somebody &apos;s cleaned the place , and it &apos;s all lovely .
i spoke up a little more at work .
&quot; &quot; this headscarf and these clothes , &quot; &quot; she says , &quot; &quot; give me the freedom to do what i need to do to speak to those whose support and assistance are critical for this work .
and then i thought , &quot; &quot; nah , that wouldn &apos;t be very nice . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) that attitude of only taking what you need was really what everybody had on the network in those days , and in fact , it wasn &apos;t just the people on the network , but it was actually kind of built into the protocols of the internet itself .
so , as we have faced liability , we have stepped back and back , and unfortunately , where there is liability , guess what there is : power .
they had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention .
and so what had happened , really , is that we found ourselves in a perceptual shift .
so we &apos;ve been working with transport for london , and that organization hasn &apos;t actually been responsible as a client for a new bus for 50 years .
i &apos;m going to ask and try to answer , in some ways , kind of an uncomfortable question .
child : um , yeah .
or this poor man who kept his diploma — he went to university of michigan , but he never would talk about his poverty as a youngster , ever — just would not mention it .
an average african country receives foreign aid to the tune of 13 , 15 percent of its gdp , and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources from rich countries to poor countries .
it was bad .
i have a friend in portugal whose grandfather built a vehicle out of a bicycle and a washing machine so he could transport his family .
modern technology is not going to change who we choose to love .
and then when it &apos;s time to go , a green light goes and the jumpmaster goes , &quot; &quot; go . &quot; &quot; the first guy goes , and you &apos;re just in line , and you just kind of lumber to the door .
and that &apos;s a really fascinating thing about this approach .
( applause ) i don &apos;t know if we have any statisticians in the house , but there &apos;s definitely something going on . ( laughter )
it &apos;s mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals .
we &apos;re about to do six in the u.k. next week .
you &apos;ve got the pictures you &apos;ve taken .
the wearable meeting .
they are believed to have magical powers .
maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery .
who knew about extension managers ?
we showed this to the hotel people the other day , and they were terrified and said that nobody would come to the ritz-carlton anymore , because of this fish .
when the shopping center died , the city restored the site &apos;s original wetlands , creating lakefront property , which then attracted private investment , the first private investment to this very low-income neighborhood in over 40 years .
that means we get our new hips for free .
so everyone who came into contact with ella or a family like ella &apos;s would spend 80 percent of their time working with the families and only 20 percent servicing the system .
yeah .
( applause ) chris anderson : quick question .
they are growing in political clout , as the mullahs are isolating themselves — with the exception of one group of mullahs , who are not well known to americans .
and if you do lavish as much technique as possible , and you try to make the highest quality hamburger , it gets to be a little bit involved .
he &apos;s an amnesic who had , very possibly , the worst memory in the world .
inside the rolls-royce is the queen mother .
so i want to talk about that as an opportunity that we really have failed to engage with very well in this country and , in fact , worldwide .
what &apos;s the regulation of the reserve and what is the regulation of the parks ?
right now that &apos;s all cleared out — this was done about eight months ago — and high-rises are now going up into that central spot .
a billion people , 1 / 6th of the world population .
that &apos;s like comparing the population of the world to the population of los angeles , proportionally speaking .
i &apos;m a sophomore and studying communications , tv and mass media , and basically trying to live life like a normal kid , which i always wanted growing up .
it was a concert he recorded in the shrine auditorium in 1949 .
it was a really wonderful experience , but when i got home , i suddenly felt very disconnected and suddenly shut in and shut out , and i was really surprised by those feelings .
it says a lot about her .
they digest our food , they make our vitamins , they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out .
so it &apos;s important to remember that whether it &apos;s good or it &apos;s bad , &quot; this too shall pass . &quot;
when i was a boy , in front of every house in the summer evenings , you would find young people together singing the songs of the day , or the old songs .
and their love &#91; for studying &#93; was so big that i cried .
you &apos;re just kind of moving around .
technology is just generally being used to allow us to create in as shared and social a way as possible .
you can look at the statistics , the frequency of the occurrence of peak-to-valleys of different sizes , which is represented in this graph .
the basic idea is they aggregate to form large groups , or swarms .
so i asked myself : okay , is this a model for creation , this adaptation that we do ?
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll be content together . &quot; &quot; he never used my nickname again .
now it &apos;s just five times , and soon it will be 2.5 times .
so that keeps me coming back .
and the more time you spend looking at this , the more things you also will see in the clouds .
we are talking about the cradle of democracy .
it &apos;s a composite view that &apos;s constantly changing and being updated .
there &apos;s quite a lot of people that are eating insects .
director 2 : can you not shut up ?
in germany , we are pushing the ratification of the un convention , which is a subsequent convention .
and we have the greatest chance of success if we recognize our vulnerability .
so who are these scientists and engineers at a magical place called darpa ?
let &apos;s see what happens here .
a little background : when my grade five was learning about child rights , they were made to roll incense sticks , agarbattis , for eight hours to experience what it means to be a child laborer .
we can make food more important , not less , and save ourselves by doing so .
it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; are you smarter than a fifth grader ? &quot; &quot; i think we &apos;ve learned the answer to that here .
thank you .
so the hindenburg wasn &apos;t , you know , it was inevitable it was going to go .
and this is a particularly small scooter for a gentleman of this size .
and brian allen was able , in a miraculous flight , to get the gossamer albatross across the english channel , and we won the 100,000-pound , 200,000-dollar prize for that .
any parents out there of teenagers ? all we do is cook for these people — they eat two , three , four dinners a night — it &apos;s ridiculous !
and then he said , &quot; &quot; what you do for the least of these , you do for me . &quot; &quot; now i was pretty psyched .
so the key thing in terms of these new tools that are kind of plumbing the depths of the global brain , that are sending kind of trace dyes through that whole bloodstream — the question is , are you finding out something new ?
and so you wouldn &apos;t sit that close to another person because of your notion that it &apos;s you versus the universe — that &apos;s all buddha discovered .
this turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans .
that first three years , ok , that was just what we couldn &apos;t solve for .
of course , when you digitize , that &apos;s not enough , because these documents , most of them are in latin , in tuscan , in venetian dialect , so you need to transcribe them , to translate them in some cases , to index them , and this is obviously not easy .
and the problem of poor vision , is actually not just a health problem , it &apos;s also an educational problem , and it &apos;s an economic problem , and it &apos;s a quality of life problem .
child : oh my god ! how did you do that ?
that &apos;s not the southwest season .
the majority of the planet , aspiring for development , having the right for development , are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle , a momentous pressure .
giraffes are this desire in the dark . &quot; &quot; this is important .
we &apos;ll start off easy .
our boat was floating like a matchbox on the water without any control .
and the fact that the polar bear and husky or magpie and a bear or you and i and our dogs can crossover and have that experience sets play aside as something separate .
and what you can really think of xml in this case is it &apos;s the packaging that we &apos;re putting around these pages .
as we saw with the teacher in cody , wyoming , she seems to be affected by the law .
so , for example , when you touch a pencil , microbial exchange happens .
you know , i &apos;m a middle class white man . i have no race , no class , no gender .
and now , for the first time , i can do something fun .
for example , i recently wrote an article in the new yorker magazine , but i can &apos;t afford to buy an ad in it .
and what this quantification showed us is that , upon experiencing a train of these air puffs , the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyperactivity which is persistent , long-lasting , and also appears to be graded .
now that argument , i made that argument 30 — oh my god , i don &apos;t want to think about it — more than 30 years ago , but there &apos;s a deeper argument implicit in what i &apos;ve told you , and i want to tell you that argument briefly , and that is , consciousness creates an observer-independent reality .
but there &apos;s a cost to this elegant unification , because years of research have shown that the math of string theory doesn &apos;t quite work .
but the problem is , there &apos;s only so much you can take , and also when you do that operation , your patients might actually have significant pain in that defect site even two years after the operation .
and people who live in cities in the developed world tend to be very prosperous , and thus use a lot of stuff .
and the short answer is games .
a recent report by the pew center on trends in america indicates that only 10 percent of young adults under the age of 30 &quot; place a lot of trust in the media . &quot;
it helped us exaggerate what we were afraid of , and we seek causality where there is none , and we then get an illusion of confidence where we believe that we are the best car drivers , above the average .
( applause )
but there are still over 650 million indians , pakistanis , sri lankans , bangladeshis , nepalese , who remain washed up on the shores of poverty .
nothing to worry about , right ?
and i wouldn &apos;t say that is the wrong thing in all circumstances .
she could have called her my friend , or my &quot; &quot; friend , &quot; &quot; or my &quot; &quot; special friend &quot; &quot; — ( laughter ) — or even worse , just not asked at all .
or should they be given an alternative standard of care , such as the best current treatment available in the country in which the research is being conducted ?
what was also clear was that people really wanted to know a lot more about how the technology would look and feel , and that there was really much more interest in this than we had ever thought possible .
so we take this just completely for granted .
of course , it &apos;s not all about food ; it &apos;s also about kids getting exercise .
i &apos;m a copy editor .
so here &apos;s an object , and in this case , it &apos;s a wire figure in the shape of a human , and we &apos;re going to film that object with just a regular camera .
so , i always tell my students , &quot; work smart , then work hard . &quot;
in fact , she indicated that if we would do that , not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude from the members of the extended family , but she said , &quot; &quot; even god will smile , and when god smiles , there is peace , and justice , and joy . &quot; &quot; so , at the table at 915 , i learned something about compassion .
okay .
and so our project is seeking to look at this readout , understanding which of these 25,000 genes is turned on .
sweet — energy .
crucially , asperger viewed autism as a diverse continuum that spans an astonishing range of giftedness and disability .
so when we want to learn whether a planet is habitable , whether it might be amenable to life , we want to know not only how much total light it receives and how warm it is , but we want to know about its space weather — this high-energy radiation , the uv and the x-rays that are created by its star and that bathe it in this bath of high-energy radiation .
it &apos;s one of those things , we got by just fine before we had to do any of those .
then you look at the phenomenon of kogi .
on one hand , on the left bank of the river , are the people like me who study those planets and try to define the environments .
and then we &apos;ll put on a satellite tag that will give us the long-distance journeys with the light-based geolocation algorithms solved on the computer that &apos;s on the fish .
very much in the same way , it &apos;s very difficult to see astronomical sources , because of the atmosphere that &apos;s continuously moving by .
i mean , if i got to go to tedx usc my life wouldn &apos;t suck . but i don &apos;t . so it does . &quot; &quot; if that &apos;s how you talked , imagine what kind of work would get done .
however , what i have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music .
on the left side , you see the yield produced using conventional agriculture , with a 100 percent phosphorus dose .
further to the right is more .
and because of that , then a lot of singers started saying , &quot; all right , what &apos;s virtual choir 2.0 ? &quot;
and they were interested in developing a new , alternative art space , and they needed funding for it , so they decided to come up with some interesting fundraising projects .
musician and natural soundscape expert bernie krause describes how a healthy environment has animals and insects taking up low , medium and high-frequency bands , in exactly the same way as a symphony does .
of course , you can &apos;t copy and paste education systems wholesale , but these comparisons have identified a range of factors that high-performing systems share .
girls were prohibited from going to school .
now to the funds we raise , and research , and how we &apos;re redefining research .
and i &apos;ve got to tell you , what i found out in the world in four different continents , was depressingly familiar .
the u.s. is actually becoming a bit of a leader in kind of enlightened urban planning and renewal , and i want to single out a place like chicago , where i look at some guy like mayor daley as a bit of a design hero for being able to work through the political processes and all that to improve an area .
( applause )
this leads me to the second thing that you would learn in your 30-minute exploration of drug violence in mexico .
it kind of makes you wonder about our own time .
everything started breaking .
whereas the film yesterday that we saw of the simulation of the inside of a cell , as a former molecular biologist , i didn &apos;t like that at all .
and that &apos;s what we do to all traffic survivors .
dare i admit that after she did it i never really loved her again ?
and in the context of particular courses , you can ask questions like , what are some of the misconceptions that are more common and how do we help students fix them ?
french parents were more likely to say things like , &quot; &quot; noah was here for so little time , but he taught us so much .
it &apos;s actually not very hard . ninety-eight percent of cases , this is a piece of cake .
when something changes , what happens to those properties ?
the present always contains the past .
but actually these , like i said , are still the actual prototype .
compared to your regular friends , they are boring and dull , right ? because in this new context , the comparison is very , very different . in fact , you find yourself disliking them enough almost to qualify for french citizenship .
so a kid who &apos;s 14 in high school gets this version of the pythagorean theorem , which is a truly subtle and interesting proof , but in fact it &apos;s not a good way to start learning about mathematics .
a few years ago , the number of babies dying in their first year of life in the world fell by five percent in just one year .
but i quite love the way it &apos;s posed .
and we did actually start calling ourselves martians .
that &apos;s how wally got hired .
and that chain link is really expensive .
but abed did not slow , and on that xeroxed piece of paper , my neck again broke , and again , i was left without anger .
&#91; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &#93; orange , good . &#91; &quot; &quot; table &quot; &quot; &#93; green .
many scientists can now grow many different types of cells .
and the women are diligent . they are focused ; they work hard .
which group loses the most weight , we give them prizes .
and , as you can see , the death rate goes down from 65,000 deaths per conflict per year in the 1950s to less than 2,000 deaths per conflict per year in this decade , as horrific as it is .
we tended gardens , we became interested in organic food , we knew or we were vegetarians .
( laughter ) my father taught me how to walk when i was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking .
it has no consciousness .
and we take the nerve away from your chest muscle and let these nerves grow into it .
so he taught me that physics is cool because it teaches us so much about the world around us .
and then , again , the building itself , middle of los angeles , right across from city hall .
it &apos;s as big as any of the biggest trees east of the mississippi river , and yet it &apos;s only a minor feature on chronos .
and there &apos;s the sheep .
this is not some game of thrones empire-level set of questions .
to our knowledge they had no music .
as you know , we are very interested in humanoid robot , human walking , so we decided to build a small humanoid robot .
build it from scratch proposed that it was time for a whole new system .
and these preservatives had been found in breast cancer tumors .
the purpose of these images is to inspire you , to motivate you , so that we can look at them and think , &quot; &quot; well , however bad my life is , it could be worse .
one of the things that happened right around world war ii in that same time period before , and as sure as hell afterwards , government got — realized that scientists aren &apos;t strange dudes that , you know , hide in ivory towers and do ridiculous things with test tube .
what about athens ? mediterranean climate , but in the sun it was not comfortable . they didn &apos;t perceive comfort .
thank you so much .
they &apos;re healthy ; they &apos;re clean — it &apos;s amazing .
china burns half the world &apos;s coal each year , and that &apos;s why , it is a key reason why , it is the world &apos;s largest emitter of greenhouse gases .
i think a lot of families are fractured by unrealistic expectations that are based upon this false vision of human sexuality .
it was like the waiting room in the doctor &apos;s office .
very recently , with collaborators , we studied a dynamical system where you see the dragon-king as these big loops and we were able to apply tiny perturbations at the right times that removed , when control is on , these dragons .
and over the last two years , 2,000 people has been crippled in the southern tip of bandundu region .
so i classify the people into three : uneducated , little educated , surplus educated .
but at the same time it was also impossible not to see the human vitality , the aspiration and the ambition of the people who live there : women washing their babies , washing their clothes , hanging them out to dry .
i study ants , and that &apos;s because i like to think about how organizations work .
rw : do you want me to hold you or not ? dh : don &apos;t hold me that hard .
just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property — no flower was damaged in the process of this shot ; it was just attached to the tripod , not killed — then under ultraviolet light , look at that .
some will be down to two or three .
not very well , it turns out . i can &apos;t do that .
and so if you ask this question : where would you look to see the future of education ?
and i want to take a moment to honor these house republicans — ( applause ) who had the courage last fall to step out and take a political risk , by telling the truth about the climate crisis .
by the time i left , we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars . and as we speak now , we have about 40 billion dollars in reserves due to proper management of our finances .
it can get sideways like a rally car driver , always able to take the tightest curve , even on slippery , changing surfaces , never spinning out .
it was vital in the transition , but what fascinated me was , in the transition to what ? what could actually work ?
very , very simple .
we will know that we &apos;re not that miracle , right , that we &apos;re just another duck in a row , we &apos;re not the only kids on the block , and i think that that &apos;s philosophically a very profound thing to learn .
if we do that , we not only get the jobs , we get the improvements in public infrastructure , the restoration of public infrastructure .
but seriously , would anyone like to choose a piece ?
so that leaves a couple of places like iran , maybe venezuela , that you would like to have very close surveillance of anything that goes on with fissile stuff .
( applause ) and in the first year , i had to fire half of the men .
so part of our understanding of this was given to us by ludwig boltzmann , an austrian physicist in the 19th century .
his bedside became a site for those seeking advice and spiritual counsel , and through us , my father was able to speak and uplift , letter by letter , blink by blink .
and i look at , on your show , actually , i kind of lost my voice , and i haven &apos;t gotten it back .
he &apos;s obviously not joanne — so we &apos;ll &quot; &quot; add user . &quot; &quot; evan . okay .
so let &apos;s make a change .
so , there &apos;s all kinds of bacteria on the earth that have no business being in you or on you at any time , and if they are , they make you incredibly sick .
another thing it &apos;s good for is navigation — it can guide you around in a city .
so , the way of treating these diseases in early times was to , in some way or other , exorcise those evil spirits , and this is still going on , as you know .
this is based on an f. scott fitzgerald short story .
the president dismissed the secretary of state , whom he was conferring with , and asked the dentist if he would remove a tooth .
so we collect this mr.
so , but i think whether you own your own company or you &apos;re just starting out like me , like something like this is so vital for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning .
and my , then , five year-old daughter was helping me in the way that five year-olds do .
but if i think about it , i thought i wanted a husband , but what i really wanted was a family that was loving . and i fiercely love my children , and they love me back . &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; i thought that i wanted to be a doctor , but what i really wanted to be was somebody who served and healed and cured .
so what we can do , again , using spatiotemporal features , we looked at every shot .
but there is not a day that goes by where i am not so grateful to be married to this man ; where i &apos;m not so grateful for the possibility of changing minds , and rewarding conversations , and creating a world where love belongs to us all .
so , that &apos;s a challenge , not just for organs but also for tissues .
a couple months later , news of this proposal got leaked to the press and now there are thousands of articles , over 10,000 articles , on this star alone .
and this is : how do you make a teacher great ?
he was 11 years old , and i met him exactly four months after his accident .
the twist is that one player , on the left , is informed about how much on each trial there is .
i remember one night when someone phoned me on my cellphone — ordinary person who i don &apos;t know — from tahrir square .
it was in constant flux , and we had to , rather than fight it , embrace it , see where the milk would take us and compensate to make it even better .
actually , you have to put a circle around that , and call it business .
sometimes you can make some horrible choices with them .
and i think this is partly where there is such a divide of opinion , that there &apos;s a lot of people in this room and around the world who think very differently about the internet .
learning the information that has accumulated over time and reading the message left by my ancestors were better than any consolation therapy or piece of advice any living adults could give me .
there were 8,000 kinds of notes in america .
if every commercially minded cosmetic surgeon were tied end to end along a railroad track , that would be me , stoking the train without a qualm in the world .
could you imagine how i felt in that moment ?
they &apos;re very little understood .
he says , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t hate the media . be the media . &quot; &quot; i &apos;m an artist .
so in 1900 , as you can see , we were well within the limits of safety .
this is a very sort of un-shark-like photograph .
fireworms scrawl white lines as they feed .
they sort of say the harsh news , that we are facing the largest transformative development since the industrialization .
we &apos;re in the age of the super pac .
bc : and on the front of it is this heat shield , this saucer-looking thing that has about a half-inch of essentially what &apos;s cork on the front of it , which is our heat shield .
and huck gets on the raft with a property named jim , a slave , see .
here is earth as a pale blue dot .
imagine what happens when the cost of getting information from anywhere to anywhere is close to zero .
and they survived , but they were heartbroken , and i &apos;m not sure my dad ever really got over leaving vienna .
in fact , if you were having sunday lunch , the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window about three days earlier .
our government is us .
this is a common occurrence . governments everywhere are often trying to block and filter and censor content on the internet .
these countries took those strategies i just showed you ; the community engagement , the case finding , contact tracing , etc . , and they turned them on their head .
had something gotten in his wound that killed him ?
does anyone here know the company multi-health systems ?
so really , just an amazing image , slowed down extremely , to extremely slow speeds .
so this is important .
second of all , we should really strive to use far less energy in creating these materials .
charles used to say , &quot; &quot; the extent to which you have a design style is the extent to which you have not solved the design problem . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s kind of a brutal quote .
big scribbles .
the reality , unfortunately , is a little different , and it has a lot to do with trust , or a lack of it .
they &apos;re already the largest trading nation , already the largest exporting nation , already the largest manufacturing nation , and they &apos;re also the biggest emitters of carbon in the world .
the way we expect the world to be changes the way we see it .
i ordered them ; they came by fedex .
so this is a mental picture , i &apos;m describing a mental , vivid picture that enables dancers to make choices for themselves about what to make .
and this is a one-pound baby .
small roundabouts are starting to appear .
and when we were walking through the narrow alleys , it was literally impossible not to step in the raw sewage and the garbage alongside the little homes .
and the odds are seven to one against your finding the prince .
it &apos;s opt-in . you might even get texas and south carolina , who didn &apos;t opt into the education race to the top , you might even get them to opt in . why ?
dr. samuel cartwright graduated from the university of pennsylvania medical school .
they &apos;re not the largest number of people , but they are some of the most expensive — and in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse , drug and alcohol abuse , poor performance by their kids in schools and also poor health as a result of stress .
i learned new characters every day during the course of the next 15 years .
and this is where i have to query all of you .
and finally , lots of people are saying that yemen &apos;s revolution is going to break the country .
it pays for itself within one year .
and this actually fits with another interesting theory about what &apos;s happening in authoritarian states and in their cyberspace .
and that little square in the corner , a naught .7 percent , that &apos;s the amount we &apos;re actually aware of .
i &apos;ve got a question for randi .
you end up isolated if you don &apos;t cultivate the capacity for solitude , the ability to be separate , to gather yourself .
i run a design studio in new york .
and like the rest of the brain , it &apos;s made of neurons .
indeed , to implement the slogan of health for all , we will need to involve all in that particular journey , and in the case of mental health , in particular we would need to involve people who are affected by mental illness and their caregivers .
so , this simple narrative equating western demand and chinese suffering is appealing , especially at a time when many of us already feel guilty about our impact on the world , but it &apos;s also inaccurate and disrespectful .
the us defense department has long warned of consequences from the climate crisis , including refugees , food and water shortages and pandemic disease .
it is not a sprint .
now , what we need is , we need people who will be able to scale them up .
so that &apos;s what we &apos;re interested in looking at in my lab .
and remember , paths crossed in 1984 , and more and more women were dying of cardiovascular disease .
so he asked me , could he please visit me , and then finally he did , and explained to me that what i did now in my shop was an anachronism , that the industrial revolution had broken out , and that i rather should join the factory .
this is fourier &apos;s law of heat conduction .
and no two people could disagree about what the word free was and what the word falafel was , behind us , &quot; &quot; free falafel . &quot; &quot; you know .
so we &apos;re talking about an investment that in terms of impacts on the state economy is not going to really pay off for 15 or 20 years , and of course america is notorious for being a short term-oriented society .
i felt so incredibly grateful for my life .
so that being said , it &apos;s highly unlikely that any jellyfish would survive that long in the wild .
we talked to pharmaceutical companies .
can i do that one again ?
it must be a machine . &quot; &quot; so i says , &quot; &quot; ok then , if you say it &apos;s a machine ... &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) ( applause ) that one took me approximately six weeks . ( applause )
a chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters .
we found remains of giant predatory dinosaurs , medium-sized predatory dinosaurs , and seven or eight different kinds of crocodile-like hunters .
this is a serious business .
additionally , these sort of edenic places are often distant from where people live .
iraq will still be the second largest oil producer in the world , behind saudi arabia .
and , you see , this era coincided with my own childhood .
i believe that these tools that worked in these 42 pilot cases can be consolidated in standard processes in a bpo kind of environment , and made available on web , call-center and franchise physical offices , for a fee , to serve anyone confronted with a demand for a bribe .
( laughter ) now , i &apos;m convinced a lot of you probably share my passions , especially my passion for &quot; &quot; judge judy , &quot; &quot; and you &apos;d fight anybody who attempted to take her away from us , but i &apos;m a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life , a passion for the live professional performing arts , performing arts that represent the orchestral repertoire , yes , but jazz as well , modern dance , opera , theater and more and more and more .
first of all , we wanted small schools — about 300 , 400 pupils — 14 to 19 year-olds , and critically , about 80 percent of the curriculum done not through sitting in classrooms , but through real-life , practical projects , working on commission to businesses , ngo &apos;s and others .
and therefore , it &apos;s not a matter of opinion .
i believe in you .
that &apos;s the challenge . okay , so , now , what we — in the journey of wheat , let &apos;s go back and look at these 12 stages .
so this is target , the company .
this cooperative ability has interesting implications for economic planning and a variety of other fields .
that &apos;s my daughter and me .
&quot; &quot; enjoy the gravity on hd 40307g , a super-earth . &quot; &quot; this planet is more massive than earth and has a higher surface gravity .
more than 700 of these boats , which are fishermen boats repurposed with oil absorbent in white and oil containment in orange , were used , but they only collected three percent of the oil on the surface , and the health of the cleaners were very deeply affected .
and when we did , my dad would say , &quot; &quot; can you believe someone climbed a tree over there , picked this thing off it , put it in a truck , drove it all the way to the docks and then sailed it all the way across the atlantic ocean and then put it in another truck and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house , so they could sell it to us for 25 cents ? &quot; &quot; and i &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t believe that . &quot; &quot; and he &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t believe it either .
for two straight days , the city became an open battlefield between the federal forces and a well-organized group , presumably from the local criminal organization , la familia michoacana , or the michoacán family .
thank you .
the breaks got fewer and fewer .
nowadays , there are computational systems that can suss out emotional states and even lying from processing human faces .
well , we haven &apos;t done that , so we can &apos;t really expect to find an answer when we &apos;re still afraid of the question .
( applause ) the coolest thing about this — and this is what &apos;s completing the whole circle — is that in april of this year , at the geffen moca in downtown los angeles , there &apos;s going to be an exhibition called &quot; &quot; art of the streets . &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; art of the streets &quot; &quot; is going to have pretty much the bad-asses of the street art scene — banksy , shepard fairey , kaws — all of these guys will be there .
i &apos;m going to start with glenn gould .
so here are the graphs you &apos;ve seen lots of times before .
( laughter ) ( applause ) when we looked at the data , and we met with the staff , there were many excuses for why strawberry mansion was low-performing and persistently dangerous .
sort of eavesdrop on the activity of nerve cells in the brain .
this is a point cloud .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s nice about emotion .
the data came back from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and it was all the same : no correlation , no connection , none at all .
ak : so , can you tell us a little bit , jeff , about where you are ?
they want to work , they want to study , they want to be able to continue their lives .
would you want your mother , your brother , your sister to get a placebo if they had advanced lung cancer and had weeks to live ?
last year , volkswagen announced that by next year they &apos;ll be producing this carbon fiber plugin hybrid getting 230 miles a gallon .
and the reason was that i have never , never seen the names of my sisters written on any document .
this airport alone covers more than 100 square kilometers .
it was founded in the eighteenth century , the largest psychiatric hospital in the state of connecticut , other than the huge public hospitals that existed at that time .
one perspective is , it &apos;s a sum .
ok , let &apos;s take a very quick look at the top 100 companies in the london stock exchange in 2016 .
and my mum said , &quot; &quot; darling , remember that you can &apos;t see and you can &apos;t feel the picture and you can &apos;t feel the print on the page . &quot; &quot; and i thought to myself , &quot; &quot; but that &apos;s what i want to do .
well , then let &apos;s go to a simpler explanation .
is there a place for me in the world out there ?
it was not going to work , so i decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had , at least some of them , had to also be moved through a hole that we could open up again in that wall and begin feeding the appropriate nonhuman animals through that hole onto the other side of being legal persons .
and an hour or two later , if i saw her , she &apos;d come over to me and she &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; bryan , do you still feel me hugging you ? &quot; &quot; and if i said , &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; she &apos;d assault me again , and if i said , &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; she &apos;d leave me alone .
but what is the international aid community doing with africa today ?
so let me end with some thoughts about model building .
there are two sources of information bayes &apos; rule tells you .
but i think , you know , we have to accept that we are just machines .
because there is something fundamental here that i think overrides the rest , and it is about our common humanity .
and they were excluded from decision-making , and now they are in the forefront of the news , raising the flag .
i end now with the world .
they &apos;re smaller questions , but they are not that small .
it &apos;s similar to other nutritional diseases .
even now we are in touch through facebook .
but other countries in europe , notably the nordic countries , are showing that it &apos;s possible to have a kick-ass economy without being a workaholic .
it would mean that , even before birth , mothers are warning their children that it &apos;s a wild world out there , telling them , &quot; &quot; be careful . &quot; &quot; let me be clear .
i &apos;m half egyptian , and i &apos;m muslim .
there &apos;s still 13 trillion dollars circulating in the u.s. economy .
and i think , actually , that &apos;s already really happening .
let me show you this .
but also — and this is so important — to communicate their despair , to say , &quot; &quot; we &apos;ve tried this and it doesn &apos;t work , and what shall we do ? &quot; &quot; and then , lo and behold , there &apos;s another group answering these kids who may be in america , or maybe this is a group in israel , saying , &quot; &quot; yeah , you did it a little bit wrong . this is how you should do it . &quot; &quot; the philosophy is very simple .
here is not like anywhere else .
here it comes at you in real speed . you &apos;ll hear this .
and that creates a big problem .
we said , all right , let &apos;s , you know , throw so problems at holly , see if she messes these things up .
fg : no .
as we speak , there are 117 or so clinical trials researching the use of stem cells for liver diseases .
and also you can see the water is brown , the mud is brown and oil is brown , so when everything is mixed up , it &apos;s really hard to see what &apos;s in the water .
95 percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking , and that &apos;s because the precipitation patterns and the temperature patterns are changing .
in other words , you &apos;re certainly fast-forwarding this whole process of a billion people going to prosperity .
that makes me furious .
and i promise to you , this was such an important moment in my career , when i realized that the great leader believed in young people and new ideas .
measurement is the lifeblood of science and progress .
they undertook a study of autism prevalence in the general population .
yes , it &apos;s a little boring , but some people kind of get into the zen of it .
since 2001 , we &apos;ve interviewed hundreds of thousands of people — young and old , men and women , educated and illiterate .
so i decided to build a prototype .
and it &apos;s truly awesome and wondrous .
finished university education , got a medical degree , 1986 .
no magic . no secret . it &apos;s just love .
they &apos;re disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well .
and i faced a whole new set of challenges .
and further , he found a similar response in more or less the same location in 10 out of 12 subjects .
but , you know — is this actually dramatically changing love ?
a self-organizing system is one where a structure appears without explicit intervention from the outside .
genius .
they began as very local and specific .
he could not probably give the right kind of love for you , but for us , he has given the people the right kind of love , that is important .
tie game with five seconds left .
and mike , who i met at galapagos , a trip which i won at ted , is leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling his journey through cancer .
it &apos;s much more easy to build hybrids .
this is actually a disservice , because whales are ecosystem engineers .
( applause ) bruno giussani : yuval , you have a new book out .
in the sars epidemic , we learned in hong kong that most of transmission was because people were removing their masks improperly .
progress happens when all the factors that make for it are ready and then it is inevitable . &quot; &quot; 2007 . the iphone makes it debut .
it is displaying data that exists already in a different way , to amplify it , to provide cues to the doctors , to the nurses , so they can see what &apos;s happening .
and i think this is one level deeper , and it &apos;s actually a requirement for changing your perspective .
our goal , quite simply , is that every single judge in the united states will use a data-driven risk tool within the next five years .
okay , africa .
&quot; okay , &quot; i thought , &quot; here &apos;s a first world country , let &apos;s see what they can do . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a speleologist , that means a cave explorer .
this is not james , this is one of the kids that he works with .
and in short order , the cooperators are done for .
thank you .
we &apos;ve tried various approaches , paring it down to minimal components .
it &apos;s a vast , impersonal , uncaring force of nature that is not affected by our wishes or desires .
so what if there were not only an internet of information , what if there were an internet of value — some kind of vast , global , distributed ledger running on millions of computers and available to everybody .
it &apos;s almost 80 million years old .
and the first of these is to connect , is that your social relationships are the most important cornerstones of your life .
now , if we take a step back and think about these other two really important advantages : one is improved immune responses through delivery , and the second is getting rid of the cold chain .
so i looked , and like the thousands of people that had tried before , i found nothing .
and to me , this is research misconduct .
but the key thing here is , what do you think should be in the new goals ?
alejandro aravena : i don &apos;t know if you were able to read the subtitles , but you can tell from the body language that participatory design is not a hippie , romantic , let &apos;s-all-dream-together-about- the-future-of-the-city kind of thing .
so i think in the next decade , the sciences and the humanities will come closer together to be able to answer deep questions about mankind .
be prepared to find vocations that make you useful to your neighbors and to your fellow citizens .
and that disparity struck me as this incredible intellectual and moral puzzle .
i &apos;m not here to make an indictment of democracy .
well the moon is casting a shadow down on the earth .
and — ( laughter ) they — they &apos;re invented around the same time . i think beer came first .
the chimps are playing better than the humans , better in the sense of adhering to game theory .
despite implicit and explicit questions of my right to be in an elite space , i &apos;m proud to report that when i graduated , i was the first black woman to earn a phd in astrophysics in yale &apos;s then 312-year history .
( laughter ) that &apos;s good , wake up , wake up , wake up .
in 2016 , it is the dimension of our being itself that cries out for its fair share of our imagination .
i &apos;m sick to death of this old cell phone .
they &apos;ve all defined the terms on which they will accept bookings .
what if there isn &apos;t enough clean air and fresh water ?
the doha tribeca film festival was held at our new cultural hub , katara .
how did hippomenes beat her ?
i made the front page of my hometown paper that i delivered for six years , you know ?
and then from hour to hour we rot and rot .
ms : and just like that , one by one , all of these companies suddenly disappeared .
it was my version of my grandfather &apos;s hours of the day alone in his library .
she organized a tedx action out there and made all the unseen faces of the city on the walls in her town .
the one thing we need to do is we have to replace these inefficient incandescent light bulbs , florescent lights , with this new technology of led , led light bulbs .
as you can see , one of our parties , you know , a few years ago .
so this past spring , as i was gearing up to begin writing a biography of muhammad , i realized i needed to read the koran properly — as properly as i could , that is .
it &apos;s more than that ; it &apos;s deeper .
here &apos;s what we do .
they explored the keyboard . they played around with it .
no knock on the neuroscientists .
now , put them on both cups .
this shapes how we think about our health , our relationships , how we decide how to vote , what we consider fair or ethical .
in 2005 , the egyptian stock exchange returned over 145 percent .
these electrodes act like mini pacemakers to get the cells to contract in the lab .
the men knew that the nearest islands they could reach were the marquesas islands , 1,200 miles away .
you &apos;re not from kenya .
and you even find a church .
by the way , dsl is a kludge .
and it really works to start with them .
and then they strike out across the ocean , down to kenya .
their behavior in terms of the underlying changes that are going on in their brain .
i drew it during the few hours of electricity we get .
many people in mexico are afraid today .
so the data has since been used by groups like human rights watch on its recent report on these types of sting operations .
there is a decent contribution to happiness from the genes — about 50 percent — but there is still that 50 percent that is unaccounted for .
the third thing is again cities .
how about we do this whole hill now ?
( laughter ) well , bob russell was telling us about his work on nanotubes in his research at the microscopic level .
the mission is not yet complete .
why is it that somebody might literally see the glass as half full , and somebody literally sees it as half empty ?
that &apos;s what the surgeon is saying in the operating room when the patient &apos;s on the table .
my opinion is that the mossad is involved , but that the leading force is not israel .
our hospitals have an explicit policy called age-based allocation of healthcare resources .
they are inaccessible to our senses but can be seen through mathematical lenses .
&quot; no , no , what you talking about ? &quot;
as she recounts : &quot; &quot; on the third day of creation , god commands the earth to grow a fruit-bearing fruit tree . &quot; &quot; for this first fruit tree , there was to be no differentiation between trunk , branches , leaves and fruit .
so how does it happen ?
and i think that &apos;s how we got to become human .
so , this talk is going to be about how do we make things and what are the new ways that we &apos;re going to make things in the future .
and what you &apos;re looking at is a paper form in the hand of a ministry of health nurse in indonesia , who is tramping out across the countryside in indonesia on , i &apos;m sure , a very hot and humid day , and she is going to be knocking on thousands of doors over a period of weeks or months , knocking on the doors and saying , &quot; &quot; excuse me , we &apos;d like to ask you some questions .
it &apos;s not a purely visual technology .
an important key insight that we learned about meetings is that people pack them in one after another , disruptive to the day .
it was like it was yesterday .
( laughter ) so , we &apos;re looking at the same criteria as most people — you know , can i afford it ?
and when the kindergarten kids recently moved their gate , they found out the fence was made out of tapioca .
and it &apos;s kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse , except that you &apos;re now running a string of these things down .
it was invented by russell smith , a passionate inventor in new zealand who was trying to help blind people .
and here we find that we can use these systems to test the application of this technology in particular tissues , for example , figuring out how to deliver the crispr tool into cells .
it was kind of along these lines , and the allegation was that i have , quote , &quot; &quot; affection for terrorists . &quot; &quot; now , the good news is that the person who said it was ann coulter .
they exist only to foster fear and promote transphobia .
we experimented on ourselves .
nothing that you would call architecture , right ?
this is how we landed for the most important meeting of the world &apos;s leaders in china .
and we have taken pictures like this .
it &apos;s like a rodeo show . they all get a ride on the machine , and they get rewarded for how fast or how far they can make the machine move forward .
they decided that wasn &apos;t good enough , so they went to india and studied the indian state of kerala that also had a system like this , and they adapted it for ethiopia .
and that &apos;s retirement homes on the west coast of florida .
it would have taken the three of them a very long time , especially given that none of them are actually from honolulu .
so i decided to contact you myself , for you to assure me of safety and honesty , if i have to entrust any amount of money under your custody .
he was 20-some years older than anybody else in the sample .
a metaphor will serve here : where elite mathematicians and statisticians and theorists often serve as architects in the expanding realm of science , the remaining large majority of basic applied scientists , including a large portion of those who could be said to be of the first rank , are the ones who map the terrain , they scout the frontiers , they cut the pathways , they raise the buildings along the way .
so we have this field of science that &apos;s all about slime , and color changes . check this out .
it &apos;s making a little bit fun of getting older , and , you know , people might like it .
late pick-ups went up every week for the next four weeks until they topped out at triple the pre-fine average , and then they fluctuated at between double and triple the pre-fine average for the life of the fine .
but kund , which uses the gypsum belt , for that you have to go back to your calendar , three million years ago .
i want to close with just two points .
we have more and more time-saving devices , but sometimes , it seems , less and less time .
they can &apos;t fish there for a radius of 200 miles .
looking at an individual is about 3,000 dollars . and the parent of a child with asperger &apos;s disease , the high-intelligence autism , had sent his thing to a conventional company ; they didn &apos;t do it .
this man , joel salatin , they call him a lunatic farmer because he grows against the system .
♫ and the sum of invisible power ♫ ♫ had a name . ♫ ♫ it &apos;s the same name . ♫ ♫ tembererana , hey , tembererana ... ♫ ♫ da , da , da , da , da , da , da ♫ ♫ tembere , tembere , tembere , tembererana ♫ ♫ tembere , tembere , tembere , tembererana , hey ♫ ♫ tembererana , hey ♫ ♫ tembererana ... ♫ ( applause )
and right beyond the historic bridge that you can see here , right next to the plaza , you can see that the river looked like a river of trash .
here &apos;s another group .
a professional psychic who speaks to dead people , she can &apos;t reach me ?
even when you &apos;re standing in front of a megaphone , it &apos;s pretty much every direction .
and we &apos;ve been getting a lot of takers . one is the rock &apos; n &apos; rollers .
we also have a classroom hives project , where — this is a nonprofit venture — we &apos;re spreading the word around the world for how honeybee hives can be taken into the classroom or into the museum setting , behind glass , and used as an educational tool .
in the united states , efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population .
and if you look at these figures for the more developed markets like u.k. , germany , and so on , they &apos;re actually much lower .
they were both only children who chose not to have kids .
that &apos;s 38 stories tall .
thanks very much .
this probably is : the aral sea .
when i made it to the halfway mark , at eight minutes , i was 100 percent certain that i was not going to be able to make this .
so i &apos;m going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas .
and those who do , on average , wait 11 months to make the report .
two weeks later , the police stopped them .
and gould &apos;s specialty was playing bach .
and that &apos;s why , next month in morocco , a meeting is taking place between all the countries .
is agriculture adapted to that ?
it doesn &apos;t make them good people , but it &apos;s at the heart of engineering , at the heart of a creative community , an innovative community , and the open source community , the basic ethos of it is , take what other people do , make it better , give it back so we all rise further .
but just because a system is sick doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s dying .
yet , no amount of diplomacy or institutional design can make up for local failures and the consequences that they have .
you can say a person is lying .
and why this is so important is that we now have grown a generation , maybe two , of kids where one out of every four meals is eaten in fast food , one of every four meals is eaten in a car and one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a tv or computer .
now , if you think about democracy from this perspective , a new pluralistic notion of democracy would be one that recognizes that there are many different interests , many different agendas , many different individuals , many different points of view .
and at my feet was the great , still blue plate of the pacific ocean .
the phones were there . but the expectation was once you moved in there your commitment was fully to the task at hand , fully to the people around you .
you do it again and again .
we don &apos;t have to like each other — and sometimes we really don &apos;t like each other .
kids made hamburger cards that were made out of construction paper .
that &apos;s another contradiction — science and art don &apos;t often go together , but interweaving them can help these girls bring their whole selves to what they learn , and maybe one day join the ranks of astronomers who are full of contradictions , and use their backgrounds to discover , once and for all , that we are truly not alone in the universe .
a maybe that could take the form of a gas or a liquid .
it &apos;s actually pretty busy .
so instead of going to coffee meetings or fluorescent-lit conference room meetings , i ask people to go on a walking meeting , to the tune of 20 to 30 miles a week .
what &apos;s going to happen over time with that ?
( laughter ) that &apos;s why the mascot of internet engineering , if it had one , is said to be the bumblebee .
and following that basic idea of the village , we changed it as we got into it .
pucker up big and lean in just a little bit , okay ?
now , if the dna sequences match , they &apos;ll stick together , and so we can look at spots .
hello , australian federal cabinet .
so we &apos;ve teamed up with the decoder of the human genome , craig venter , and the company he founded with peter diamandis , the founder of the x prize , to genetically modify the pig genome so that the pig &apos;s organs will not be rejected by the human body and thereby to create an unlimited supply of transplantable organs .
that &apos;s pretty clearly not a good thing .
w1 : they suck .
so there is a lot of emotional communication that happens there .
but a few made it anyway , despite our best efforts , and now it &apos;s time for us to thank them for the work they did and give them every chance they have to raise the coral reefs of the future , their coral babies .
and , even more importantly , since this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture , we can shoot emily in just part of an afternoon , in many different facial poses and facial expressions .
one is that you and i all have between 30 to 50,000 chemicals in our bodies that our grandparents didn &apos;t have .
there are many questions i could not understand , and there are some questions i did not want to understand .
sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise , once clockwise and peck the key twice .
we have the human systems of how we communicate and interrelate and have our whole constructed society , we have the industrial systems , which is essentially the entire economy , and then all of that has to operate within the biggest system , and , i would argue , the most important , the ecosystem .
( applause )
i wrote him back and said ...
we had a president , moi , who was a dictator .
i &apos;ve pirated the term system d from the former french colonies .
you see , there &apos;s a lot of things we just don &apos;t have data on .
and so i realized it was o.k. to go .
these are the kind of , you know , scenes that you remember and expect from &quot; &quot; jaws . &quot; &quot; and she &apos;s being eaten ; there &apos;s a shark .
and i &apos;d been to russia several times under the communists , and they &apos;d given me marvelous freedom that i didn &apos;t expect .
and that &apos;s a terrifying factor — when you start something and it turns that way — because it means that all that &apos;s left for you is to go back and to find out what the next thing is that you can push , that you can invent , that you can be ignorant about , that you can be arrogant about , that you can fail with , and that you can be a fool with .
so far we &apos;re taking the one , or up to five kilograms of output .
it &apos;s about how our brain is tricked into seeing a persistence of vision that creates a motion picture , and one of the things i had to do is , we — sasha baron cohen is a very clever , very smart guy , comedian , wanted to basically do an homage to the kind of the buster keaton sort of slapstick things , and he wanted his leg brace to get caught on a moving train .
okay , so you can see here the spot .
look at the industry for self-image and the jobs it creates , the revenue it turns over .
when we put people under a lamp for the equivalent of about 30 minutes of sunshine in summer in edinburgh , what we produced was , we produced a rise in circulating nitric oxide .
and so they needed to be able to quickly transform between different theater organizations , and for operational budget reasons , this actually no longer happens in pretty much any multi-form theater in the united states , so we needed to figure out a way to overcome that .
let &apos;s take a closer look in the united states .
you know what i &apos;m saying , just stand up there and answer some random questions ?
they came to detroit for a better way of life .
we used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts .
and they also , of course , had to get people to accept these so-called assets and pay money for them even though they were highly vulnerable .
your intuition might tell you that too .
and you &apos;re seeing a lot of things passing through its minds , a lot of self-models that try to explain the relationship between actuation and sensing . it then tries to do a second action that creates the most disagreement among predictions of these alternative models , like a scientist in a lab . then it does that and tries to explain that , and prune out its self-models .
we know that on mars and the moon there are tons of these structures .
to the trained eye , you can look at the roofs of these malocas , these longhouses , and see that there &apos;s cultural diversity .
she goes away with stars in her eyes about india , as a result .
we do exactly nothing to them until they &apos;re already two years old .
thank you .
so , what people were saying to me about the cause of cancer , sources of cancer , or , for that matter , why you are who you are , didn &apos;t make sense .
the final thing is , again just to reiterate that there &apos;s this practical part , and so we &apos;ve made these anti-quorum sensing molecules that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics .
so just because paper was invented before computers , it doesn &apos;t necessarily mean you get more to the basics of the subject by using paper instead of a computer to teach mathematics .
and when the great big parachute opened , we knew that if it didn &apos;t open there &apos;s a second parachute , and it runs on a nice little clockwork mechanism .
and the truth be told , this is it , isn &apos;t it ?
imagine somewhere in the world : mumbai , beijing , new york , london .
when i moved to harare in 1985 , social justice was at the core of zimbabwe &apos;s national health policy .
when researchers ask heroin addicts what &apos;s the toughest drug to quit , most say cigarettes .
we can &apos;t . what &apos;s great about the agile system is you build in a system of change so that you can react to what &apos;s happening to you in real time .
hey .
na : on twitter also .
very few people want to talk about death , and even fewer about children &apos;s death .
so what happens when a person gets a retinal degenerative disease like macular degeneration ? what happens is is that , the front-end cells die , the photoreceptors die , and over time , all the cells and the circuits that are connected to them , they die too .
so this is going to be a crash where they &apos;re going to slam this thing forward into a wall at 30 miles an hour , and see what happens . ok ?
so , climate change is not a new thing .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
the blood veins in our hands echoed a course of water traces on the earth .
we tend to think of business strategy as being a rather abstract body of essentially economic thought , perhaps rather timeless .
i was able to do more things .
and these older people come up to me now and they say , &quot; &quot; mr. stevenson , you give talks , you make speeches , you tell people to stop saying we &apos;re dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation &apos;s history after 9 / 11 . &quot; &quot; they tell me to say , &quot; &quot; no , tell them that we grew up with that . &quot; &quot; and that era of terrorism , of course , was followed by segregation and decades of racial subordination and apartheid .
and the thing that the ordinary afghan is most concerned with is — clare lockhart is here , so i &apos;ll recite a discussion she had with an illiterate woman in northern afghanistan .
as a scientist , i &apos;ve been a crew commander for a nasa mars simulation last year , and as an artist , i create multicultural community art all over the planet .
former guests from around the world had seen that the riots were happening just down the street , and wanted to check if he needed anything .
and suddenly everything looked different .
and fence line was amazing in itself .
but the distances on the universe are so large and the time scales are so large that it takes a long time for this to form .
and for handicapped , they can use this as a normal system .
( laughter ) you were born in new haven , connecticut .
here &apos;s how i think about it : sexting is like leaving your wallet at your boyfriend &apos;s house .
the economies of the future depend on that .
i just joined the points .
when i talk to people who didn &apos;t know me before the shootings , i have three challenges to meet .
so there &apos;s a pretty big gap there .
but in order for you to not just understand how this system works , but to also get personally connected to it , i decided to break the story down into several different narratives .
and the first automation wave in the 1970s .
we can &apos;t do that anymore .
for the first time , you &apos;ll have actors that really feel very interactive , that have real bodies that really react .
if the wind blows them over , they &apos;re like beetles stuck there on the ground .
and every citizen should be able to download an app that shows the population of drones and autonomous vehicles moving through public spaces around them , both right now and historically .
it &apos;s cold , it &apos;s eerie , it &apos;s misty , it might be raining , and you might be standing on the shores of lake michigan brimming with paint thinner . ( laughter ) that is the view that we had of the surface of titan before we got there with cassini , and i can tell you that what we have found on titan , though it is not the same in detail , is every bit as fascinating as that story is .
watch the animal .
the next day , the market started to change regime , course .
they have taught me a lot , and i &apos;d like to be able to share some of these observations with you .
to play a game in those days you had to have an imagination to believe that you were really playing &quot; &quot; battlestar galactica . &quot; &quot; the graphics were just horrible .
unknown in the west , this was the collected wisdom of an entire continent , the voice of africa at a time when africa was thought not to have a voice at all .
but what are we going to do about the monkeys and loss aversion ?
ma : well the interesting part was i was asked what it was like to be the first woman secretary of state a few minutes after i &apos;d been named .
it &apos;s a fact .
♫ we will be long gone by then ♫ ♫ in lackluster ♫ ♫ in dust we lay around old magazines ♫ ♫ fluorescent lighting sets the scene ♫ ♫ for all we could and should be being ♫ ♫ in the one life that we &apos;ve got ♫ ♫ everybody says ♫ ♫ time heals everything ♫ ♫ and what of the wretched hollow ? ♫ ♫ the endless in between ? ♫ ♫ are we just going to wait it out ? ♫ ♫ just going to sweat it out ? ♫ ♫ just going to sweat it out ? ♫ ♫ wait it out ♫
this is their lobby .
in fact , this whole area is like a yellowstone national park with all of the trimmings .
( applause ) dinosaurs are kind of funny , you know .
( applause ) and it &apos;s counterintuitive , but the cost of energy expended for the flight is only two cents of a dollar today , and we &apos;re just at the beginning of this .
alexander rose came up with this idea of a spiraloid tower with continuous sloping ramps .
i &apos;ve always been attracted to those rare people who pull that off , who devote their lives to humanity with the grit of the warrior and the grace of the mystic — people like martin luther king , jr . , who wrote , &quot; &quot; i can never be what i ought to be until you are what you ought to be .
so even more important than buildings in a city are the public spaces in between them .
what you &apos;re watching is a design of a robotic red blood cell , and it does bring up the issue that our biology is actually very sub-optimal , even though it &apos;s remarkable in its intricacy .
we did sort of a simulation , because you had video discs , and again , this is &apos; 76 .
now there are many ways you can get infected .
kevin shangraw : the iraqi people are who we are there to help — and we just killed one .
so you have to be prepared .
now , i &apos;m from new york , so it &apos;s 100 percent satisfaction here .
it was three feet off the ground , and they said , &quot; &quot; what is this ? &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; yeah , it &apos;s , i don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) they said , &quot; &quot; why have you put it there ? &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; just like that . &quot; &quot; and they said , &quot; &quot; can we touch it ? &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; if you wish to . &quot; &quot; and i went away .
to do this though , we need to redesign education in a major way , to balance depth with interdisciplinary communication , and explicitly train people how to contribute to , and benefit from other disciplines .
and what you see , at the lower right-hand side there , is a sample in which a single sample of blood has been put on the top , and it has gone through and distributed itself into these 16 holes on the bottom , in a piece of paper — basically it looks like a chip , two pieces of paper thick .
so , i will . here &apos;s the vision for ted .
bipolar disorder is nicknamed the ceo disease .
now , for us environmentalists , maybe the greenest thing about the cities is they diffuse the population bomb .
and so even if we make those very important decisions for very silly reasons , it remains statistically true that there are more georges living in georgia and there are more dennises becoming dentists and there are more paulas who are married to paul than statistically viable .
i play the part of a magician , a wizard , if you will , a real wizard .
so obviously , we have a q &amp; a portion of our program , and people line up to mics to ask questions .
this ice formed as snow 15,800 years ago , when our ancestors were daubing themselves with paint and considering the radical new technology of the alphabet .
i have this job interview in galena in 15 minutes , and i need this job , i &apos;ve got to go . &quot; &quot; again he asked me , &quot; &quot; what do you think we should do ? &quot; &quot; i &apos;m in high school . i have no idea .

and i &apos;m doing far , far less .
the day of the tsunami , he &apos;d actually been in charge of making sure the tsunami gates were closed .
they draw with crayons on the wall .
and behind the health is the educational level .
you know , we know that exercise remodels bone , but come on , none of us is going to exercise .
sm : but you know what ?
so , what i want you to think about for a few minutes is : how would you convey safety of the bmw ? okay ?
so we &apos;ll report on that later to see how well this goes .
it &apos;s because possibilities on this planet , they don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
tonight , i &apos;m going to share with you my passion for science .
to put that into perspective , this red vertical bar here marks the divergence time of humans from chimpanzees , a mere seven million years ago .
but if you &apos;re a geek like me , you say , &quot; &quot; well , what do the data say ? &quot; &quot; and you start to do things like graph things that we might be interested in — the total worldwide population , for example , or some measure of social development or the state of advancement of a society .
especially when chimpanzees , and other animals with large brains , are studied in captivity , modern technology is helping us to search for the upper levels of cognition in some of these non-human animals .
people used to say when they &apos;d come fund us , &quot; geoff , why do you provide these health services ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; a stranger is a friend i haven &apos;t met yet ! &quot; &quot; she &apos;d say to me .
well , it seems that when whales were at their historic populations , they were probably responsible for sequestering some tens of millions of tons of carbon every year from the atmosphere .
it recognizes that the market has its limitation , and so patient capital also works with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy to include all people .
we had this group there that was dedicated , three full-time guards , that was dedicated to go and stop it , but they just needed to know what was happening out in the forest .
the popcorn is illustrating a key thing in physics .
however , in 1994 , the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders , known as the dsm , thankfully — it &apos;s also the manual for mental health professionals — they redefined pms as pmdd , premenstrual dysphoric disorder .
his definition of jihad can now be expunged .
so that was also in the mix with the site the size of a football pitch .
when i press it again , it &apos;ll chirp three times , and that &apos;ll mean that it &apos;s armed and ready to go .
we , the audience , were given headsets and seated on one side of the terminal .
( laughter ) ( applause ) so i decided to use the israeli very famous technique you &apos;ve probably all heard of , chutzpah . ( laughter ) and the next day , i went and i bought two police scanners , and i said , &quot; &quot; the hell with you , if you don &apos;t want to give me information , i &apos;ll get the information myself . &quot; &quot; and we did turns , who &apos;s going to listen to the radio scanners .
it &apos;s a total media circus .
audience member 3 : yes it is .
did anybody watch &quot; &quot; blood diamond &quot; &quot; ?
why is it that they can withstand the loss of so much of their bark ?
these mountains are dangerous places , but ultimately the fate of these bear families , and indeed that of all bears around the north pacific , depends on the salmon .
so for instance , you can see that the scientific terms break down into two subcategories of the astronomic and the physics terms .
and then the important third dimension .
so after this amazingly fun conversation , ( laughter ) you might want to say , &quot; &quot; so , you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward ? &quot; &quot; absolutely . absolutely , i do .
in the summer of 2010 , there was a massive leak of classified documents that came out of the pentagon .
one is that it was a period when computers weren &apos;t yet for people .
this thing is orbiting the sun at 10 miles per second , 20 miles per second .
so what it &apos;s doing is , it &apos;s replacing the retinal circuitry , really the guts of the retinal circuitry , with a set of equations , a set of equations that we can implement on a chip . so it &apos;s just math .
you know , these economists , they love money , they want more and more of it , they want it to grow .
the second signal was for everybody to do jumping jacks together .
that evening , i came home to hundreds of hate mails , hundreds of people telling me how they could have lived another day without seeing this .
what goes in is what we are .
we don &apos;t borrow any energy from history .
it &apos;s made of silcon-coated glass fiber .
so during that moment when that woman was experiencing that pretend empathy , i was thinking , &quot; &quot; that robot can &apos;t empathize .
where does that leave you ?
judge forer had to follow the law .
we had to create a lighting system .
and i hope you &apos;ll think about it before you reject it out-of-hand .
just consider this : five million nights have been booked on airbnb in the past six months alone .
for many , their existence , their humanity , has been reduced to statistics , coldly recorded as &quot; &quot; security incidents . &quot; &quot; for me , they were colleagues belonging to that community of humanitarian aid workers that tried to bring a bit of comfort to the victims of the wars in chechnya in the &apos; 90s .
you may have seen this in other forms , but the top line is the amount of protected area on land , globally , and it &apos;s about 12 percent .
and that is what we think is happening .
you can see muscles pulling down at flesh to bring her eyebrows down .
td : so those were just a few remarks about my personal background .
by mid-century , we &apos;re going to have about eight billion — perhaps more — people living in cities or within a day &apos;s travel of one .
and as dan buettner can tell you , having a strong social network is so crucial to our health .
so what you want to focus on instead is allowing your lower body to draft behind your upper body , much like a small car behind a big car on the highway .
it works really , really well .
&quot; &quot; beauty ? i don &apos;t think i know what beauty is .
apollo 11 . are you kidding me ?
the typical answer to the question — we had to design 1,040 apartments — would have looked like this : 24-story height limit given by the planning authorities , 12 towers with nothing but residual in between — a very tight system that , although the tower isolates you , it doesn &apos;t even give you privacy , because you &apos;re so close to the next one , that it is very questionable what the qualities of this would be .
so for every digital renegade that is revolting in the streets of tehran , there may as well be two digital captives who are actually rebelling only in the world of warcraft .
and they will have the pleasure , many of them , of seeing those frogs that they &apos;ve raised from eggs and helped develop , helped nurture , move out into protected wildlands to augment the number of endangered species out there in the wild .
we have about a hundred , 120,000 others that don &apos;t appear to function every day , but represent this archival history of how we used to work as a species going back tens of thousands of years .
it &apos;s hard . it &apos;s durable .
he heard the heartbreaking stories about not just the damage that ebola did to people , but what it did to families and what it did to communities .
that is , you decrease the amount of dopamine , and their tendency to see patterns like that decreases .
they &apos;ve been killed on the street .
it hadn ’ t always been like this .
this is by a duo , michael abernathy and bud holland .
and the irs has introduced the program .
they &apos;re not going to get rid of us .
the retainer rings for the caps also have consequences for aquatic animals .
( applause ) now , i have some mini ted prizes , this is the philips bodygroom , one for our leader . ( applause )
so we need a new model .
it &apos;s like water bending around a rock in a stream , and all that light just destroys the shadow .
when my principal goes to a meeting at headquarters , these are exactly the things which are discussed . &quot; &quot; you see , what had happened was , over the last two decades , india had been fighting the challenge of access , having enough schools , and enrollment , bringing children into the schools .
and i was so disappointed , and i was like , &quot; oh my god , you know , what am i going to do ? &quot;
we shouldn &apos;t be threatening dissidents .
this is a pretty remarkable program using free and open source software , cheap , sort of hacked-together machines , and basically sort of abandoned buildings — has put together a bunch of community centers where people can come in , get high-speed internet access , learn computer programming skills for free .
nothing happened except that i got jaundiced from one of these things .
let &apos;s shift to a different kind of sea , the cyber sea .
i thought , what a great way to get to school .
ok , the next thing is — most of you , if you have a stable home life , and what i mean is that you don &apos;t travel all the time , and always in hotels , but most people have what we call a center of gravity .
( applause )
thank you .
june cohen : frank , that was beautiful , so touching .
they don &apos;t have the test scores , and there &apos;s a whole thing of trying to block the data .
one roman strategy that was very interesting was that — and it really gave them a comparative advantage — they made sure their soldiers didn &apos;t drink even remotely muddied waters .
and actually — so there are multiple uses of the bomb shelters .
it &apos;s spaces like these that spawned personal computing .
finally , location causes the feelings to move to their spots on a world map , giving you a sense of their geographic distribution .
he could not say no to anything , and that is why , that he cannot say no to things , we got this building today .
until last year , i &apos;d never kept bees before , but national geographic asked me to photograph a story about them , and i decided , to be able to take compelling images , i should start keeping bees myself .
and that provided the artistic director suddenly the ability to define suspension of disbelief .
anyway , please join me in teaching these values .
indra , a hundred .
how had no one noticed these children before ?
i &apos;ve stood at the deathbed of several famous people , whom you would know .
and i &apos;ll never forget the day i was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists .
she makes the most delicious food , that &apos;s fresh from the herbs in the surrounding countryside .
child mortality dropped by the most it had ever dropped in history .
a complete circuit of the indian ocean .
finally , my favorite student , she looks me straight in the eye , and she says , &quot; &quot; the reading sucked . &quot; &quot; and then she clarified . she said , &quot; &quot; you know what , i don &apos;t mean that it sucks . it means that i didn &apos;t understand a word of it .
the one way to discover about aliens is to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals .
these folk singers met at college at a gender studies program .
( applause )
i had left abc news and a career i loved at the age of 30 for business school , a path i knew almost nothing about .
and that is the species of organism that is responsible for causing cholera .
and i know you felt it because now , even now after all those years , you can still remember it .
every year , thousands of cochlear implants , diabetic pumps , pacemakers and defibrillators are being implanted in people .
she said , &quot; &quot; you are , because , see , it happens to everyone .
and i just find it so bizarre that she &apos;s suffering from the same thing that she tried so hard to protect people from .
there &apos;s no reason for me to make this talk more depressing than it needs to be . ( laughter )
but they detained me .
they &apos;re just not big enough .
and these guys are , like , serial offenders , and i &apos;m pretty sure everyone in this room has a refrigerator .
i &apos;m talking about , how do we secure the space , the demos , the platform of values , so that we can tap into all of your potential ?
i want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets .
&quot; can the brain build such a perception ? &quot;
i guess in plural it &apos;s scrotal , like medium and media .
and there are only seven of them .
think about drinking wine , about a journey to the clock of the long now .
let me leave you with one thought in closing .
the same can be said for our social systems , for our systems of government , where , at the very least , flow offers us a helpful metaphor for understanding what the problem is , what &apos;s really broken , and the urgent need that we have , that we all feel today , to redesign the flow of our institutions .
sorry , when people say &quot; &quot; i can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; they &apos;re usually talking about their own lack of imagination , and not about the unlikelihood of the event that they &apos;re describing .
and what is that , structurally ?
this is happy hour on the parking side .
we were very proud of this , particularly the title , which was &quot; &quot; eggbeater as centrifuge . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and we sent it off , and by return mail it came back .
the first group started in the study when they were sophomores at harvard college .
your baby is going to be hiv-negative . &quot; &quot; we view mothers as a community &apos;s single greatest resource .
and the trouble with that objection , it reflects a total misunderstanding of how much local economies involve everyone being interdependent .
and the most dangerous part of this is that is creates &quot; &quot; us &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; them , &quot; &quot; &quot; right &quot; and &quot; wrong , &quot; &quot; good &quot; and &quot; evil . &quot;
we pick them , we put them in cold storage , we gas the cold storage — there &apos;s actually documented proof of workers trying to go into these environments to retrieve an apple , and dying , because the atmosphere that they slow down the process of the apple with is also toxic to humans .
i went to visit canada , in british columbia , together with the chiefs of the forest services of other countries that we have a kind of alliance of them , like canada , russia , india , china , u.s.
well , that takes us to 65 .
i &apos;ve split kenya in its provinces .
it &apos;s , you know , sailing upon some land , and thinking , &quot; i think i &apos;ll draw that bit of land , &quot; and then wondering , &quot; &quot; maybe there &apos;s some more land to draw . &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s when learning really began for me .
the internet was supposed to homogenize everyone by connecting us all .
the blast is so strong it can even break your limbs , even if you &apos;re not hit .
you need the experience .
and i had songs , i had a playlist in my head — not through headphones , in my own head — of 65 songs .
children with birth defects were labeled incurables , and confined for life to inhuman conditions .
i led a team that was asked to imagine atlanta 100 years from now .
now , the shortcut . ( laughter )
this spring — there &apos;s a collider at brookhaven , on long island — this spring , it &apos;s going to have an experiment in which it creates black holes .
the same profile in the us , despite a momentary rebound 15 years ago , and despite all the technological innovations around us : the internet , the information , the new information and communication technologies .
it accepts that i &apos;m going to have to die but says , despite that , i can rise up and i can live again .
ca : until you got fired .
the war against terror , yes .
on average , women make less ambitious offers and get worse outcomes than men at the bargaining table .
and even now , as you memorize the order of the planets , something else is slipping away , a state flower perhaps , the address of an uncle , the capital of paraguay .
alicia ?
and the logistical tasks were daunting , because these were poor people .
you are paid to pick efficiency within a size class , in a way equivalent to looking at all fourteen years of life-cycle fuel savings rather than just the first two or three .
you know , every saturday and sunday , hundreds of thousands of people each fall gather in football stadiums to watch games .
this is an acryclic sphere .
and there &apos;s an ancient law that says you can &apos;t actually mention the word venereal disease or print it in public .
and there &apos;s been a tremendous increase in the temperature up there .
when this came out on television , the value of her art dropped to nothing .
but the other thing that i thought would be fantastic was to create these — call them &quot; &quot; prize targets . &quot; &quot; and so one could be for the best sustainable idea for an in-school project , the best one for a household project , or it could be the best community project for sustainability .
so that sort of space exploration thing is matched up here by the amount of content that &apos;s in there , and i think that amount is critical .
this is the official dogma , the one that we all take to be true , and it &apos;s all false .
and you &apos;ll all be able to use it and kind of explore what your own personal mythology might be .
he &apos;s a terrible producer of videos , but it &apos;s great content , so i &apos;m going to give you a little bit of it .
if you present with a diseased pancreas we &apos;d like to take cells from that organ .
i &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
and the pipa trust board holds that license and pays the country for this .
on the vertical axis , you &apos;ll see the distribution of children &apos;s choices in each condition , and you &apos;ll see that the distribution of the choices children make depends on the evidence they observe .
but when you &apos;re down here , where the psycho milts of the world are adding one photo at a time , that &apos;s institution as obstacle .
are they ever in equilibrium in the way that you see your work ?
america is as residentially and educationally segregated today as it was in 1970 .
&quot; &quot; friend &quot; &quot; used to be noun and then we verbed it .
( applause )
you absolutely know that when you &apos;re going to grab a cup , or that cup moves and you have to renavigate it .
we found that regardless of gender , country , religion , at two years of age , 30 percent lie , 70 percent tell the truth about their transgression .
then as time passed , at the end of almost two years , they thought , &quot; well , perhaps our father has died . &quot;
that is , they can disconnect fractally and then reconnect seamlessly .
what you &apos;ll see , in fact , is that it &apos;s using that half circle leg as a distributed foot .
this is a geodesic dome made of bamboo .
so torajans express this idea of this enduring relationship by lavishing love and attention on the most visible symbol of that relationship , the human body .
now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff , but it &apos;s a tiny drop of the durable goods that are disposed each and every year around the world — well less than one percent .
more and more chinese intend to embrace freedom of speech and human rights as their birthright , not some imported american privilege .
the only accusation i ever heard leveled at him was when one of our clients said , &quot; solly , you are pathologically helpful . &quot;
now — no , no , no .
her parents thought about it , and they finally , to their credit , decided to believe her .
soon , genetic breakthroughs and even better medicine are going to allow us to think of 100 as a normal lifespan .
this is one of the richest caves that we have found on the planet , anywhere .
we can even pick up the tiniest visual artifacts .
depthx is an all-seeing eyeball .
and electronic tattoos also shout .
now , let me now bring you to a wider picture , a wider picture of child mortality .
but these systems house millions and millions of other species , and that diversity is what stabilizes the systems , and it &apos;s where we &apos;re finding our new medicines .
in that same slum in nairobi , i met a young businesswoman , and she was making backpacks out of her home .
we &apos;re just trying to connect the two .
and then in an extraordinarily bart simpson-like , juvenile way you &apos;ve actually got to type out these words and get them right to reassert your freedom to speak .
so reconciling our need for security and our need for adventure into one relationship , or what we today like to call a passionate marriage , used to be a contradiction in terms .
he &apos;s illiterate , and he communicates with voice messages .
and the school cow is trying to figure out how to replace the lawnmower on the playing field .
your blood tries to boil . it &apos;s called vaporization .
and then i thought , all of us who have children love the children we have , with their flaws .
so , it &apos;s a very productive system .
if i do one magic trick move followed by another , the combination is a third magic trick move .
today , the average person has an astounding amount of personal information online , and we add to this online information every single time we post on facebook , each time we search on google , and each time we send an email .
now , courts and legislatures draw lines all the time .
i &apos;ve had to interrogate masculinity ; the toxic privileges that come with being a man don &apos;t define me , but i have to be accountable for how it shows up in my life every day .
it &apos;s not too much to say that what gutenberg did for writing , online video can now do for face-to-face communication .
and a third option is nuclear power .
let me , let me push the button . &quot; &quot; and grandma pushed the button , and she said , &quot; &quot; oh , fantastic !
if you &apos;re leaning forward , he will try and slightly change the neuro-linguistic nature of his face , because we went out with this strong idea : how can we make you believe that something &apos;s real ?
because only once before has the fate of individual people and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined .
and then over the summer , they &apos;re offered a summer job .
they cut out his tongue in mockery of his oratory , and no one knows what they did with his body .
it &apos;s bottom-up or grassroots power .
so thank you for your service .
and i &apos;d like to submit to you that we have sequenced the human genome , we know everything about the sequence of the gene , the language of the gene , the alphabet of the gene , but we know nothing , but nothing , about the language and alphabet of form .
and actually , i just finished leading a two-year project in this very special phase of a concept we call the starshade .
you see , africa makes a fool of our idea of justice .
thank you .
now , there may be more or less natural or artificial stimuli for the experience , but even that is a matter of degree , not kind .
we put it in eddie &apos;s sleeve , and so the hand that you see — i &apos;ll show you again , that &apos;s not eddie &apos;s hand , that &apos;s tom &apos;s .
because they &apos;re buying into it , and they &apos;re the ones who get to decide what they &apos;re going to do .
thank you .
well , back in 2001 , when there was just a simple test and a single dose of a drug , a nurse , in the course of her few minutes with a patient , would have to counsel for the hiv test , perform the hiv test , explain the results , dispense a single dose of the drug , nevirapine , explain how to take it , discuss infant feeding options , reinforce infant feeding , and test the baby — in minutes .
and professional designers were making artifacts with this thing strapped onto it .
that means every bad loan goes bad 47 times over .
they both have rhinoviruses ; we &apos;ve never seen this pattern in lab .
and the result has been just the same as in william muir &apos;s experiment : aggression , dysfunction and waste .
now i trained in medicine in india , and after that i chose psychiatry as my specialty , much to the dismay of my mother and all my family members who kind of thought neurosurgery would be a more respectable option for their brilliant son .
and i &apos;ll just never forget when i started working on exoplanet atmospheres 20 years ago , how many people told me , &quot; &quot; this will never happen .
unfortunately , just across the road from it or quite close by is the column of marcus aurelius , and the diameter of the dirigible makes an impression , as you can see , as she starts trying to read the story that spirals around the column of marcus aurelius — gets a little too close , nudges it .
and the preservation is , again , like those insects in &#91; amber &#93; , phenomenal .
he wrote as much in his journal .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
you &apos;ve heard about solar flares .
the first is : if society &apos;s to make any progress on this issue , we need an honest debate .
and in this tunnel , we use superconducting magnets colder than outer space to accelerate protons to almost the speed of light and slam them into each other millions of times per second , collecting the debris of these collisions to search for new , undiscovered fundamental particles .
so people continue to flee into neighboring countries , and we build refugee camps for them in the desert .
because for me , it feels like a fertile , creative medium .
that &apos;s two days ago .
it &apos;s very cold outside .
i was quite impressed by this feat , at how what was essentially just a bag of cellular slime could somehow map its territory , know itself , and move with seeming intention .
i asked her why her side makes such outrageous allegations and lies about my side .
now , if we have all these tools at our disposal , we simply have to ask the question , and thaler and sunstein have , of how we can use these more intelligently .
to reinvent life today , we have to make new forms of images .
you &apos;ve dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings .
it &apos;s only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them .
five students can be educated at aims for the cost of educating one in the u.s. or europe .
listen , my lab is not in the ear-manufacturing business .
students who are qualified for higher education , can afford , want to study , cannot because it is not decent , it is not a place for a woman .
( music ) the whole orchestra is playing . ( music )
i really believe that we still have a lot to learn about the normal structure and function of our bodies .
he &apos;s incredibly fast at it , too , faster than i am , in fact .
there are places in africa where they do the mining of jewels , and you go to the sand where the rivers have the sand go down to the ocean , and it &apos;s like literally looking at tiny jewels through the microscope .
we came up with a fantasy scenario of a dj traveling around the states , that would collect records and go on tours .
but today , after 60 years , because of the rise of entrepreneurship , entrepreneurs have become role models , and they are contributing hugely to the society .
that holds the long strand like this .
what &apos;s the goal ?
and we can &apos;t wait for the other guy . we have to do it ourselves .
i &apos;ve already told the people that we have tropical rain this time of year .
but in fact , women moving into the job market is having a huge impact on sex and romance and family life .
but you watch that movie enough times , and you start to realize how unusual it is .
you know , this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door , in your closet , and you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf .
in sangin where i was sick in 2002 , the nearest health clinic was within three days walk .
well we now know , of course , the answer .
so what we &apos;re looking at is the scene with the cyclist again , and you might notice in the bottom , we can &apos;t actually see the cyclist yet , but the car can : it &apos;s that little blue box up there , and that comes from the laser data .
i could try , but i can &apos;t .
it &apos;s a very violent process that is little known .
and detroit will make money on every unit .
so the stuff i &apos;m talking about is the peculiar problem of modern , affluent , western societies .
rendering authenticity — and the keyword is &quot; &quot; rendering . &quot; &quot; right ? rendering , because you have to get your consumers — as business people — to percieve your offerings as authentic .
and i was mentioning abed and myself , noting deliberately that i was here in peace , to the people in this town , when i met mohamed outside a post office at noon .
they introduced me to the new york city strategic alliance for health , again , free resources , don &apos;t waste them .
well , see , now i &apos;m thinking , i &apos;m in manhattan , this is a bad analogy , but most americans who don &apos;t live in manhattan get up in the morning and get in their cars and turn on that ignition , and their cars work , and they work incredibly well .
and my cousin , of course , the actor kevin bacon — ( laughter ) — who is my first cousin &apos;s twice removed &apos;s wife &apos;s niece &apos;s husband &apos;s first cousin once removed &apos;s niece &apos;s husband .
( applause ) but if you look at what we &apos;ve done , if you have the courage to really look at it , you &apos;ll see that not only do our kids think their worth comes from grades and scores , but that when we live right up inside their precious developing minds all the time , like our very own version of the movie &quot; &quot; being john malkovich , &quot; &quot; we send our children the message : &quot; hey kid , i don &apos;t think you can actually achieve any of this without me . &quot;
put them all together , and put all this under kind of natural selection , under mutation , and rewarded things for how well they can move forward .
as the novelty wore off , the months went by , there was some amount of tolerance , people got used to it .
so data is of course a massively useful tool to make better decisions , but i believe that things go wrong when data is starting to drive those decisions .
so when , as adults , we role-play , then we have a huge set of these scripts already internalized .
as a software developer and technologist , i &apos;ve worked on a number of civic technology projects over the years .
in a 2011 report from the institute for women &apos;s policy research , the gender wage gap between men and women was 23 percent .
for women without dense breasts , mammography is the best choice .
yes to life .
now , we wanted to see if we could actually record this on the track , so we headed down south to laguna seca .
what immense , if misplaced , creativity . right ?
and perhaps in life , movements get better through learning .
eh : tell us what happened when you were nine years old .
the rules of engagement : how to talk , when to talk , and how to deal with them .
( applause ) dm : as my mother said , we are the future hope , and the men are only killing in somalia .
so even with the slowing of the rotation of the earth and so on , the clock will keep perfectly good time .
so it turned into a dual celebration , because natasha was the first person from this village ever to go to the united states .
his name is brian eno .
&quot; you get her . &quot; &quot; no , no , you take her . &quot;
i just want to represent them in a beautiful light .
but certainly , it &apos;s going to be going to the unknown america .
this is a pharmaceutical ad .
you &apos;ve probably all read about it or heard about in some incarnation . let me give you a two-sentence version of it .
it wasn &apos;t about the end result .
also there is a lot of data that still needs to be collected .
now this is doubly ironic when you consider that what gives comedy its edge at reaching around people &apos;s walls is the way that it uses deliberate misdirection .
i &apos;ve spent 59 days on the back of a camel from chad to timbuktu .
i &apos;ll never forget the sound of laughing with my friends . i &apos;ll never forget the sound
but i needed the support of the village , and here again , when the men heard , and the people heard that a woman had gotten an opportunity to go to school , they said , &quot; &quot; what a lost opportunity .
i &apos;ve learned about the poetry and the wisdom and the grace that can be found in the words of people all around us when we simply take the time to listen , like this interview between a betting clerk in brooklyn named danny perasa who brought his wife annie to storycorps to talk about his love for her .
it turns out , almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photoreceptors , and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication .
and so i said , &quot; &quot; did you just move into this office ? &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; no , we &apos;ve been here about a year . &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; are you telling me that i am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year ? &quot; &quot; and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; yeah . or maybe you &apos;re the only one who had to go to the bathroom . &quot;
but in order for me to explain what that is , i need to spend just a couple of minutes talking more about cancer itself .
but i have to tell you — everybody always asks , &quot; &quot; what happened to the baby baboon ? &quot; &quot; it did die , and we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights .
that &apos;s because the ideology , the governing ideology of apple is the ideology of the perfectionist product designer in cupertino .
she would not stop trying to feed me penguins .
and i didn &apos;t like that war , i thought it was stupid .
you know , cadaver dissection is the traditional way of learning human anatomy .
they were sent out on the most dangerous missions and they sustained the highest combat casualty rate of any unit proportionally .
we got past the janitor .
and after even 30 years of doing this , after 30 years of exploring the ocean , i never cease to be amazed at the extraordinary encounters that i have while i &apos;m at sea .
it &apos;s the &quot; &quot; what &quot; &quot; detector .
and this is the first device that we did , and i &apos;m going to talk about my second wish , which has something to do with this .
when powerful people misused their privilege , we were going to get them .
first is the simple power of good visualization tools to help untangle complexity and just encourage you to ask questions you didn &apos;t think of before .
i wanted to think about what else i could put shadows on , and i thought of my friend bernie .
this was how computing began .
what if the cure for cancer or the answer the global warming lies in the head of a young female scientist who fails to progress ?
we told a security guard that she was missing , though she wasn &apos;t missing .
so i look up and i &apos;m thinking , maybe he &apos;s still going to think i &apos;m kind of cute . &quot; &quot; &quot; ma , are you still doing that ? &quot;
i can &apos;t get my father in italy to work on the internet .
so this problem is absolutely soluble .
what i take away , and this in some ways is the most important , he espoused and exhibited a reverence for dignity that was really , really unusual .
scientists , sort of at the end of the 20th century , learned that they could track blood flow to map non-invasively where activity was going on in the human brain .
because it &apos;s so cold , the entire contents of that hut is still as they left it , with the remnants of the last meal they cooked still there .
one has asperger syndrome . one has adhd .
that night she asked me , &quot; how come you are not joining the beauty pageant ? &quot;
it doesn &apos;t matter how hard i train , i &apos;m never actually going to get there .
that is going to be the price .
and there is a sound chamber .
this shows you a patent landscape .
these are choices that your grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are going to have before them .
so , part of this story , i think — well , it &apos;s a terrifying story , it &apos;s a very dark story and it &apos;s a story that continues on in many of the developing cities of the world .
anyway , i went home that night . i thought about it .
and they ended up naming the company warby parker .
so to just end up , there are things of suffering in the one billion poorest , which we don &apos;t know .
it had recently gone public and the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars , a number i didn &apos;t really understand .
( applause )
okay , india .
the interesting thing is that intuitive eaters are less likely to be overweight , and they spend less time thinking about food .
and what we learned was that we needed to think about redesigning courses .
that &apos;s also an insult to history .
to get from age zero to three was hard .
there &apos;s no question he &apos;s hitting above his weight .
tm : my mother &apos;s biggest concern when i transitioned was who was going to love me as i am .
and chris is a fisherman farmer . both are generalists .
this is one of the first results that came out of our study a little over a year ago that really surprised us .
now , this is dr. lene harbott applying electrodes to the head of john morton .
and i looked at word analysis .
all this would do is wreck a family .
( laughter ) ca : i guess , i don &apos;t think there is like a one-minute other piece you guys can do ?
for centuries , they &apos;ve been used to look at things like bacteria .
and they all treat learning , not as some sort of academic , analytical activity , but as that &apos;s something that &apos;s productive , something you make , something that you can do , perhaps earn a living from .
and the next six months of my life were the hardest time in my career , trying to design , build and deploy out in the field these 25 time-lapse cameras .
so these are all 3,214 pictures taken up there .
i &apos;m talking about dying .
a seemingly endless evolution of self and a community , but also this really deep desire not to leave anyone behind .
it &apos;s safe to say that we reimagined some traditions , but we also kept some old ones that we worked in , and we created something that worked for us .
and people magazine , i thought , got probably the best shot .
the data says it all the time .
i &apos;ll give you an example here .
but what are states and nations ?
( laughter ) rb : it &apos;s a tough job , isn &apos;t it ?
this caused major riots in my city .
two big storms and this notion of &quot; &quot; walk the walk &quot; &quot; prompted creation of elam back in 1998 .
( laughter ) and i had a choice in that moment , as all grenade throwers do .
who here has had surgery ?
if they &apos;re not working , put a shelf on it , which i did , and that shows all the customers my products .
and actually , private companies help governments with taxes .
it &apos;s not good .
nonetheless , when you hear real laughter and when you hear posed laughter , the brains are responding completely differently , significantly differently .
he had a lesser charge of forgery , got a year sentence and died a hero to the dutch people .
and this is actually a real photograph of earth taken by the voyager 1 spacecraft , four billion miles away .
ultimately , that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . &quot; &quot; why don &apos;t we all team up ? why don &apos;t we bring truce to life ?
why hasn &apos;t this happened sooner , and what can we do with it next ?
so was martin luther king , jr . so was dorothy day .
then it changes again .
everybody agrees with it .
and some of them were available . so , we hired one .
there is growing demand , growing population .
( laughter ) now , sylvia browne is an exception , an exception in one way , because the james randi educational foundation , my foundation , offers a one million dollar prize in negotiable bonds .
so here we are using 20 million barrels a day — producing eight , importing 12 , and from the 12 , five comes from opec .
if you ask people about what part of psychology do they think is hard , and you say , &quot; &quot; well , what about thinking and emotions ? &quot; &quot; most people will say , &quot; &quot; emotions are terribly hard .
it &apos;s all hidden in this code , and it &apos;s starting to be understood at breakneck pace .
this energy that is in your arm will not be in your legs .
in these seconds , your eyes are watching , left and right , left and right , and your brain wants those pictures to be identical .
and it &apos;s known for prostitution , violence , drugs : a hard place to grow up .
the head says there &apos;s a way forward .
we streamed data from the bedside instruments in their pediatric intensive care so that we could both look at the data in real time and , more importantly , to store the data so that we could start to learn from it .
and she created a dance piece which then prime minister nehru saw .
there &apos;s an effect on you and on your leaders .
this song is called &quot; &quot; the alphabet ...
integrative design can also increase energy savings in industry .
not infinite concentration of wealth , but the higher the gap between r and g , the higher the level of inequality of wealth towards which society tends to converge .
they would take the picture and then i would secret out from behind my robe a chocolate gold coin .
it &apos;s an actual thing .
this girl was raped repeatedly , forcefully penetrated with a blunt rod , beaten , bitten , and left to die .
that kind of makes sense to us .
don &apos;t do that .
so this is just one experiment that we published a few years ago , where a monkey , without moving its body , learned to control the movements of an avatar arm , a virtual arm that doesn &apos;t exist .
i just found this . what do you think we should do with it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t know , put it in the lost and found . &quot;
bone .
i &apos;m also interested in working with unusual materials and common materials in unusual ways .
creativity : it took creativity to solve the problem of getting all the thumbs into the node .
design thinkers believe that everyone is creative .
the same spot , it was a crime spot where people were being robbed .
it really goes beyond distinction .
if you want to know about africa , read our literature — and not just &quot; &quot; things fall apart , &quot; &quot; because that would be like saying , &quot; i &apos;ve read &apos; gone with the wind &apos; and so i know everything about america . &quot;
could you regenerate a limb ?
thank you .
and this blew his mind . literally . he checked into a sanitarium . ( laughter ) and when he came out of the sanitarium , he was convinced that he had been put on earth to found transfinite set theory because the largest set of infinity would be god himself .
and then , by using it in a targeted approach we &apos;re going to try to differentiate the machinery to recover function in old age .
so if you take the average commute time in america , which is about 50 minutes , you multiply that by the 120 million workers we have , that turns out to be about six billion minutes wasted in commuting every day .
have you heard of the idea of the mozart effect ?
was more than i could have hoped for .
but for the past eight years , i &apos;ve done something completely different .
and this is the kind of call that is used by , say , right whale mothers and calves as they separate to come back again .
so we took too many of them .
this is the nomadic dream , a different kind of american dream lived by young hobos , travelers , hitchhikers , vagrants and tramps .
i think black guys generally know where they &apos;re going .
i knew i would find her someday , or we would find each other .
she was born with very badly deformed back legs and pelvis .
it &apos;s the only threat , the only influence that the reef had to deal with .
first , no real sports fan would talk that way .
but you hit &quot; &quot; submit order . &quot; &quot; and two days later , this package shows up on your doorstep .
umar is seven years old , and he &apos;s from northern nigeria .
what &apos;s hard in our decision-making is when these two rules conflict .
maybe something like this .
that &apos;s what i thought — and i was shocked when i saw a picture of it .
no longer does aids need to kill two million a year .
there was a time when i considered wild soundscapes to be a worthless artifact .
if we think about drug treatment today , all the major breakthroughs — for hiv , for tuberculosis , for depression , for diabetes — it &apos;s always a cocktail of drugs .
so we have , in skin pigmentation , one of these wonderful products of evolution that still has consequences for us today .
what are some other metamorphoses that you &apos;ve had ?
( laughter ) okay , now that sounds a little flip , but make no mistake , the stakes are very high .
but , in fact , the print date was the early 1980s , when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me .
bg : thank you very much .
so i went to sleep , and that was it for me .
so we really can make changes .
and some states have differential policies , county by county .
so what about the poorest two billion ?
but then in the end , what i decided was every time you finish writing the word , i would stop and i would give the card to somebody on the side of the road .
so for now , let &apos;s turn to the evidence for dark matter .
this is perhaps the best picture i have .
i am sure , i am optimistic , that they will make cities better than our most ambitious dreams .
we think the world really looks like our buildings .
if you were not able to take the scoreboard out of the arena and be able to do the ice capades the next night , that would also be bad .
great , right ?
he grew up in a bohio of dirt floors , and the structure was the kind used by the tainos , our old arawak ancestors .
we are a bottom-heavy culture in more ways than one .
but hopefully , it was said with enough conviction that it was at least alluringly mysterious .
but maybe me , i give out something better because i give them hope . &quot; &quot; and in the middle of this economic crisis , where so many of us are inclined to pull in with fear , i think we &apos;re well suited to take a cue from jane and reach out , recognizing that being poor doesn &apos;t mean being ordinary .
that &apos;s not going to be happening , but you can see that the line comes down faster if they &apos;re not put under international pressure , if they &apos;re allowed to pursue their own devices .
that can &apos;t be energetically sensible .
philosophers have told us for thousands of years that the power to create is very closely linked to the power to destroy .
roman mars : according to the north american vexillological association .
the indians don &apos;t even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in india fill two or three gallons every time .
have you ever had a nagging feeling that one day you will be discovered as a fraud ?
i know the response to this .
we &apos;re not the first ones to build houses for our young .
but in this case it happened in real life .
mind your language .
the armillaria is actually a predatory fungus , killing certain species of trees in the forest .
and i tend to be a person who thinks too much and talks too little .
16 percent ! meaning that there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle , but only .16 percent of actual metastases — suggesting that maybe skeletal muscle is able to control the angiogenesis , is able to control the tumors recruiting these blood vessels .
but in fact , what they said was , &quot; &quot; leave doug and come down yourself .
it &apos;s the second world war .
the legends that you see in the movie don &apos;t appear for the monkey .
and this is an approach that &apos;s used all over the world , including in our lab .
( laughter ) okay . we are actually the first species on earth to be so prolific to actually threaten our own survival .
among the many memorable episodes of that retreat ... ( laughter )
so , we wondered : can we do anything useful with this capacity to control metabolic flexibility ?
on the path that american children travel to adulthood , two institutions oversee the journey .
so here &apos;s two sort of canonical neurons from a vertebrate and an invertebrate , a human pyramidal neuron from ramon y cajal , and another cell to the right , a non-spiking interneuron , and this is the work of alan watson and malcolm burrows many years ago , and malcolm burrows came up with a pretty interesting idea based on the fact that this neuron from a locust does not fire action potentials .
there &apos;s another one that throws plates and breaks them .
the u.s. attorney general recently released a report stating that they &apos;re going to ban solitary confinement in new york state for teens .
now , bluefin were revered by man for all of human history .
observe the upper-left one .
artificial intelligence used to be about putting commands in a box .
dh : right now ?
i had an awareness of being in my body , but also being out of my body , somewhere else , watching from above as if it was happening to someone else .
and i think this just shows how we were approaching the problem of incredibly large-scale construction .
and if you now try to cram 100,000 chimpanzees into oxford street , or into wembley stadium , or tienanmen square or the vatican , you will get chaos , complete chaos .
she is confined under the four walls of her home .
a committee of 12-year-old children would find out in 20 minutes that the most efficient way to use scarce road space is with exclusive lanes for buses .
it &apos;s not that hard a problem .
i think that &apos;s pretty exciting : tune-in literary fiction .
and the good thing about them is that they are deciding which houses go next .
we are graduating members from the class of we made it , not the faded echoes of voices crying out , &quot; names will never hurt me . &quot;
you and i can experience things without a story .
in that nine months , i went around the country and i talked to hundreds of people that were locked up , and i talked to many businesses that were also operating in afghanistan .
what we &apos;re done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wikipedia page and we reduced it down to a little summary .
the other things they &apos;ve worked on — i didn &apos;t have time to say this in my talk — is they &apos;ve restored functional hearing to thousands of deaf people .
the great success story of india , a country that so many learned scholars and journalists assumed would disintegrate , in the &apos; 50s and &apos; 60s , is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus .
we , after it &apos;s fermented and it &apos;s developed , started to develop flavor and character , we divide it into smaller units .
now i know there are people out there who will say that the election of barack obama meant that it was the end of racial discrimination for all eternity , right ?
this was one of the great things about my year , doing the sabbath , because i am a workaholic , so having this one day where you cannot work , it really , that changed my life .
we can &apos;t keep taking without expecting serious consequences as a result .
and this is maybe what explains why , for 30 years , he continued to make false papers at the expense of all kinds of sacrifices .
and here &apos;s the trick .
if australia disappears tomorrow , terror is probably the right response .
the biggest asset , in my opinion , one of the biggest assets in bertie county right now is this man : this is dr. chip zullinger , fondly known as dr. z.
or your memory sticks that you have now can carry one gigabyte of stuff on them — before , it was 256 .
it &apos;s all the things a phone should be .
i &apos;m going to be talking about designing humor , which is sort of an interesting thing , but it goes to some of the discussions about constraints , and how in certain contexts , humor is right , and in other contexts it &apos;s wrong .
especially when good things happen , and , in particular , when bad things happen .
this is where people make decisions , where they develop willpower .
in 1987 i heard of a story about a boy that fell through ice and was trapped under a river .
mohamed nanabhay who &apos;s sitting with us , the head of aljazeera.net , he told me that a 2,500 percent increase of accessing our website from various parts of the world .
edi , edi .
no life without tectonic activity , without volcanic activity .
( audio : &quot; &quot; mary had a little lamb &quot; &quot; ) and so , again , that sounds distorted , but what &apos;s really amazing here is that we were able to do this with something that you could literally run out and pick up at a best buy .
you know , it &apos;s the empathy and the compassion that comes out of having relationships with people who are different from you .
we &apos;re already starting to see early retirement occur this year .
and , for example , this — if we go back here — this has become surprisingly popular among composers finding musical forms by searching the computational universe .
you probably think of fbi agents gunning down bad guys like john dillinger , or arresting corrupt politicians .
in one famous example from decades ago , the management of vanity fair magazine actually circulated a memo entitled : &quot; forbidding discussion among employees of salary received . &quot;
and this is where i think we can take a leaf out of systems theory , systems engineers , where they create feedback loops , put the right information at the right point of time .
here &apos;s another example of how comparing to the past can befuddle our decisions .
finally , self-organizing systems , about which , again , i won &apos;t say too much because you &apos;ve been hearing all about it .
a victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement &apos;s use of images .
i should add that it &apos;s very simple to add things like hair , clothes , etc . , but what we &apos;ve done here is use a very simple visualization , so you can concentrate on the movement .
so they &apos;re crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second , and as they do so , they not only curve space , but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space , an actual wave on space-time .
what does it look like ?
but one day , something happened .
anybody know what this is ? it ’ s the peyote cactus .
yet it &apos;s one that &apos;s rarely asked .
cheeto paint is a very simple way to paint with cheetos .
this is the craft that was going on , but there are a few collectors who also collect art which can depreciate .
( laughter ) so we have the watches and the language , and you &apos;re detecting a theme here , right ?
but it &apos;s important to note that all of this retrofitting is not occurring — just bulldozers are coming and just plowing down the whole city .
why don &apos;t you let your family stay home , because you do know that you get a 30-day leave .
so on that frame , the children who are typical are watching this , the emotion of expression of that little boy as he &apos;s fighting a little bit with the little girl .
so when do you play baseball ?
what evidence is there for this ?
it &apos;s that acrid , tar-like flavor .
and then , only a week and a half ago , we flew over the north pole of titan and found , again , we found a feature here the size of the caspian sea .
( applause ) so we &apos;re building these buildings .
it &apos;s so much more subtle , so much more visceral — you know , what &apos;s visible , what &apos;s not .
so i just switched on in the train , loudly .
i know this . i &apos;ve spent most of my career researching these programs .
and how could a digital identity of a company be embodied in a building ?
but we ’ re nowhere near the endgame when it comes to our perception .
you don &apos;t understand laughter fully by the time your brain has matured at the end of your teens .
a commitment device is a decision that you make with a cool head to bind yourself so that you don &apos;t do something regrettable when you have a hot head .
they &apos;re open because they ask the audience to be a player , a protagonist , a partner , rather than a passive spectator , and they &apos;re open because they know that imagination cannot be contained in buildings , and so much of the work they do is site-specific or outdoor work .
well , that doesn &apos;t really cut it anymore .
here in the united states , i think you see it in this election campaign : a longing for change .
and , long story short , again , they &apos;ve been so successful .
in particular , &quot; &quot; the supper at emmaus &quot; &quot; which was viewed as vermeer &apos;s finest masterpiece , his best work — people would come &#91; from &#93; all over the world to see it — was actually a forgery .
our ability to imagine makes us inventors and creators and unique .
and we have a little storage room where we converted a jail .
but saving is exactly the wrong thing to do from the system point of view .
second , in play , he &apos;s a national champion bridge player .
so the whole point of that is not , sort of , to make , like , a circus thing of showing exceptional beings who can jump , or whatever .
they most likely did the same as mr. domingos : &quot; &quot; ah ! what &apos;s this ? i &apos;m not understanding , it &apos;s going to the garbage &quot; &quot; .
and this is the pump .
he was back in luton , he was now 82 , and i hadn &apos;t seen him for 30-odd years , and when he opened the door , i saw this tiny little man with lambent , smiling eyes , and he was smiling , and i &apos;d never seen him smile .
warm-blooded animals take a huge hit at this time .
but when we think about the kind of possibilities i paint , we should feel a bit of fear .
i think it &apos;s excessive internet use in general , excessive video gaming , excessive new access to pornography .
the beauty of this is that once you plant a few dead bodies in that land , it can &apos;t be touched , it can &apos;t be developed on — hence the term , &quot; &quot; conservation burial . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s the equivalent of chaining yourself to a tree post-mortem — &quot; &quot; hell no , i won &apos;t go !
it &apos;s used for public health awareness campaigns such as the prevention of cholera .
ok , you can do that ? yeah ? ok .
it was also an expensive fight .
you don &apos;t need to believe me . you shouldn &apos;t believe me .
and because these are artists , they have very artistic temperaments .
and they did start to evolve .
now the americans in the audience will know all about cup stacking .
now let &apos;s take a look at hiv .
he will urinate and spin his tail to spread the urine around and make him more attractive .
and of course , it wasn &apos;t actually a working mine anymore , because , though ray was a miner there , the mine had closed and had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction , because , of course , it can &apos;t compete on the scale of operations which are happening in south america , australia , wherever .
the protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women like rose mapendo .
( applause )
you see all of these nuances .
now , it &apos;s clear that our investment in breast cancer has produced results .
it took 23 hours . i did it with my neurosurgeon .
needless to list them here , and there are more competent people to talk about this .
the amount of a moderate-to-severe snow melting of an area equivalent to the size of california .
those who were still around in school , besides the people who had dropped out .
you can imagine , the musicians were disconsolate .
thank you all very much .
and all over india , at the end of about two years , children were beginning to google their homework .
could we reinvent fire ?
but we observed that there are no cells entering the brains of these animals .
they dance , they act — and the more they do , they are praised .
and that was one of the reasons why the web wasn &apos;t quite as emergent as it could be because you needed two-way linking , you needed that kind of feedback mechanism to be able to really do interesting things .
when those mujahideen defeated the soviet union , we disengaged .
this is just an example of one of these computable documents .
and the answer is , every single swedish business leader does that every single day .
yeah . i thought so . not surprised .
so , why would you want to replicate bit strings ?
we look at the savings rate and it has been declining since the 1950s .
they &apos;re actually identical , so it &apos;s quite cost-effective .
we turned the building into what we called now the archive house .
so , when we look back and step out at this and see the beginning of these trends that we &apos;re seeing in our data , we see a very hopeful picture for the future of america .
when something becomes ultra-low cost , it becomes massively scalable .
our kids &apos; teachers seem to be failing them .
or if we analyzed our data by sex .
so it &apos;s something we need to focus on .
they can produce loud clicks and listen for echoes from the sea floor in order to orient .
we actually saw seals out of our car window , and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them and then blocked them with our giant heads .
( laughter ) piles of dirty socks on the floor , more boring sports shows than i ever thought possible — ( laughter ) and fights that bring me to tears when it feels like we &apos;re not speaking the same language .
but what &apos;s really important here is , look at all those dots .
iw : but last year , we did exactly that .
when she spoke to the three friends and the stranger , they had not had a nice time — it &apos;s actually rather difficult , it &apos;s rather awkward ...
they were things like , what are the capitals of the 44 or 45 states that existed at that time ?
but we try to stand on our feet , to do something , little things , we can for our people .
this guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named ami tabar .
i &apos;m just showing the new york times website here .
but today , i &apos;m going to use a different approach , one that is inspired by these two initiatives here , a harmonic one and a philosophical one .
one of my favorites has always been : &quot; make love to your man in a chevy van , &quot; because that was my vehicle when i was in college .
this is worthy of sachin tendulkar .
and as an activist , that was not good enough .
so these action neighborhoods , as i call them , really become the inspiration to imagine other interpretations of citizenship that have less to do , in fact , with belonging to the nation-state , and more with upholding the notion of citizenship as a creative act that reorganizes institutional protocols in the spaces of the city .
the other third didn &apos;t lie , or perhaps forgot , or you &apos;re lying to me about your lying , which is very , very devious . ( laughter ) this fits with a lot of the research , which suggests that lying is very pervasive .
so then we said , how many people were executed on march 29 , 1984 ?
( laughter ) and i heard that , and that was all i needed .
and now let &apos;s compare that with fish farming .
the fact : population growth in countries with high laptop — ( laughter ) i need hans rosling to give me a graph .
ca : that scale delivers efficiency .
i think if marianne and the members of her women &apos;s group can talk about this openly and have this discussion out amongst themselves and in public , we can , too .
as you can see on this map , russia is still the largest country in the world .
management reports are full of complaints about the lack of clarity .
in too many 401 ( k ) plans , if people do nothing , it means they &apos;re not saving for retirement , if they don &apos;t check the box .
you will feel loved and appreciated like never before and reconnect with friends and acquaintances you haven &apos;t heard from in years .
and we did . we got better material .
what am i ?
be sure to enjoy windows for radio at home and at work .
and that gets me to one of the biggest deals about 3d printing .
but there &apos;s also the fact that law is another place where there are many opinions in circulation , but they need to be resolved to one canonical copy , and when you go onto github , and you look around , there are millions and millions of projects , almost all of which are source code , but if you look around the edges , you can see people experimenting with the political ramifications of a system like that .
they say you never forget the names of those who die .
but once they find it , that dna is still tiny , and surrounded by so much other dna , that what these machines then do is copy the target gene , and one copy piles on top of another , millions and millions and millions of copies , until that gene stands out against the rest ; until we can visualize it , interpret it , read it , understand it , until we can answer : does my pig have the flu ?
this high level group agreed to honestly discuss the merits and flaws of drug policies .
well , fascinatingly , it turns out that if you give children antibiotics in the first six months of life , they &apos;re more likely to become obese later on than if they don &apos;t get antibiotics then or only get them later , and so what we do early on may have profound impacts on the gut microbial community and on later health that we &apos;re only beginning to understand .
so we know there &apos;s at least one planet , our own earth , in which there is life .
the patterns that you see are there at all of the different scales , but you can &apos;t chop it into one little bit and say , &quot; oh , well let me just make a smaller climate . &quot;
sally &apos;s giving her opinion to them , and they &apos;re giving their opinion to sally .

it &apos;s an incredible means of coordinating , in a very fine-grained way , information flows .
but nonetheless , he is the cutting edge of our experimentation with doing good with very few resources being brought to bear in , again , the world &apos;s worst places .
we could spend hours going over this .
when you look at when anti-muslim sentiment spiked between 2001 and 2013 , it happened three times , but it wasn &apos;t around terrorist attacks .

the &quot; &quot; jk wedding &#91; entrance &#93; dance &quot; &quot; became so popular that nbc parodied it on the season finale of &quot; &quot; the office , &quot; &quot; which just goes to show , it &apos;s truly an ecosystem of culture .
so this pedestrian here might be stepping into the road , might not be .
gorgonian fans oscillate with the waves .
and then someone else has something the complete opposite of yours .
that means improvise .
it may seem strange that i have suppressed the truth and hidden this for so long .
and they work . people use them . people are okay .

doctors thought it was a new form of polio .
and to get there , we need to do the assessment .
so the solar cell , for a moment , is harvesting energy from this artificial light source .
this wasn &apos;t supposed to happen .
we try to produce a robot that will eat the algae , consume it and make it safe .
if it stops working for some reason , i can retrain it .
i will come to my last example and then quit .
so , first of all , this would be horrific beyond anything we can possibly imagine .
it &apos;s the place where you &apos;re deciding right now you probably aren &apos;t going to order the steak for dinner .
in many digital health discussions , people believe in and embrace the idea that we can simply digitize the data , wirelessly transmit it , send it to the cloud , and in the cloud , we can extract meaningful information for interpretation .
but 60 years after &quot; &quot; the feminine mystique &quot; &quot; was published , many women actually have more choices than men do .
children live on things . they live under things .
and rightly so , in many cases .
and many countries are going to go brickless from the start because they &apos;re never going to be able to afford the mega-medicalplexes that a lot of the rest of the world has built .
it was the size of a postage stamp and just as thin , and was a thin covering around their walnut-sized brain , but it was capable of a new type of thinking .
if you look at my calendar , you will see every working day one and a half hours from 7pm to 8 : 30pm uae time blocked and called &quot; &quot; family time . &quot; &quot; this is sacred time .
and they &apos;re going to break ground in may .
haiti was something we hadn &apos;t seen before .
and in an age of distraction , nothing is so luxurious as paying attention .
we are going to manage that internet .
i mean , it &apos;s a nightmare .
in many african countries the modern sector is lost .
but it could spread everywhere .
we ought to be able to notice that .
so this is attempting to make potato starch plastic .
what &apos;s the difference ?
so , this theory is that the brain creates , builds , a version of the universe , and projects this version of the universe , like a bubble , all around us .
it &apos;s just a lesion formed inside .
because i had someone dear to me snatched away .
and a lot of ideas were tested and tried on him , but the one that finally worked was this one . let &apos;s take a look .
and if you can , just scribble a pattern .
from 1980 . &quot; &quot; dear mr. mankoff , confirming the agreement there of — &quot; &quot; blah blah blah blah — blur — &quot; for any idea drawings . &quot;
well i think you probably already have the picture .
they thought it would reduce their property values .
&quot; after you . &quot; &quot; oh , no , no . after you . &quot;

i can get very excited by saying something really quickly , or i can slow right down to emphasize , and at the end of that , of course , is our old friend silence .
suddenly , we humans — a recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature — have grown in population , technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power .
by the same token , entropica is broadly applicable to problems in autonomous defense , logistics and transportation .
i do so through many ways .
the question is , are we going to test those intuitions ?
so there &apos;s multiple databases .
( laughter ) so , i blew it up and ran into the living room , my finger where it shouldn &apos;t have been , i was waving this buzzing sheep around , and my mother looked like she was going to die of shock . ( laughter )
it certainly impacted the way we think about ted &apos;s future , and perhaps the world &apos;s future overall .
&quot; &quot; two sticks , &quot; &quot; you can go with it . thanks .
i began craving wild , open spaces , and so i set out to find the places others had written off as too cold , too remote , and too dangerous to surf , and that challenge intrigued me .
today , when we hear the threats of war and the high rhetoric , we &apos;re oftentimes led to believe that this is yet another one of those unsolvable middle eastern conflicts with roots as old as the region itself .

miami was down by three , there was 20 seconds left .
this is what i understand from my faith tradition , and this is what i understand from my studies of other faith traditions , and this is the common platform on which we must all stand , and when we stand on this platform as such , i am convinced that we can make a wonderful world .
cell phones are thrown away by the hundreds of millions every year , hundreds of millions in the u.s. alone , not counting the rest of the world , which of course we should do , but in fact , cell phones are great .
this may be surprising .
it has shrunk because our instruments enable us in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time , and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding of the material world , and this granular understanding has generated reams of data that our brains can no longer comprehend and for which we need more and more complicated computers .
so they all have his number .
so this is great . this is the digital meeting the physical .
( laughter ) it &apos;s a great way to start sentences .
and as she was talking , a thought came to my mind .
we have skin enhancements , clothing .
there are 12 stadia probably to come , but there are 32 training pitches where all the individual countries are going to train .
do you hate americans ?
on it , everyone you love , everyone you know , everyone you &apos;ve ever heard of , every human being who ever was lived out their lives .
&quot; &quot; housework makes her horny .
so if i can finish with a metaphor for intervention , what we need to think of is something like mountain rescue .
i had teamed up with john and was working hard , hoping he would notice how great i was and that he would come to support my case to make partner at the firm .
if you are fighting in a non-governmental organization , you love equity between gender .

and it &apos;s got the black-and-white curbs that we saw in the video , and as we click through it , you can see someone &apos;s uploaded photos to go with the map , which is very handy , so we click into the photos . and the photos start showing us more detail that we can cross-reference with the video .
you all remember , dolly , it came from a single mammary cell .
and small groups are more prone to accidents and bad luck .
it paralyzes you . it starts by killing the motor neurons in your spinal cord .
i mean , there are so many possibilities for why tumors don &apos;t go to skeletal muscle .

it has been made , already , on remote controlled little airplane models , without pilots .
and in 1860 , this group of people came together , and they all speculated about what would happen to the city of new york in 100 years , and the conclusion was unanimous : the city of new york would not exist in 100 years .
so i downloaded the sheet music and started playing .
it &apos;s a parabolic scheffler solar cooker .
five hundred dollars ?
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the opossums .
so i got a lot of reader feedback on that one .
when you think about stuff that people have built that &apos;s popular — jh : cbgb &apos;s has to close eventually , you know . that &apos;s the rule .
so we can &apos;t be satisfied , not even close to satisfied .
we investigate materials and technologies that have unexpected properties . over the last three years , we found over 200 of these things , and so we looked back into our library and selected six we thought would be most surprising for ted .
now , back in the &apos; 80s , there were no software patents , and it was xerox that pioneered the graphical user interface .

i mean , a really small trailer park .
thank you .
i &apos;m going to give you a little math problem , and i want you to just yell out the answer as fast as possible .
october 9th , in france , jean-pierre luminet said that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron , based on information that they got from this probe .
because year after year , i was one of fewer and fewer , and now , often the only woman in a room .
but some species that we killed off totally we could consider bringing back to a world that misses them .
the people on the top row are the provenly reliable ones .
now in some cases math can even help explain , or propose explanations for , historical forces .
we are grateful , but we know that we can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform .
what did it were higher taxes and time and place restrictions on sale and use and effective anti-smoking campaigns .
it &apos;s the place where we can see and touch and hear and feel climate change in action .
i &apos;m , among several other things , an electrical engineer , and that means that i spend a good amount of time designing and building new pieces of technology , and more specifically designing and building electronics .
now , if i make a string of these , a bit string , they will be able to replicate .
we gave them instructions on how to create origami , and we gave them a sheet of paper .
and that is not a bad thing , in itself .
and that &apos;s true both for continental areas like the u.s. or europe and for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid .
and it reminded me of that old joke where the bank robber comes out of the courthouse handcuffed , and the reporter yells , &quot; &quot; hey , willy . why do you rob banks ? &quot; &quot; and he says , &quot; &quot; cause that &apos;s where all the money is . &quot; &quot; and i would tell people , &quot; &quot; why do i go to kiribati ?
and so when the rest of the team advanced they found little left . and that night the unit &apos;s commander did a sad duty , and he wrote a condolence letter back to the united states , and he talked about how hard the loss had been on his unit , about the fact that they had lost their bravest soldier , a soldier who had saved their lives many a time .
a person with normal hearing would have the visual perspective of this .
many whitopians feel pushed by illegals , social welfare abuse , minorities , density , crowded schools .
( laughter ) like the things that people use .

virtue is an old-fashioned word .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily feed back on itself the way we did things .

the coal revolution fueled the industrial revolution , and , even in the 1900s , we &apos;ve seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , air-conditioning ; we can make modern materials and do so many things .
and a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial or institutional difficulties in arranging group output .
there &apos;s tuareg shoes from north africa . there &apos;s a kifwebe mask .
i mean , if i didn &apos;t discover a particle — and i didn &apos;t — if i didn &apos;t discover a particle , why am i here talking to you ?
last year , with the help of the bill and melinda gates foundation , three and a half million farmers grew sub1 rice .

in the center , we have a porous , flexible membrane on which we can add human cells from , say , our lungs , and then underneath , they had capillary cells , the cells in our blood vessels .

they began to shut down the media that the protests were happening on .
what turns me on about the digital age , what excites me personally , is that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing .

that guy could teach it .
we built it at my home , which means that i got a little extra help from my three-year-old son ramon .
they &apos;re not just going to be smart .

and i &apos;m not going to give you the patois translation ; i &apos;m going to make it standard english .
a lot of my soldiers signed up for completely different reasons .
but , understand this is my intellectual viagra .
so let &apos;s think of another example : working with children in care .
now , to make this more concrete , let &apos;s look at the list of top 10 words that statistically stick out in the most favorite tedtalks and in the least favorite tedtalks .
i would argue that they have kind of a narrow conception of national security .
back inside , i asked my classmates if they were having the same experience of words jumping around our cases as i was .
the money goes from the company into the village via tree-planting .
do they do that for the children ? &quot; &quot; he looked at me like i had just quoted a whitney houston song .
so we played ze frank at chess collaboratively , and we beat him .
that &apos;s another crevasse .
which means that they have more proven the limits of renewable energies than the potential of it .
and that was really cool .
the cool thing is , what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re changing the mind of milo constantly .
and they developed this new technique , called shape deposition manufacturing .

and we &apos;re seeing from all points on the globe similar stories .
what you saw after katrina is a very good indicator of how little prepared the united states is for any kind of major attack .
i was burned very badly .
during the twentieth century , we witnessed the atrocities of stalin , hitler , mao , pol pot , rwanda and other genocides , and even though the twenty-first century is only seven years old , we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in darfur and the daily horrors of iraq .

but it &apos;s useful for everybody to learn how to read and write .

it &apos;s now traveling .
so we &apos;ve offered unlimited storage , unlimited bandwidth , forever , for free , to anybody that has something to share that belongs in a library .
and that makes it really difficult — in fact , in practical purposes , impossible — to make an image of something you really care about .
and in this age , where everything seems mapped , measured and studied , in this age of information , i remind you all that discoveries are not just made in the black void of the unknown but in the white noise of overwhelming data .
so to sum it up , we need trust to play , and we need trust to be creative . so , there ’ s a connection .

okay , let &apos;s go back to the slides .
the president of the maldives conducted a mock cabinet meeting underwater recently to highlight the dire straits of these countries .
( applause )
he knows we did not know . we did not know !

and if we do enough of these kinds of things , the awareness is going to sink in that things are going to be different .

and that some of the channels we thought would work didn &apos;t work .
this is a natural part of the process as the family comes to terms with the transition in their relationship to the deceased , and this is the transition from relating to the deceased as a person who &apos;s living to relating to the deceased as a person who &apos;s an ancestor .

take a beer mat and rotate it by a quarter of a turn , then flip it . and then do it in the other order , and the picture will be facing in the opposite direction .
( applause )
and this is the learning process .
we &apos;d say it like this : one : how do we find people ?
if you go on google and you look for &quot; &quot; innovation + creativity , &quot; &quot; you get 30 million hits . if you add the word &quot; &quot; consultants , &quot; &quot; it doubles to 60 million . ( laughter ) are you with me ? and yet , statistically , what you discover is that about one in 100,000 ideas is found making money or delivering benefits two years after its inception .
now let &apos;s take this back into my world of medicine where i &apos;m a lot more comfortable , or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what i &apos;m going to talk to you about .
and you know , outcasting the family is the biggest social punishment one can think of .
before , they were closed off .
and the plastics , we get from oil , which we go to more remote locations and drill ever deeper wells to extract .

even with this announcement , as we did in 2003 — that work was funded by the department of energy , so the work was reviewed at the level of the white house , trying to decide whether to classify the work or publish it .
when you come back out , you get to drop your vote into the ballot box where it mixes with all the other votes , so that no one knows how you voted .
so before i talk about what is , i think , the critical difference between lolcats and ushahidi , i want to talk about their shared source .
too many lives are at stake .
but this picture is very deceiving .
have you ever found yourself at a restaurant spacing out just doing this over and over ?
the mall is the greatest civic stage in this country for dissent .
most of them are young , black boys dying by guns .
so instead , we rely on technology and data .

what does it mean ?
i need help , and i can &apos;t help diana . &quot; &quot; so that was at eight o &apos;clock at night .

back in the 1970s , our fourth king famously pronounced that for bhutan , gross national happiness is more important than gross national product .

and as we assemble these tools , from a design point of view , i get terribly excited about it , because these are things , as we &apos;ve already said , they &apos;re arriving at the brain , it would seem , before cognition , before we can manipulate them — electrochemical party tricks .
according to the new york times in 1904 , there was an outbreak of chinese restaurants all over town , and &quot; &quot; ... the city has gone &apos; chop suey &apos; mad . &quot; &quot; so it took about 30 years before the americans realized that chop suey is actually not known in china , and as this article points out , &quot; the average native of any city in china knows nothing of chop suey . &quot;
three key imperatives were really important to our work .
fifty communicable diseases like to travel in human shit .

so the idea was to take these 66,000 seeds that they agreed to give us , and to take each seed and trap it in this precious optical hair and grow that through this box , very simple box element , and make it a building that could move in the wind .
so why is that ?
we &apos;re mammals . we produce a lot of smell .
if you had caught me straight out of college in the halls of the vermont state house where i was a lobbyist in training and asked me what i was going to do with my life , i would have told you that i &apos;d just passed the hanyu shuiping kaoshi , the chinese equivalency exam , and i was going to go study law in beijing , and i was going to improve u.s.-china relations through top-down policy changes and judicial system reforms .

you see , most cameras record images one row at a time , and so if an object moves during the recording of a single image , there &apos;s a slight time delay between each row , and this causes slight artifacts that get coded into each frame of a video .
my dad &apos;s not alone . there &apos;s about 35 million people globally living with some kind of dementia , and by 2030 they &apos;re expecting that to double to 70 million .
but i couldn &apos;t take a submarine ride — especially between the time i knew i was coming here and today — so i had to do a little experiment myself to see if there was oil in the gulf of mexico .
well , tonight he sleeps safely with a stack of letters just like this one tucked beneath his pillow , scripted by strangers who were there for him when .
and the obvious thing that &apos;s changing is its size .
the solution , i think , is that we use language at two levels : the literal form signals the safest relationship with the listener , whereas the implicated content — the reading between the lines that we count on the listener to perform — allows the listener to derive the interpretation which is most relevant in context , which possibly initiates a changed relationship .
