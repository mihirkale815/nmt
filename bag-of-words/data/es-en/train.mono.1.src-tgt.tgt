I graduated from university to become a theater director , and that progress is entirely to do with the fact that people I &apos;ll never meet fought for women to have rights , get the vote , get education , have progress .

The question of whether disgust ought to influence our moral and political judgments certainly has to be complex , and might depend on exactly what judgments we &apos;re talking about , and as a scientist , we have to conclude sometimes that the scientific method is just ill-equipped to answer these sorts of questions .

So who would think that it was low-fat ?
Even in the midst of terrible destruction and death and chaos , I learned how ordinary people could help their neighbors , share food , raise their children , drag someone who &apos;s being sniped at from the middle of the road even though you yourself were endangering your life , helping people get into taxis who were injured to try to take them to hospitals .
And this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences .
If you did , could you please raise your hand ?
I set out to write a compelling economic story , one that had great characters , that no one else was telling , and one that I thought mattered .

When we think about how we address problems in this country , we often start from a place of trickle-down justice .
Arabs were saving Jews . Jews were saving Arabs .
That &apos;s always been the harder problem when it comes to fighting wars .

If we didn &apos;t have this present moment , we wouldn &apos;t have any opportunity to do anything or experience anything , and this moment is a gift .
So , all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them , and I think as designers we need to really think about how we can create a different relationship between our work and the world , whether it &apos;s for business , or , as I &apos;m going to show , on some civic-type projects .

They truly perform as they transform through time and as communities negotiate the spaces and boundaries and resources .
This satellite covers the whole of Africa and goes back as far as 1984 , and that &apos;s important , because if you know how many times a place has had a drought in the last 30 years , you can make a pretty good estimate what the chances are of drought in the future , and that means that you can put a price tag on the risk of drought .
We put waste water and some source of CO2 into our floating structure , and the waste water provides nutrients for the algae to grow , and they sequester CO2 that would otherwise go off into the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas .

Now imaginative people have been having fun with this for over 400 years .
I use planet Earth to go in very extreme environments where conditions were similar to those of Mars at the time when the climate changed , and there I &apos;m trying to understand what happened .
It &apos;s pressure from the human population hunting and destroying their habitats which has done so .
But as the social researcher Charles Murray has documented , as we started to automate the economy , and 1960 is just about when computers started to be used by businesses , as we started to progressively inject technology and automation and digital stuff into the economy , the fortunes of Bill and Ted diverged a lot .

Second question : what causes these changes ?
We &apos;ve watched the financial markets that we uniquely create — these markets that were supposed to be foolproof — we &apos;ve watched them kind of collapse before our eyes .

A momentous thing that can happen to a culture is they can acquire a new style of arguing : trial by jury , voting , peer review , now this . Right ?
Its closest relative is , in fact , from mice , and so we would call this a xenotropic retrovirus , because it &apos;s infecting a species other than mice .
And in the life that everyone sees , who I am is a friend , a son , a brother , a stand-up comedian and a teenager .

Now we have taken on a second thing , and this gets to my wish .
It is February and not lying is impossible . &quot; &quot; And I really spend a lot of time wondering , how much truth do we tell ?
( Laughter ) But that &apos;s the work I &apos;m doing with BioSentient Corporation trying to figure out how do we integrate these things ?
There &apos;s no dynamic , there &apos;s no highs or lows , if everything is awesome .
This is just the grassroots stuff again , OK ?
This is a pretty involved process ; it took us about four and a half years .
And all of you need to have it embedded in your brains and to organize yourselves around it .
He took owl monkeys , wired them up so that a computer watched their brains while they moved , especially looking at the movement of their right arm .
His current obsession is to leave Lebanon at any cost — even if it meant embarking on a hazardous journey along with refugees drifting towards Europe today through the Mediterranean .
I am a nomadic artist .
Rather than just cutting costs , you need to think about initiatives that will enable you to win in the medium term , initiatives to drive growth , actions that will fundamentally change the way the company operates , and very importantly , investments to develop the leadership and the talent .

And so sometimes these analogous experiences , analogous role-play , can also be quite valuable .
Just in the past couple years , we &apos;ve seen digital tools display skills and abilities that they never , ever had before , and that kind of eat deeply into what we human beings do for a living .

The results of this kind of work are simple and they &apos;re powerful .
It &apos;s so amazing , it &apos;s so exciting .
And they grow and grow by stages . And they climb out of the water , burst out , as the adult which we see .
And so they did something that &apos;s really radical , when you think about how government is used to working .
Governments get elected , and then they fall below 50 percent approval in a few months and stay there and get worse until the next election .
So our children are getting larger , but at the same time we are growing into different directions .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s in all seven continents , including Antarctica .
In Britain , it could mean looking to the French , learning from the French , getting directly elected mayors in place in a French commune system .
Metal peppered his face .
But what I &apos;d like to talk about today is the fact that this morning , about a billion people on Earth — or one out of every seven — woke up and didn &apos;t even know how to fill this cup .
One billion grains of sand come into existence in the world each second .
So as an academic , we &apos;re always trained to be able to jump through hoops to raise funding for our labs , and we get our robots to do that .
We &apos;ve seen what happens when we divide an already small planet into smaller islands .
I think that Torajans socially recognize and culturally express what many of us feel to be true despite the widespread acceptance of the biomedical definition of death , and that is that our relationships with other humans , their impact on our social reality , doesn &apos;t cease with the termination of the physical processes of the body , that there &apos;s a period of transition as the relationship between the living and the dead is transformed but not ended .
In this talk today , I want to present a different idea for why investing in early childhood education makes sense as a public investment .
There &apos;s a lot of information here .
So I started doubting myself and wondering what was the real purpose of this whole project ?
It was in far western New South Wales .
And we don &apos;t even know the shape of the language .
It should be thought of as a biological moonshot with a timetable .
( Laughter ) Of course it &apos;s meant to be funny , but in all seriousness , suicidal ideation is quite common with traumatic brain injuries .

So suppose your goal is to get kids into school .
So we can now , in a matter of hours , determine a whole human genome .
But frankly there are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from NYU , have them go study for a semester at the University of Arkansas , and vice versa . Do it at the high school level .
Why ? Why do we have to be left out ?
That &apos;s what your genes are doing every day .
You can imagine what it was like in the winter at 10,000 feet .

I mean , it &apos;s the same story . It &apos;s just different names .
In my experience , in fact , the light footprint was extremely helpful .
Now , in a word , the answer is &quot; &quot; rules . &quot; &quot; Bad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that &apos;s available when people can bring new technologies in and make them available to someone like Nelson .
Animals are not just raw materials .
All right .
And the Hell Creek Project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find , and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them .
So today what you have is what I call the middle 40 percent , the people who are not in the top 10 and who are not in the bottom 50 , and what you can view as the wealth middle class that owns 20 to 30 percent of total wealth , national wealth , whereas they used to be poor , a century ago , when there was basically no wealth middle class .
If you look at the scene , Egypt , for 30 years , had been in a downhill — going into a downhill .
And let me give you a few illustrations .
And so I can generate a force feedback .
And there &apos;s five or six different compilations there , But each one of those compilations reflects input from hundreds of these kinds of records from corals .
But I do think it &apos;s an important conversation .
So it blinks one second after you do .
If you look up high enough , you could see me .
( Laughter ) Which isn &apos;t a great idea .
And this brings us to our third part of the exercise , which is to draw how to make toast , but this time in a group .
In fact , in Go , there are more possible moves than there are atoms in the universe .
We &apos;ve shared transportation .
And then 10 years from now , billions will again have gone into Africa , and we would still have the same problems .
And we might be able to find evidence of our own origin in the most unlikely place , and this place in Mars .
Instead of thinking about what to build , building in order to think .
So I hope there aren &apos;t too many psychologists in this audience .
But online , everybody speaks at the same speed .
We surround ourselves with people who feel the same way we do , and we approve each other , and that &apos;s a really good feeling .
Number two : free trade .
We also studied Vineet Nayar at HCL Technologies , an Indian outsourcing company .

Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert , and this happens only when we create too much bare ground .
After the final &quot; &quot; no &quot; &quot; comes a &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; When any great moral challenge is ultimately resolved into a binary choice between what is right and what is wrong , the outcome is fore-ordained because of who we are as human beings .

This is Gen9 gene assembler , and so right now when you try to print a gene , what you do is somebody in a factory with pipettes puts the thing together by hand , you have one error per 100 base pairs , and it takes a long time and costs a lot of money .
And so while other kids were BBM-ing their parents , I was literally waiting by the mailbox to get a letter from home to see how the weekend had gone , which was a little frustrating when Grandma was in the hospital , but I was just looking for some sort of scribble , some unkempt cursive from my mother .

So it &apos;s the same way , like those action video games have a number of ingredients that are actually really powerful for brain plasticity , learning , attention , vision , etc . , and so we need and we &apos;re working on understanding what are those active ingredients so that we can really then leverage them to deliver better games , either for education or for rehabilitation of patients .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Go read it . &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Oh , that one wasn &apos;t so awesome . &quot; &quot; And then we went to another one — it didn &apos;t have great visuals , but it had great information — and spent an hour talking about the learning process , because it wasn &apos;t about whether or not it was perfect , or whether or not it was what I could create .
And then at my worst moments : Why did I make such a stupid mistake ?

And Richard Meier , who was one of my teachers , kept coming over to my desk to give me criticism , and he would say , &quot; &quot; Bill , you &apos;ve got to understand- — solar energy has nothing to do with architecture . &quot; &quot; I guess he didn &apos;t read Vitruvius .
You can find it on the East Coast as well as the West Coast , and often the symbols are very well preserved , so each of these symbols has four bits — it &apos;s a four-bit binary word — you draw these lines in the sand randomly , and then you count off , and if it &apos;s an odd number , you put down one stroke , and if it &apos;s an even number , you put down two strokes .
If our airplane is too heavy , if the pilot wastes energy , we &apos;ll never make it through the night .

In fact , everybody in this room probably , especially if you picked up your bag — some of you , I know , didn &apos;t pick up your bags — but if you picked up your bag , everybody in this room has got in their pocket , or back in their room , something that 350 years ago , kings would have gone to war to have .
And this is a place where people not only reach age 100 , they do so with extraordinary vigor .
DH : Now obviously , this is not something we do on our regular show ; it &apos;s something we just kind of learned for this , so we &apos;re going to try . But can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs ?
It reminded me a lot of the talk we heard this morning , about this operating room machinery that was designed specifically for Africa .

RL : So there are , when our legitimate foreign intelligence targets of the type that I described before , use the global telecommunications system as their communications methodology , and they do , because it &apos;s a great system , it &apos;s the most complex system ever devised by man , and it is a wonder , and lots of folks in the room there are responsible for the creation and enhancement of that , and it &apos;s just a wonderful thing .
So it turns out that being paid less and praised less has its upsides — for society at least .
In about four months of release , we &apos;ve brought that population of mosquitos — in most cases we &apos;re dealing with villages here of about 2,000 , 3,000 people , that sort of size , starting small — we &apos;ve taken that mosquito population down by about 85 percent in about four months .

That &apos;s an inconvenience compared to having both of them gone . &quot; &quot; I got a day job , and my nights and weekends are already filled up with things like , let &apos;s supply water to the world , and power to the world , and educate all the kids , which , Chris , I will not talk about .

I &apos;m taking data from the U.N. — it &apos;s the same as the World Bank has — on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies .
The logarithmic scale hides the scale of the increase , because this represents trillions-fold increase since the 1890 census .

This ain &apos;t going to be my last movie .
We are talking here about , oftentimes , very young individuals with spinal cord injuries , that in the prime of their life — 20s , 30s , 40s — hit a wall and the wheelchair &apos;s the only option .

Ten years ago , however , the promise of democracy seemed to be extraordinary . George W. Bush stood up in his State of the Union address in 2003 and said that democracy was the force that would beat most of the ills of the world .

All other species on this planet are gene machines only , they don &apos;t imitate at all well , hardly at all .
And I said , first of all , let me do the calculation on that compound , bottom right , which is related to coumarin , but has an extra pentagon inserted into the molecule .

And this is the same thing you see when people compress video to send : they want to make it very sparse , because that file is smaller . And this is what the retina is doing , and it &apos;s doing it just with the circuitry , and how this network of neurons that are interacting in there , which we &apos;ve captured on the chip .
What is this about ?
But dragonflies — a bit tricky .
Over the Spanish Steps we go .
I find this a particularly apt description of science and how science works — bumbling around in a dark room , bumping into things , trying to figure out what shape this might be , what that might be , there are reports of a cat somewhere around , they may not be reliable , they may be , and so forth and so on .
Coke &apos;s been in Africa since 1928 , but most of the time they couldn &apos;t reach the distant markets , because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world , which was a large truck rolling down the street .

So what we found is that the bursts last long enough in order to support wave resonances , which are things caused by exchanges of energy between particles that may have been excited , that depend on the volume .
Every time we lead one of these efforts we have to whip ourselves into this imminent threat thing .
And the women decided that they would train not the next generation of girls , because they had grown too old already , but the next generation .

I mean , it &apos;s a hobby of mine that I &apos;ve been indulging in for the last few years , and it all started out with this picture of the American artist , Donald Baechler I had hanging at home . I had to look at it every day and after a while I just couldn &apos;t stand the mess anymore this guy was looking at all day long .

So , looking for answers , I went to Catholic mass .
Okay . So I &apos;m smiling .
And it has this constant voiceover narrative in your stream of conscious thinking .
Remember that we scanned both brains at the same time , so we can ask about time-synced activity in similar or different areas simultaneously , just like if you wanted to study a conversation and you were scanning two people talking to each other and you &apos;d expect common activity in language regions when they &apos;re actually kind of listening and communicating .
( Applause )
And that would be very interesting in the developing world .
We C.T.-scanned all of our bones and built a digital Spinosaurus skeleton .

And doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients , but now this will change .
Is there a way we can show people food in a way they have not seen it before ?

( Applause )
That &apos;s the twelfth one .
And this is continuing and continuing and continuing .
And four , a global recession that has fundamentally shocked consumer behaviors .
If we do not lift up the women who played critical roles in these struggles , we fail to offer up role models to future generations .

But there &apos;s an important thing to remember here : even though companies pushed back , even though companies demanded , hey , let &apos;s do this through a warrant process , let &apos;s do this where we actually have some sort of legal review , some sort of basis for handing over these users &apos; data , we saw stories in the Washington Post last year that weren &apos;t as well reported as the PRISM story that said the NSA broke in to the data center communications between Google to itself and Yahoo to itself .
( Laughter ) But actually , the most impressive thing to me is that — well , actually , I would also like to say this for all children is to say thank you to all adults , for actually caring for us a lot , and to make our future world much better .
So , where do we go from here ?
So one has got to discover a certain wholeness .

And we &apos;ve already started construction on section two .
But dragonflies are not the only creatures that make the crossing .

And when someone wants to rent a room , they go onto the blockchain database and all the criteria , they sift through , it helps them find the right room , and then the blockchain helps with the contracting , it identifies the party , it handles the payments just through digital payments — they &apos;re built into the system .

And I &apos;m a very nerdy doctor , so I read all of the studies that I could on this drug . I read the one study that was published that showed that reboxetine was better than placebo , and I read the other three studies that were published that showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other antidepressant , and because this patient hadn &apos;t done well on those other antidepressants , I thought , well , reboxetine is just as good . It &apos;s one to try .
Why is it a disease of the aged ?
Let &apos;s look at a couple of quick examples .

And if our sun has planets — Mercury , Venus , Earth , Mars , etc . , surely those other stars should have planets also , and they do .
I figure about half of that are men , so that takes the number down to 750,000 .
But we do provide on that website a standardized list of definitions , because it &apos;s hard to attack a behavior in the right way if we &apos;re not all sharing a definition of what that behavior is .
&quot; That &apos;s right , &quot; it said , &quot; I am YouTube . &quot;
And the Marrow Miner , the way it works is shown here .
He &apos;s still waiting for his funeral in Norway , and none of his family will be able to attend .
One of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet .
So get peacekeepers there , but get them home as soon as possible .
And the collective has enabled me to form collaborations with a whole array of interesting people .
So I made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life , and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse — the subject of martyrdom , the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection of love of God , faith , but violence and crime and cruelty .
Impressive . Thank you .

Pew Research polls Chinese public attitudes , and here are the numbers in recent years .

And a small group of thoughtful people changed that bay .
We are going to need a new generation of citizen leaders willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning as rapidly as possible .

And it just disturbed me so much .
You see these cars that drive up — usually it &apos;s Saabs and Audis and Volvos , because in certain neighborhoods it &apos;s socially acceptable to have a luxury car , so long as it comes from a country hostile to U.S. foreign policy — that &apos;s fine .
So I started thinking about peace , and I was obviously , as I said to you , very much moved by these images , trying to make sense of that .
And I feel that we have a special connection , which I value very much .
They seem cleverer .
I spent ages flying this flight simulator , and I honestly believed I could fly airplanes by the end of it .

Well in surgery , you couldn &apos;t have people who are more specialized and you couldn &apos;t have people who are better trained .
If you just run the simulation , it will just collapse , like this .
And this is the ability to program physical and biological materials to change shape , change properties and even compute outside of silicon-based matter .
I remember one particularly low moment .
And the maps of violence in most U.S. cities looked like this .
They are not meant to stay .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So we are natural-born dualists .
So what does play do for the brain ?
This has to be described as an adventure , not a burden .
Alzheimer &apos;s disease : there &apos;s five million people affected , and you can check vital signs , activity , balance .
And you start to see things .

What will we know ? What will we learn ?
So why are screens so pervasive in our analog life ?

One can become an object of public ridicule because of a misplaced B.
It &apos;s not one of these statistics which is very doubtful .
You sell your products more expensively .
And the large companies , they typically have wonderful wellness programs , but the medium-sized companies that typically fall between the cracks on issues like this , they started to get engaged and used our program as a model for their own employees to try and have contests to see who might be able to deal with their obesity situation in a way that could be proactively beneficial to others .
We &apos;re going to learn how to make one flap .
I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh gracious , if these two players , either one of them &quot; &quot; — they were different years , but I thought about each one at the time he was there — &quot; &quot; Oh , if he ever makes the varsity , our varsity must be pretty miserable , if he &apos;s good enough to make it . &quot; &quot; And you know , one of them was a starting player for a season and a half .
So the train is now pulling into the third stop along the 6 line .
And another story of the cylinder begins .
You &apos;re seeing a plot .
As a scientist , I always wanted to measure that resonance , that sense of the other that happens so quickly , in the blink of an eye .
Thinking , how can that be ? You &apos;re cheating . The lines are curved .
Secondly , in the Communist ideology , there &apos;s no place for criticism .
( Applause )
Again , chiming with your view that China has a militarized regime ready to , you know , mobilize its enormous forces .
This is a spectacular coral garden .
All right . I understand . If you &apos;re unwilling to — All right , well , we can discuss that after class .
I was not a great student .
But because so many of the issues in education aren &apos;t just in school , they &apos;re in family and community , what you also need , definitely , is more on the right hand side .
Imagine that that Earth is at the center of the universe , and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere .
You are somebody who wants to make a difference .

Once we &apos;ve discovered somebody has low vision , the next big challenge is to work out why , and to be able to do that , we need to have access to the inside of the eye .
There are different programs for graduate students , for executives at different companies .
And I wonder what he &apos;s soaking in .
I particularly like the little Linux penguin in the back . ( Laughter ) So one of the things that that &apos;s leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion .
The first paradox is that growing up is about rejecting the past and then promptly reclaiming it .
To just bring them to justice . &quot; &quot; But of course , they don &apos;t listen .
I should be able to ask my house where my shoes are .
So like the periodic table , we came up with our own table of the elements : new lifeforms that were computationally grown , additively manufactured and biologically augmented .
Here &apos;s the MR. It provides the framework .
The closer one gets , the more new features one discovers .
But there &apos;s also another problem from ships that I &apos;m illustrating here , and that &apos;s the problem of collision .
And to me this was a key component that somehow , through this medium of photography , which allows us to contemplate these landscapes , that I thought photography was perfectly suited to doing this type of work .
And there &apos;s a difference there too , because if we , you in the audience , or I , if we decide to have a designer baby , then their children will also be genetically modified , and so on , because it &apos;s heritable .
My head snapped back over my red seat .
That was designed on that machine , in the woods behind the Institute .
What I want to do more generally is to get you thinking about the place of uncertainty and randomness and chance in our world , and how we react to that , and how well we do or don &apos;t think about it .
He was strong , steady , disciplined .
I found this one watering hole , and felt if everything remained the same way it was behaving , I had a real opportunity to capture something unique .
( Laughter ) So I &apos;m sorry about that .
We &apos;re talking about energy .
It &apos;s fundamental to Darwin and Mendel and so on .
Thank you very much indeed . ( Applause )
Our city is very spread out .
I &apos;m going to argue that , in fact , business strategy has always been premised on assumptions about technology , that those assumptions are changing , and , in fact , changing quite dramatically , and that therefore what that will drive us to is a different concept of what we mean by business strategy .
I &apos;m a corporate lawyer most of the time for an organization called Enablis that supports entrepreneurs in South Africa .
And that &apos;s a little image of the tree of Stansted .
That all seems like win to me .
And I fell into those thousands of connections that I &apos;d made , and I asked my crowd to catch me .
There was no place to stay , so I stuck my computer in , I went away , came back after a couple of months , found kids playing games on it .
So , describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt . Go ahead .
And it &apos;s a rare fungus .
Principle number two : we have to recognize and celebrate diversity in this stuff .
However , huge supercomputer analyses , done of the likely effectiveness of this , show that it won &apos;t buy us much time at all .
What you &apos;ve done makes people laugh and then think .
And they know how to bring it back because they have demystified one big myth , which is the myth of spontaneity , which is that it &apos;s just going to fall from heaven while you &apos;re folding the laundry like a deus ex machina , and in fact they understood that whatever is going to just happen in a long-term relationship , already has .
So the idea is that we get the speed and efficiency benefits of using these physical dials together with the flexibility and versatility of a system that &apos;s designed in software .
So , there &apos;s plenty of non-zero-sumness .
Should one of them stop working or reduce hours to be home ?
In other words , they mastered the art of doing more with less , which is the essence of frugal innovation .
Left home .
So I think that actually step two , that I called a step a moment ago , isn &apos;t a step at all .
What am I doing this for ?
And a variety of other studies have shown that the microbial community that lives in and on us helps in development of the immune system , helps in fighting off pathogens , helps in our metabolism , and determining our metabolic rate , probably determines our odor , and may even shape our behavior in a variety of ways .
But unfortunately , he died prematurely in 1970 , and so he wasn &apos;t really able to live that dream completely .
It makes use of the GPS — you &apos;re familiar with GPS in your automobile , but you may not be familiar with the fact that there &apos;s a GPS U.S. , there &apos;s a Russian GPS , and there &apos;s a new GPS system going to Europe , called Galileo .
You know , that &apos;s not good enough .
It &apos;s even on thongs , but compressed to &quot; &quot; How about never — is never good for you ? &quot; &quot; Now these look like very different forms of humor but actually they bear a great similarity .
They said , one , the bridge doesn &apos;t exist .
If you go on , that &apos;s a slightly more complicated program that &apos;s now doing all sorts of algorithmic things and creating user interface and so on .
So I sent a cold email to info @ equaljusticeintiative.org : &quot; &quot; Dear Bryan , &quot; &quot; it said , &quot; &quot; I think your building project is maybe the most important project we could do in America and could change the way we think about racial injustice .

We find that if we get them out of institutions and into loving families early on , they recover their developmental delays , and go on to lead normal , happy lives .
Is it something as obvious as that jealousy , which boils down into person , desire , impediment , is such a solid narrative foundation ?
The experts call this the Girl Effect .
And before we have the debate , I &apos;d like to actually take a show of hands — on balance , right now , are you for or against this ?
For every dollar given to a women &apos;s program , 20 dollars are given to men &apos;s programs .
And what have you always wanted to ask someone from the other side ?
When the terrorist incidents occurred in the United Kingdom a couple of years ago , I think even though they didn &apos;t claim as many lives as we lost in the United States on 9 / 11 , I think the thing that troubled the British most was that the perpetrators were not invaders , but homegrown citizens whose religious and political identities were more important to them than the people they grew up with , went to school with , worked with , shared weekends with , shared meals with .
( Laughter ) If you put it next to contemporary architecture , it feels totally natural to me .
So I just want to welcome all of you onto the ride .
And it was through crowd-sourcing , it was through the kindness that strangers were showing me , that I could uncover parts of my past that were haunting me .
I &apos;ve been at this for 30 years , and in that time I &apos;ve seen the ability , the commitment , the will of government to do this decline , and I don &apos;t see them making a comeback right now .
I lived with incredible birds , incredible animals , I swam in our small rivers with our caimans .
And we keep setting our expectations higher and higher .
So don &apos;t hang on till the bitter end .
Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
But every generation has the chance to make it better .
And I &apos;m not going to take them somewhere and say , one day all of this will be yours .
They start at the surface of the brain , and then they dive down into the tissue itself , and as they spread out , they supply nutrients and oxygen to each and every cell in the brain .
What we want is to make sure that those individuals with autism can be free from the devastating consequences that come with it at times , the profound intellectual disabilities , the lack of language , the profound , profound isolation .
A-rhythm-etic . Audience : A-rhythm-etic .
They &apos;ve bounded the city with a line .
The president of Ethiopia said he would do it .
Naghma lived in a refugee camp with her parents and her eight brothers and sisters .
CA : So that seems like a win for the consumer .
So my moment of truth did not come all at once .
This is a very nice pattern , and it &apos;s true , because 5 + 5 = 2 • 5 , etc .
But it also tells us something about policy .
So you &apos;ve got a lot of information . That &apos;s great .
Now it &apos;s all done on my iPhone , and it all goes straight up to my server , and my server does all the backend work and categorizes things and puts everything together .
They are the slaves .
And yet what we proved then is the U.S. has more market power than OPEC .
How do we get that to a million ?
And he wished me luck and he gave me some free books and he showed me out the door .
By that I mean , not just the choice to use a gene drive , but also the choice not to use one .
Let me step back and take a look at why the city is so good for the blind .
That component is that we cannot be attached to outcome .
CA : Wait , wait , wait , not doing anything ?
We can also magnify small mechanical movements , like vibrations in engines , that can help engineers detect and diagnose machinery problems , or see how our buildings and structures sway in the wind and react to forces .
I went to Congo with MSF , and contributed to a book and an exhibition that focused attention on a forgotten war in which millions of people have died , and exposure to disease without treatment is used as a weapon .
And none of this takes more money and none of this demands a bureaucracy , but it does demand that you think things differently and you are prepared to bend budgets and work programs in order to create that supportive framework that communities can bounce off .
Except it &apos;s supposed to be brown .
Here , instead of through the lens of a genome , through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record .
( Laughter ) So , I couldn &apos;t let myself feel condescending towards these boys .
Now , David builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab , but before he does that , he works with dancers to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place .
Now , the best way of ending human suffering caused by war is to never go to war .
So let &apos;s start off by defining some terms .
You leave aside what is natural to be natural .
So when we went through the numbers , and just added that up — how much nuclear do we see China and India bringing online over the next 15 years , how much do we see at risk of being taken offline — this was the most startling finding .
Few high schoolers had access to computers in those days .
And that is , of course , Europe .
But of course , Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy .
In different contexts , cells do different things .
The life of a small-shareholder farmer is miserable .
And as you &apos;ll notice , it &apos;s still pretty gosh darn fast slowed down 333 times . It &apos;s an incredibly powerful movement .
In situations where you can &apos;t go about thinking how you &apos;d reverse this feeling of injustice , you can still think , maybe not what you can do , but what you can not do .
I blush whenever I show this .
So if this theory were true then it meant that light as it passed the sun should actually be bent around it .
Some of that &apos;s good : Oxfam , a great non-governmental actor .
And I have a volunteer subject in the audience today , Julie .
And in fact , if you compare it to data , it fits very well with the development of cities and economies .
And this is an excerpt from my first editor &apos;s letter , where I say that Rookie , we don &apos;t have all the answers , we &apos;re still figuring it out too , but the point is not to give girls the answers , and not even give them permission to find the answers themselves , but hopefully inspire them to understand that they can give themselves that permission , they can ask their own questions , find their own answers , all of that , and Rookie , I think we &apos;ve been trying to make it a nice place for all of that to be figured out .
And experience is not just a kind of entertainment in a non-casual way .
And who &apos;s responsible ? Designers .
And Yamaha makes an incredible thing called the Disklavier Pro that looks like a nice grand piano there .
It can be deadly .
So whatever you get that can make you happy can go away .
It &apos;s a very frightening , very , very frightening thought .
It is the same in the 21st century . That &apos;s why I am going to decide to give this machine only for poor women across India .
I remember a journal article about this new question answering software that had a graph .
Instead , she said , &quot; &quot; No , no . Work and leisure can be together . &quot; &quot; Yeah , that &apos;s particularly gorgeous — it &apos;s the TV dinner of 2001 .
It &apos;s out in the middle of the Pacific , right around the Equator .
So there was only one possibility — to bring the column out of the computer .
I hope when you learn things , like about how the natural world works — I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper or you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child .

The inventors don &apos;t know what the invention is .
This is the most disruptive technology — I &apos;ve been told by executives of the pesticide industry — that they have ever witnessed .

of my four-and-a-half-year commandship in that district , three years in , after putting pastors in the car with my police because I knew this — it &apos;s a little secret — I knew this : it was hard to stay a nasty police officer while you &apos;re riding around with a clergy .
Now the first interface is called a DriveGrip .
People &apos;s moral values , they &apos;re their most deeply held beliefs .
Thank you .
So what happens if you start to explain space to them ?

Now , Sylvia Browne is the big operator .
The conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold was able to learn .
I stay . If I go , I will be killed .
And by rating it and by rating the different people who submit information , we can get refined results and weighted results .

I was at the top of the General Assembly just looking down into it and seeing it happen .
She looks at me like I &apos;m her , you know , her moron child , the cretin , the one she &apos;s got to speak to very slowly and distinctly .
And so that &apos;s what makes me lie awake at night , I guess , you know .
There are people now online that are friends ; they &apos;ve never met .
Now I have carefully cropped this sequence to be exactly the duration of a human eye blink , so in the time that it would take you to blink your eye , the fly has seen this looming predator , estimated its position , initiated a motor pattern to fly it away , beating its wings at 220 times a second as it does so .
Lots of people are used to having a spiritual tribe , or a church tribe , having a work tribe , having a community tribe .
If I zoom on it , you can see : that &apos;s the Rover on the surface .

( Laughter ) Every country is different and it &apos;s confusing , okay ?
And in the intervening years I had two daughters .
And now , brrrrrrrrrr , just like when you were a kid .
It was complex , but there was something capricious about its complexity .
But that doesn &apos;t mean we shouldn &apos;t do everything in our power to protect the environments that we rely and depend on , and like Everest , the remote location and inadequate infrastructure of the orbital environment make waste disposal a challenging problem .
And that &apos;s also a higher hurdle . People drop out .
Audience : 1966 .
To the top right of the graph , are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well-being , but they &apos;re using a lot of planet to get there .
So the next time a victim of a privacy violation comes up to you , instead of blaming them , let &apos;s do this instead : let &apos;s shift our ideas about digital privacy , and let &apos;s respond with compassion .
But it &apos;s still true that a neuron , a nerve cell , looks the same in a crayfish , a bird or you .
He would promote the policeman immediately , so that P.C. Bloggs became Detective Inspector Bloggs in the course of the conversation and wave us on merrily .
Let &apos;s see by a show of hands .
Why don &apos;t we see more innovation in sanitation ?
But we can let that insecurity make us brittle or supple .
It &apos;s a simple choice , so we &apos;ve worked for many years with the Forest Stewardship Council , with literally hundreds of other organizations , and there &apos;s a point here about collaboration .

And here &apos;s an example .
The issue of privacy and personal data is much bigger than just the government , and so learn the facts .
When this happened to me 17 years ago , there was no name for it .
And when I have the question , it is a focus .
Take a look at Gabby .
The landscape has sadly become much more populated with instances like mine , whether or not someone actually make a mistake , and now it &apos;s for both public and private people .
So , the tiger is the icon .
And we have to resist to the changes .
And one of the first things that we discovered that I think is really helpful for understanding polarization is to understand that the political divide in our country is undergirded by a deeper moral divide .
And when the sun shines , you get copious quantities of these things , called neutrinos , pouring out .
Crossing miles and miles of sastrugi — frozen ice snowdrifts that could be hip-deep .
But what you do know is that that introduction was nothing short of transformative .
One of my viewer &apos;s uncles died on a particular day and he chose to commemorate it with a piece of hate .
I &apos;ve met a lot of them .
If she is married to a man she doesn &apos;t like or if she is married to an old man , she has to accept , because she does not want to be dubbed as disobedient .

( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) SB : We ended up at what was advertised as the world &apos;s largest speed dating event .
So there is this key benefit that is relevant to state policy makers in terms of economic development .
The thing that caused massive policy changes to occur was Race to the Top for education .
And we learn and adapt the program accordingly .
And that was the job of the journalist . It was filtering all this stuff .
They are all remodeled . They all become specialized for the task at hand .
Quite nice in itself , they &apos;re little , sort of , airplane things .

When you have a non-stick pan , it costs about , maybe , 250 rupees , five dollars , six dollars .
Eighty-five to 95 percent of species at this time die out , and simultaneous to that is a huge , dramatic spike in carbon dioxide , that a lot of scientists agree comes from a simultaneous eruption of volcanoes and a runaway greenhouse effect .
It means that you can &apos;t get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so much .
Is it a part of a circle ?
We feel awkward and shameful talking about it .
DP : When a guy is happily married , no matter what happens at work , no matter what happens in the rest of the day , there &apos;s a shelter when you get home , there &apos;s a knowledge knowing that you can hug somebody without them throwing you downstairs and saying , &quot; &quot; Get your hands off me . &quot; &quot; Being married is like having a color television set .

CA : But to make this happen , you have to look at each part in the chain — the police , who else ?
I also see a world where we can erase unwanted memories .
But it &apos;s also useful , because it tells us that extreme simplicity in movement rules at the individual level can result in a great deal of complexity at the level of the group .
Bia &apos;s school stayed in place .
But let &apos;s start off by remembering that Darwin showed how we &apos;re the outcome of four billion years of evolution .
It was around this time we went from 1K to 16K , which was quite the leap .
Now , like Doc Edgerton , a scientist himself , science became art — an art of ultra-fast photography .
( Applause )
For every four barrels of oil that we consume , we only discover one .
The more I thought about it , I realized , no , it &apos;s still important .
And in just four weeks , the brain learns to process this new sensation and acquires a new sensory pathway — like a new sense .
It gives it information . By adding information to matter , it gives it a function that &apos;s different than without that structure .
But we also know it &apos;s only through experiment that we &apos;ll discover exactly how to run a low carbon city , how to care for a much older population , how to deal with drug addiction and so on .
As a matter of fact , we added to the contract .
( Applause ) We &apos;ve hired and trained hundreds of facilitators to help guide people through the experience .
He said , &quot; &quot; What do you think it &apos;s like trying to run a country with 400 kinds of cheese ? &quot; &quot; But at the same time , we realize that our products are not safe and healthy .

What you just heard is &quot; &quot; Skylife &quot; &quot; by David Balakrishnan .
She said things she &apos;d always needed to say .
We also recognize that a lot of the products that we make — those videos and so forth — you know , they don &apos;t reach everybody , and so we &apos;ve been fostering projects that reach people outside of academia , and outside of the choir that most ecologists preach to .
This is why basically you have all this creative mistrust between the representatives and those whom they represent .
Over the course of last year , open-source hardware hackers have come up with multiple models for usable , Linux-based mobile phones , and the Earth Phone could spin off from this kind of project .
The greek word poem , it just means &quot; &quot; a made thing , &quot; &quot; and poetry is a set of techniques , ways of making patterns that put emotions into words .
So that &apos;s an asset because if you &apos;ve got to deal with the crash protection issues of the automobile , forget it — you &apos;re never going to fly it .
Now , the irony is , of course , that every large company started off as a small , entrepreneurial company .

There were no Motel 6 &apos;s or Howard Johnsons for me .
And then the kids graduate , and you have no responsibility any more — that &apos;s very good , too .
( Applause )
And that will stop reusing a syringe 20 or 30 times .
I asked them to name me just 20 .
So you ask yourself , if education has become so much more expensive , has it become so much better ?
Think Enron , Madoff , the mortgage crisis .
It &apos;s an acknowledgment of need or fallibility .
If you look over the past couple decades at the returns to capital — in other words , corporate profits — we see them going up , and we see that they &apos;re now at an all-time high .
And I pressed her , and I asked her , &quot; Why did you come back and get your care here ? &quot;

It &apos;s a giant airbag .
But that all happened later .
It appears that the more secretions she &apos;s got , the more likely the baby is to suckle quickly .
These are the sounds you would expect , but they are also the sounds of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds screeching in the night , the high-pitched honest cries of children and the thunderous , unbearable silence .
They have invented narco-submarines and boats that are not detected by radar .
There &apos;s consequences for carbonate organisms .
But when it comes to our cities and thinking about how death fits in our cities , there &apos;s much less regulation and design and thought than we might imagine .

Last year , I told you the story , in seven minutes , of Project Orion , which was this very implausible technology that technically could have worked , but it had this one-year political window where it could have happened .
And yeah , sub-atomic physics is deconstructive . You literally try to tear atoms apart to understand what &apos;s inside of them . But sculpture , from what I understand from great sculptors , is deconstructive , because you see a piece and you remove what doesn &apos;t need to be there .
These cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field , like a screen .

So we ask the question again , &quot; &quot; How many straight lines can I draw through the point , but never meet the original line ? &quot; &quot; Does someone want to guess ?
Good question . There are two main reasons .

( Laughter ) And here is our factory in Cape Town where we make horses .
There were a lot of them .
We have identified over 400 species of bees in Pennsylvania .
On the other hand , you &apos;re doing something new , no one &apos;s ever done before , you get it completely wrong . How should you be treated ?

In Africa last year , Africans ate 600 million wild animals , and consumed two billion kilograms of bush meat .
Unfortunately , empirical data , good , hard stats , don &apos;t exist , and therefore to prove my point , I first of all had to find some proxy way of uncovering how much food was being wasted .
And they kind of took me into the farm and showed me what it was like to live and work .
That &apos;s great , except the places that have malaria really bad , they don &apos;t have health care systems .

Mom says , &quot; &quot; If they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them , you must always say , &apos; Nothing . &apos; And if they insist , say , &apos; Whatever you mind to give me . &apos; &quot; &quot; This was the nature of being at that table .
Thank you very much .
Perhaps the tremendous progress we &apos;ve made over the last century by a series of forces are , in fact , accelerating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of abundance .
So no ego problems .
So I &apos;m very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross-section of my work that I &apos;ve done on the polar regions .
CA : To a lay person it seems like he has certain things to offer the U.S. , the government , you , others , in terms of putting things right and helping figure out a smarter policy , a smarter way forward for the future .
We can understand how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation that was set down 13.72 billion years ago — and yet , we can do calculations today to predict how it will look and it matches .
I guess we could make a glow chicken .
The driving cities in the Sun Belt , the Dallases and the Phoenixes and , sorry , Atlanta , these cities are not appearing on the list .

These people don &apos;t mind that I once worked as a singing waitress to help pay for college .
We only get one , and wow , did we ever get a good one .
What release finally , the embrace : though we were wary — it seemed so audacious — how much unspoken joy there was in that affirmation of equality and communion , no matter how much misunderstanding and pain had passed between you by then .
Would you like a better system ?
And to remind you that here is an example in which architecture actually did something .
One value of older people is that they are increasingly useful as grandparents for offering high-quality childcare to their grandchildren , if they choose to do it , as more young women enter the workforce and as fewer young parents of either gender stay home as full-time caretakers of their children .
My background should have led me to a different direction .
MR : Thank you very much indeed , Cynthia Kenyon .

Much of the debate in the U.S. has been about metadata .
That conflict , that tension , will be with us forever , that sometimes it wants to do what it wants to do , and sometimes it &apos;s going to do things for us .

Read that great piece in the New Yorker about how our echo boomers , 19 to 25 , over in Iraq taught each other how to do Sys Admin work , over the Internet in chat rooms .
How risky is this ?
What we need are for people to care , to actually go use it , just like they &apos;ve cared enough to use Kiva to make those connections .

And I remember this plan , born out of frustration from a kid who kept calling me &quot; &quot; Yogi , &quot; &quot; then pointed at my tummy and said , &quot; &quot; Too many picnic baskets . &quot; &quot; Turns out it &apos;s not that hard to trick someone , and one day before class , I said , &quot; Yeah , you can copy my homework , &quot; and I gave him all the wrong answers that I &apos;d written down the night before .
There are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them , and one of them is here in the audience , Marian Peeters , who &apos;s in the picture .

He &apos;s going to listen and be really interested .
Now , how do I know that I &apos;m right about this somewhat confusing poem ?
People seem to think politics is sexy .
There I would hear people say my father was a &quot; &quot; moudjahid &quot; &quot; and that means &quot; &quot; fighter . &quot; &quot; Later on , in France , I loved eavesdropping on grownups &apos; conversations , and I would hear all sorts of stories about my father &apos;s previous life , especially that he had &quot; &quot; done &quot; &quot; World War II , that he had &quot; &quot; done &quot; &quot; the Algerian war .
So as I shake this ketchup bottle , I get some true sensory feedback as the function of time in the bottom row .

Peter Diamandis : Probably the most difficult thing that I had to do was raise the capital for this . It was literally impossible .
It &apos;s a business plan for a corporation .
Okay , now why then is this curious reluctance and curious hostility to consciousness ?
For example , the psychologist Daniel Oppenheimer , a few years ago , teamed up with high school teachers .
&quot; Please get FISA right . &quot;
And he was working on gyroscopes ; he has a number of patents for that kind of thing .
So , these are early examples in the lab of emerging technologies to digitize fabrication . Computers that don &apos;t control tools but computers that are tools , where the output of a program rearranges atoms as well as bits .
And here &apos;s what that means for us .
So very carefully we had to mechanically scrape off all the wax .
TK : That hand &apos;s not so good for clapping .
Other ones are kind of going like this . All right .
Because what happens in a singly-linked list — this is trying to remove an existing entry from a list — and there &apos;s a difference between if it &apos;s the first entry or whether it &apos;s an entry in the middle .
They were reeling from the earthquake , they were reeling from cholera that was brought in by UN peacekeepers and still hasn &apos;t been eradicated .
So here &apos;s an image of red blood cells , and now we can actually map where the hemozoin and where the malaria parasites are inside those red blood cells .
It &apos;s important for us to grow organically .
But he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me to work directly for him in the White House .

They were sitting at a table . They were brought together for us .
So , close to 200,000 people a day migrate from the rural to the urban areas .
It &apos;s very ironic .
And I &apos;ve been thinking a lot about what I have learned over these last particularly 11 years with V-Day and &quot; &quot; The Vagina Monologues , &quot; &quot; traveling the world , essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet to stop violence against women .
In fact , when we run the numbers , it looks like it &apos;ll take us at least 15 years before we can fully finance all our conservation efforts .
And I &apos;m only showing you a little bit of this .
Thank you Frans de Waal , wherever you are , I love you and I &apos;d give anything to meet you .
And this is what we spend a lot of our time doing , is just making sure that we can keep up with this kind of traffic load .
And essentially , the oceans are breathing through the Southern Ocean .
You &apos;re wrong , because it &apos;s the opposite .
The stories of the colonoscopies were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
The only way you can do that is to not swim on top of the water .
The way I look back in the past is by using the fossilized remains of deepwater corals .
And I was getting it all on film and I was recording it , and I was thinking , &quot; &quot; This is it . This is the possibility of it maybe working .
Dreams are a form of consciousness on this definition .
So , there &apos;s this guy , right ? Victorian era .
And I would like to make a case to you that over the years since we first developed atomic weaponry , until this very moment , we &apos;ve actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world that &apos;s characterized by two phases , which I &apos;m going to go through with you right now .
The first one is harm / care .
Jay Chiat is a glutton for punishment , and he hired me to do a house for him in the Hamptons .
But the bird , instead of flying away , goes flop , flop , flop and lands on my head .
That &apos;s how the system &apos;s supposed to work .
CK : Yes , that &apos;s right .
There is different type of barbaria .
And then sort of through a process of wandering around , I got to the thought that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars , in a way that is convenient and affordable , you could get to a solution .
Number one : China feels as if it &apos;s been humiliated at the hands of the West through a hundred years of history , beginning with the Opium Wars .

I started a foundation to bet on these good people doing good things .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve misjudged this women , &quot; &quot; thought Mr. Dickens .
But what I want to point out is you can buy this from iTunes .
You &apos;re going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , I gave myself the job title of TED Custodian for a reason , and I will promise you right here and now that the core values that make TED special are not going to be interfered with .
He was trying to tell people how they should live through the medium of sermons , the classic medium of delivery of religions .
And there &apos;s Evan .
And so I &apos;ll just go get them .
And sometimes it &apos;s about a legacy of the neighborhood , like in Morrisania , about the jazz history .
So when I went through the data , I had very surprising results , because I found that four out of the five marinating ingredients actually inhibited the carcinogen formation .
How many inventors and untold entrepreneurs live out this phenomenon ?
And fundamentally , it &apos;s a story about how starting as very small children and continuing out all the way to the greatest accomplishments of our culture , we get the world right .
I don &apos;t see anybody actually being able to do that very effectively .
What I &apos;m showing you again here is this map of the Human Microbiome Project Data , so each point represents a sample from one body site from one of 250 healthy adults .
I recognize the pain they caused to others , for which there can be no forgiveness , but the pain they caused to me , there is , &quot; &quot; she said .
And if not , can you make yourself smart again ?
Those girls have never touched Google .
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have , which is the choice overload problem .
And Afghanistan , Afghanistan , we think has probably stopped polio repeatedly .
EH : Not bad .
We don &apos;t know how far it will go , but it &apos;s going on .
He had a bold idea that — what he called the cognitive trade-off hypothesis .
So here &apos;s the situation .
I like the idea of collaboration with people like that because it pushes you .
We are policing the world , and how are we doing that ?
Bob Dylan is 23 years old , and his career is just reaching its pinnacle .
War and malnutrition kills people together with hope .
And the reason it does is not because of the clever encryption .
Now , I know what you &apos;re thinking .
( Laughter ) Yeah .
OK , that &apos;s fair enough .
The next bit , we &apos;d chartered a pretty elderly Russian plane to fly us up to a town called Khatanga , which was the sort of last bit of civilization .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ve had these people approach you before .
I have faith , for instance , that peace in the Middle East is possible despite the ever-accumulating mass of evidence to the contrary .
So how we use yeast in the future is going to be really interesting .
So these are a couple of instrumentalists .
Everest is an extreme environment .
That &apos;s what the experience of the last 20 years has been .
On the other end of the spectrum , some were so sick they had to live in complete darkness , unable to tolerate the sound of a human voice or the touch of a loved one .
Maybe some of you have received an email that says something like , &quot; &quot; Hi , I &apos;m a Nigerian banker , and I &apos;d like to give you 53 billion dollars because I like your face . &quot; &quot; Or funnycats.exe , which rumor has it was quite successful in China &apos;s recent campaign against America .
If someone was to throw an egg at the Sistine Chapel , we &apos;d all go crazy .
( Music ) And so they &apos;re beautiful , but this libertarian has some important lessons he wants us to learn from this .
And so we prospered in a way that no other animal has .
And it didn &apos;t stop there .
So after I returned home , I received word that one member of the family had been shot 30 times in the face .
And then we took these flies and allowed them to make choices .
But in this country , where the government apparently does not feel compelled to provide health care for citizens , ( Laughter ) we &apos;ve taken a very different approach .
All four of my oars broke before I reached halfway across .
Hello ?
But this one is — the Bible says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month , and more than that , you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat .
So , why is that ?
It may just take the right crazy idea .
So in this image , what you can see is that everything smaller than five nanometers is going from the blood , through the kidney , into the urine , and everything else that &apos;s bigger is retained .
( Audience : Random . ) Michael Sandel : At random . You would do it by lottery .
But when you get specific , when you actually ask about the actual taxing and spending issues under consideration , people are remarkably centrist , they &apos;re remarkably open to compromise .
So every second , half of the Library of Congress is swooshing around in this machine . It &apos;s a big machine .
And you all know that if you are going to determine whether you &apos;re related to your brother or your sister , you can &apos;t do it by looking at differences .
Now , technology has changed a lot since the Victrola days .
So with all these theatric elements , this pushes me in another role , and that would be , possibly , the dramaturge .
We &apos;ve discovered things like , for example , RNA interference only a few years ago , and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work .
So let &apos;s make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana .
Just think of Sebastian and how he bought the cat to influence his .
The person I believed for half of my life to have superpowers suddenly needed help to get dressed or to cut food .
The good news is I &apos;m very aware of my responsibilities to get you out of here because I &apos;m the only thing standing between you and the bar .
Not enough to stabilize the climate .
Who &apos;s not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings — if you &apos;re different from all the other beings ?
And then you &apos;d see an image of Britney Spears to remind you of this funny anecdote you want to tell .
Take the planet Venus .
( Music ) But basically , it &apos;s just a B , with four sads .
( Laughter ) So , I took a look at my life , a hard look at my life , and I saw some things very disturbing . ( Laughter )
And I don &apos;t mean the whole economy , because to grow an economy of India to the size of U.K. — that &apos;s a piece of cake , with one billion people .
On the other side , there is this girl .
And some people think that &apos;s a good thing .
Right ? And then I realized , that was on my website , and then it said , like , you know , the quote was attributed to me and I thought , oh , I said something , you know , in an interview .
It &apos;s got a remarkably clear yes / no answer , and just requires phenomenal grunt .
I hope that you will take a look at it .
( Laughter ) But , you know , I could pop a book on in the middle of the night , and — ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now , the Kurzweil reader is simply a program on my laptop .
They would not leave me alone until I let them have a piece , but it was not a good one . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , it occurred to me that I should invite Dr. Robicsek to lecture at Wofford College on — what else ?
Education is often of poor quality .
And if they &apos;re on a smartphone on Google , they &apos;ve got access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton did 15 years ago .
&quot; &quot; Strange , &quot; &quot; he agreed .
I &apos;m excited when I glimpse that kind of thinking writ large .
I &apos;m a historian by training , and what I study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy — meaning human bodies , animal bodies — how they dealt with bodily fluids , concepts of bodies ; how have they thought about bodies .
However , I longed to share my life with someone .
But yes there are some solutions .
And when this story posted , I ran to my computer to send it to the IMF official .
Yeah , you all have a body , right ?
It stayed here and tried not to move any part of its body .
Next is Maynard Sipes .
Guys , we have an issue .
If you look at birds , which live a long time , cells from the birds tend to be more resistant to a lot of different environmental stresses like high temperature or hydrogen peroxide , things like that .
And that begins to lift a heavy burden off the world &apos;s poor .
Here &apos;s another case that I think is interesting .
What has changed our society has been wireless devices .
How important is this ?
It means that you have to save more today .
I don &apos;t quite mean that the golden rule itself is written in our genes , but you can go to a hunter gatherer society that has had no exposure to any of the great religious traditions , no exposure to ethical philosophy , and you &apos;ll find , if you spend time with these people , that , basically , they believe that one good turn deserves another , and that bad deeds should be punished .
He came up with our name and logo . We &apos;re Mission Motors .
Now , years ago , when I was working at YouTube , we were looking for ways to encourage more people to rate videos , and it was interesting because when we looked into the data , we found that almost everyone was exclusively using the highest five-star rating , a handful of people were using the lowest one-star , and virtually no one was using two , three or four stars .
I made a promise that the next time I would fly around the world , it would be with no fuel , independent from fossil energies , in order to be safe , not to be threatened by the fuel gauge .
If you remember what I told you about FLS at the beginning , it &apos;s knowledge and skills .
( Laughter ) Okay . Okay . Oh , well .
Now , in the 20th century we had a revolution that was initiated at the beginning of the 20th century , and which is still going on .
And I don &apos;t think that we should give up on beauty .
Why don &apos;t we take it a little longer — maybe two hours instead of an hour — and have less of this intensity ? &quot; &quot; And the nurses told me two things .
How well are we doing determining what piece to move where ?
They just thought , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;ll give a course of 10 .
And no tricky shit behind the thing . I mean , it &apos;s all — you &apos;ve got to be very honest with what you &apos;re doing if it really is going to work .
The idea is that the building blocks of the digital economy are connectivity and entrepreneurship .
And I think we probably do need to pay some more attention to that , because it &apos;s actually kind of fragile .
And at seven o &apos;clock every night , I took me some more girls , already corrupted .
They have learned their lesson . They will control .
( Applause )
NL : I am the peer of whoever I &apos;m talking to .
Thank you .
Unfortunately , I don &apos;t fly trans-Atlantic business class often enough to know , or any other kind of business class really , but I assume that in business class , you don &apos;t hear many expressions of , you know , bigotry about racial groups or ethnic groups , because the people who are flying trans-Atlantic business class are doing business with all these people ; they &apos;re making money off all these people . And I really do think that , in that sense at least , capitalism has been a constructive force , and more fundamentally , it &apos;s a non-zero-sumness that has been a constructive force in expanding people &apos;s realm of moral awareness . I think the non-zero-sum dynamic ,
Sometimes I can stand before the world — and when I say this , transformation is a difficult and slow process — sometimes I can stand before the world and say , &quot; &quot; My name is Chris Abani .
OK , so , confession : I &apos;ve always been weirdly obsessed with advertising .
And different people will have different places they want it set .
So this is a picture of me holding one of the first watercolor paintings I ever made .
Men have sex before marriage , and people more or less turn a blind eye .
In fact , nothing expresses that assumption more clearly than three simple numbers : 9-1-1 , which , of course , is the number for the emergency police operator here in Canada and in the United States , where the average response time to a police 911 emergency call is about 10 minutes .
But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first .
TBL : Can you say &quot; &quot; now &quot; &quot; ?
As an absolute connection , it only works one way .
And on the other end of the spectrum , this is a microstructure .
( Laughter ) And when she saw him , he was down on one knee , he had the ring out .
Now we can take the words and start to build sentences out of them .
But then he decides , &quot; Let me tweak my tactics a little bit . &quot;
So this is a plate of nachos .
There &apos;s something that it feels like to drink beer which is not what it feels like to do your income tax or listen to music , and this qualitative feel automatically generates a third feature , namely , conscious states are by definition subjective in the sense that they only exist as experienced by some human or animal subject , some self that experiences them .
They &apos;re all searching for their staircase .
Office worker : Got a ham and swiss on rye ? BM : No .
So I don &apos;t know , it started to become an interesting mix .
You degrade forests , you go beyond the boundary on land , you undermine the ability of the climate system to stay stable .
I pushed back .
If you really want great hamburger , it turns out it makes a difference if you align the grain .
It would have the interdisciplinarity of the TED Conference .
That &apos;s one of the themes that Sylvia reminds us about : understand this ocean of ours , this basic life support system , the dominant life support system on the planet .
And we &apos;d sing this old song . She didn &apos;t have a whole lot of energy , so I &apos;d sing , &quot; &quot; Hey , hey ! &quot; &quot; and she &apos;d just answer back with , &quot; &quot; Black-eyed Susie . &quot; &quot; Oh , hey , hey , black-eyed Susie ! Hey , hey , black-eyed Susie !
And fortunately , in the course of this project , the transplant surgeons and the other people decided , forget common practice . We have to switch .
( Laughter ) So in the studio , rather than drawing , we began to learn how to knit .
There is some modeling of ecosystems going on now .
And from , you know , Fattushis , to Taxistan to , you know , for the Fashtoonks , Botoxia , Pashmina , Khlintunisia , you know , we were able to take the city and make fun of this completely foreign , who are — what &apos;s going on over here ?
This is why I can wear my gho with pride .
But then I thought , oh , I &apos;m sending myself mixed messages .
Maybe we don &apos;t recognize it every time , but we understand that it happens .
I do dream in X-ray . I see my projects in my sleep .
And this is just a very simple way of understanding what kind of innovation , what kind of different design we need .
Literally hundreds of elevator rides were spent with me alone stuffing the pump into my Spanx , hoping the doors wouldn &apos;t open unexpectedly .
And what hotel means , in Kenya and India , is an eating-place .
( Applause )
Talk to any astrophysicist .
As you get towards the 1970s , things are going to start to change .
Some of them were toys . Some of them were candy .
And if you don &apos;t know them , that &apos;s okay . Most casual players probably do .
From my American perspective , when a paying customer makes a reasonable request based on her preferences , she has every right to have that request met .
It &apos;s just a question to use some techniques like the time lapse .
I know most people don &apos;t see it that way .
Food can be there and people can &apos;t buy it .
Jihad may at times take the form of fighting , but only sometimes , under strict conditions , within rules and limits .
Take , for example , the incidents of suicide baiting .
Here &apos;s another one . Bang .
He went into a coma .
So there &apos;s some that are all about the toast , and all about the transformation of toast .
It took me weeks of internal thinking to try to reconcile the good reasons we had to assist that family and the soldier of fortune he became .
And it seemed like time that we become that way ourselves .
Well , I thought there would be a podium , so I &apos;m a bit scared .
And in that sense , ballooning is a beautiful metaphor .
Should I take vitamin C ? Should I be taking wheatgrass ?
We hired a team of physicists , software engineers and biologists to work on this , and the first thing we had to work on was to create the human body , basically .
My story begins right here actually in Rajasthan about two years ago .
Just a few examples : an artist who paints with fluorescent Physarum ; a collaborative team who are combining biological and electronic design with 3D printing technologies in a workshop ; another artist who is using the slime mold as a way of engaging a community to map their area .
But in fact , in a few years , organizations will know so much about us , they will be able to infer our desires before we even form them , and perhaps buy products on our behalf before we even know we need them .
I have to say , these are very hybrid places .
We were spending so much time with this leopard and getting to understand her individualism , her personal character , that maybe we were taking it a little bit far .
And just to give you a flavor of how well this works , this is the result we get when we analyze this for some familiar words .
What &apos;s missing ? What would I like to know ?
This is bringing together international — there are 50 nations involved in this mission — interagency — these development agencies — and private-public , to take on this kind of security .
The scientific embargo — if it &apos;s ever submitted to &quot; &quot; Nature , &quot; &quot; hopefully , it will be accepted .
I &apos;m a member of the Blackfeet Nation .
It &apos;s a satellite that goes into space , which is probably the least open-source thing you can imagine , and it contains an Arduino connected to a bunch of sensors . So if you know how to use Arduino , you can actually upload your experiments into this satellite and run them .
They &apos;ve been bombed by the military , they &apos;ve been besieged , they &apos;ve been stormed by ISIS and they &apos;ve been cut off from supplies for years .
It &apos;s about the same as yours and mine .
I think , if you live with your head in the clouds every now and then , it helps you keep your feet on the ground .
Let &apos;s look at the Pantheon and the Piazza della Rotonda in front of it .
I &apos;ve been building topsoil .
You &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; Aha , but New Zealand has a higher GDP than Chad ! &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a good point , well made .
I was a new mother and a young rabbi in the spring of 2004 and the world was in shambles .
So the country in the world with the highest social progress , the number one country on social progress is New Zealand .
When did we originate as a species ?
So the 20th century , then , saw how much more complex reality was , but it also saw a positive side .
They couldn &apos;t hear what I was saying in the context of a 10 back-to-back PowerPoint presentation conference .
Soon , you &apos;ll be able to look inside your brain and program , control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there .
And I &apos;m not talking about all comedy here , because , clearly , there &apos;s plenty of humor that colors safely within the lines of what we already think and feel .
Now we &apos;ve got the data , plus we have metadata .
You &apos;ve gone through hundreds of TV channels , just switching channel after channel , and then suddenly you actually stop on one .
I have won a lot of awards through this work .
Leandro started a campaign using one of our tools , the Pressure Cooker , the same one that Bia and Jovita used , and the state government changed their minds before Christmas Eve .
So what you do one day is you take a pile of arrowheads , and you walk up to the one that can &apos;t speak very well , and you put the arrowheads down in front of him , hoping that he &apos;ll get the idea that you want to trade your arrowheads for finished arrows .
There &apos;s also a huge emotional impact .
RB : Yeah , as it turned out , it proved to be the right move .
Well , you know , sometimes the most important things come in the smallest packages .
The important question is , &quot; &quot; Is it interesting ? &quot; &quot; And I follow this question , not worrying about &quot; &quot; Is it music ? &quot; &quot; — not worrying about the definition of the thing that I &apos;m making .
Then you can look at the ratios of those numbers , and figure out for a data center where you don &apos;t have that information , you can figure out , but maybe you only have one of those , you know the square footage , then you could figure out well , maybe the power is proportional .
In contrast , they will walk an extra mile to avoid people who are not having fun .
I received a poignant tweet .
Well , we &apos;ve seen that that can &apos;t be true .
On the other , the non-U.S.-related threats out of those 54 , the other 42 of them , the PRISM program was hugely relevant to that , and in fact was material in contributing to stopping those attacks .
And she looked at me , and she said , &quot; &quot; But , Aimee , that &apos;s not fair . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And the incredible thing was she really meant it .
JB : It &apos;s so powerful . Richard Ford , who &apos;s won the Pulitzer Prize , says that dyslexia helped him write sentences .
It made it possible for us to take close-up pictures of people 100 kilomteres away , like this one . ( Laughter ) People called us and asked , how is this man doing ?
And they &apos;re coming into the city by rail .
Now I &apos;m going to play the burst for you .
From &apos; 83 to &apos; 95 : two percent per annum .
So if we had some way to stop this scaling — and so I picked up some shells on the beach . And I asked them , what is scaling ? What &apos;s inside your pipes ?
This is all done in between the ribs .
It &apos;s just love . That &apos;s all it is .
So we &apos;ve developed certain tactics and strategies to cover up .
The paper you &apos;re holding in your hand contains the details of Iraqi civilians that died as result of the invasion .
Thus 900,000 people either have died or have significant damage to their heart muscle .
And she makes them so they could either be broken up into payments , or they could be like these , which are leaves that can be payments .
Pretty quickly I saw that if you had more than a few values you &apos;d never remember on the screen where things were .
For me , the design exercise always begins here with the periodic table , enunciated by another professor , Dimitri Mendeleyev .
Because even through the squeaks of his hearing aids , his understanding of music was profound .
In June 2010 , Internet changed my life forever .
And I says , &quot; &quot; Well , try me . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; But I don &apos;t believe that you can do this . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; So , to cut a long story short , I went home , went underneath the microscope , and I crushed up a piece of glass , crushed it up .
The next moment , as soon as they finished and disappeared into the shadows , a young man with a propane lantern came on , hung it up on a tree , set up a curtain .
Now , these ideas and these events allow us even to deconstruct iconic places that many of you have been to , like Machu Picchu .
I could feel the wind against my face and the beat of my racing heart as if it were happening in that very moment .
And maybe something else .
Now , the balance that I try to fight for , I , as any good liberal , try to fight for first by looking to the government . Total mistake , right ?
Instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem , design the solution around what the human will do as well .
These legs that I was on , which I &apos;ll take out right now — I was the first person in the world on these legs .
I &apos;ll just take you to Bangladesh for a minute .
The computer was cracked open .

Then you can of course always go and see this guy .
It &apos;s the coolest stuff .
Now , why would neuroscientists say that we don &apos;t just construct , we reconstruct ?
But some day , some day , maybe it &apos;s going to work .
So Netra was stuck with 30 paintings of mine .

We don &apos;t know what the atmospheres of these planets are like because the planets are so small and dim compared to their stars and so far away from us .
And if everything goes smoothly , one to two weeks from now you &apos;ll know where the epidemic was today .

How about 40 ? Okay , it &apos;s a whole varied response .
It all started when we at CERN saw something intriguing in our data : a hint of a new particle , an inkling of a possibly extraordinary answer to this question .
In Northern California , we &apos;re beginning to take observations with the first 42 telescopes of the Allen Telescope Array — and I &apos;ve got to take a moment right now to publicly thank Paul Allen and Nathan Myhrvold and all the TeamSETI members in the TED community who have so generously supported this research .

But this is not a very efficient way to organize a regulation of wealth dynamics .
So let me show you the scene , and then I basically used the trick that was identified by Sergei Eisenstein , which is , if you have a camera that &apos;s moving with a moving object , what is not moving appears to be moving , and what is moving appears to be stopped , so what you &apos;re actually seeing now is the train is not moving at all , and what is actually moving is the floor .
In this country , if we win the election , we are going to make all government spending over 25,000 pounds transparent and available online , searchable for anyone to see .
Sooner or later , sooner or later , the rule of history is that where power goes governance must follow .
So really the resolution is quite incredible .
It shows a cockroach moving over incredibly rough terrain without tipping over , and it &apos;s able to do this because its legs are a combination of rigid materials , which is what we traditionally use to make robots , and soft materials .
And there are hints of this .
Now this is a real project that we worked on , literally , you would not believe how hard .
If you are a bit short in mathematical skills , don &apos;t worry .
So here &apos;s the thing .

As a quarter of the world population is influenced by it , you &apos;d be wise to do something about that .
So we documented this invention step by step on a website for inventors called Instructables , in the hope that somebody would make it even better .
And this is so powerful that when they tweak their stats , when they say your crops wilt after eight hours , or after six hours , or after 24 hours , it changes the life cycle of some 70 million people during the day .

And you might say , &quot; &quot; Can you really be that specific ?
And on the surface , Cassini has found liquid .
What &apos;s it gonna look like ? We have huge grand challenges these days of habitat loss . We have more and more people , billions of people , in 100 years , God knows how many people , and how little space there will be to fit all of them , so we need to change the way that we see cities , and looking at this picture on the left of New York City today , you can see how gray and brown it is .

And in the spring , when the sun returns to the ice , it forms the phytoplankton , grows under that ice , and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed , and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life .
And we quickly realized that our coming together was more than just a union of two people , but was a model of possibility for the millions of LGBTQ folks who have been sold this lie that family and matrimony is antithetical to who they are — for those of us who rarely get to see ourselves reflected in love and happiness .

What could it be ? &quot; &quot; So today , 100 years later , I invite you all on an incredible journey with me , a 37-year-old Yale graduate and professor .
And what if we could value it a different way , so it would actually work ?

After all , the absence of a duty of care within many professions can all too easily amount to accusations of negligence , and that being the case , can we be really comfortable with the thought that we &apos;re in effect being negligent in respect of the health of our own societies and the values that necessarily underpin them ?

Scars that run from the middle of my chest all the way out to my outer torso .
So not the habitual architecture that instills in us the false sort of stability , but an architecture that is full of tension , an architecture that goes beyond itself to reach a human soul and a human heart , and that breaks out of the shackles of habits .
But what happened was that he had to be on medication that , at that time — Diflucan , which in the States is used for yeast infections — cost 30 dollars a pill .
So that kind of motivational tool that is used actually , in and of itself , has a long-term side effect , in that every time we use a technology that uses something like public recognition or status , we &apos;re actually positively endorsing this as a good and normal thing to care about — that way , possibly having a detrimental effect on the long-term psychological well-being of ourselves as a culture .
In fact , what they did to get food was they got in their cars , drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts , came back with a week &apos;s worth of shopping , and wondered what on earth to do with it .
In the commercials , and on the boxes for the Easy-Bake Ovens , Hasbro marketed them specifically to girls .

Saint Obi : I was so fascinated , you know , with those cowboy movies .
And maybe , if we want to be on surer footing , what we really want is a moral framework that will help guide us there , that will tell us what kinds of things are right and wrong in the first place , and how would we know in a given situation what to do .
It wouldn &apos;t create the volume that would fill a large space such as the Cologne Opera House .
Well , I was born with a rare visual condition called achromatopsia , which is total color blindness , so I &apos;ve never seen color , and I don &apos;t know what color looks like , because I come from a grayscale world .

And , using those rules , he was able to say that there are in fact only two objects with six symmetries .
I &apos;m talking about today .
There are so many things to do in this life , and if we could have a simulacrum , a digital doppelgänger of ourselves that helps us process books , do shopping , be our best friends , I believe our mind clones , these digital versions of ourselves , will ultimately be our best friends , and for me personally and Bina personally , we love each other like crazy .
But the market also had bypassed low income farmers , because these systems were both too expensive , and they were constructed for fields that were too large .
We conducted about a dozen focus groups with a broad cross-section of black men , and we learned that for them , being healthy was as much about being perceived as healthy as it was about feeling healthy , and that feeling good went hand in hand with looking good .

However , I will show to you now that we do not need to go to Mars to explore alien worlds .
And so I got myself a job and I was working for a consultancy , and we would get in to these meetings , and these managers would come in , and they would say , &quot; Well , what we &apos;re going to do here is really important , you know . &quot;

We also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of 13 related organisms , and we tried to compare all of those , to see what they had in common .
They are shaping the way we consume .
( Music : &quot; &quot; Rapper &apos;s Delight &quot; &quot; by The Sugarhill Gang ) The MC would improvise lyrics in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies .

Politics has come to resemble a cynical team game played by politicians , while the public has been pushed aside as if sitting on the seats of a stadium in which passion for politics is gradually making room for blindness and desperation .
And as these technologies go forward , you keep seeing this , you keep seeing this , you keep seeing things — 2000 , human genome sequence — and it seems like nothing &apos;s happening , until it does .
We want to avoid death , and the dream of doing that in this body in this world forever is the first and simplest kind of immortality story , and it might at first sound implausible , but actually , almost every culture in human history has had some myth or legend of an elixir of life or a fountain of youth or something that promises to keep us going forever .
And so I think we &apos;re ready to tackle one of the most important questions in neuroscience : how are the brains of men and women different ?
No relationship — gay , straight or anything — that we would regard as remotely healthy or functional looks like that , and yet somehow , you put it on prime time , you slap some makeup on it , throw the glitter on , put it out there as movement , not as text , and we , as a culture , tune in and clap .
And you can see in these central images here , scanning electron micrographs of some of these guys — these are gardens of these bacteria .

The moment you admit to loving someone , you admit to having a lot to lose , and it &apos;s true that these questions do provide a mechanism for getting to know someone quickly , which is also a mechanism for being known , and I think this is the thing that most of us really want from love : to be known , to be seen , to be understood .

They would make a little bit more money ; their standard of living would shift and would get better .
That &apos;s a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do math , I &apos;m sure .
Now the problem with the robots doing this is that they can &apos;t get unstuck , with the material .
These are zebra fish . They &apos;re normally black and silver .

Jabbar : Then what about the rest of us ?
What experiments would you run ?
What I &apos;m going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas .
Now , these people will make guesses , they &apos;ll say things like , &quot; &quot; Why am I getting electricity ?
And their response , of course , was no more than we wanted to stop the genocide and put our troops in harm &apos;s way to do that , nor do we now want to get in the way and pluck genocidaires from camps .

The first of these is natural selection — that &apos;s random mutation and selective retention — along with our basic anatomy and physiology — the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails .
And why can they serve that much ?
I do so many things on this little device .
&quot; &quot; The hour from night to day .
Why do we respond so much to our knowledge of where something comes from ?
Now this noise is so great that society places a huge premium on those of us who can reduce the consequences of noise .
They &apos;re changing the scale of what we can do , and what we &apos;ve developed is something we call FFTT , which is a Creative Commons solution to building a very flexible system of building with these large panels where we tilt up six stories at a time if we want to .
First one is the political system .
As I said to you , this is the first time I &apos;ve shown this in public .
We depend on the fact that audiences , such as yourselves , will make assumptions .

And I think that &apos;s how we got to become human .
So , this talk is going to be about how do we make things and what are the new ways that we &apos;re going to make things in the future .
And what you &apos;re looking at is a paper form in the hand of a Ministry of Health nurse in Indonesia , who is tramping out across the countryside in Indonesia on , I &apos;m sure , a very hot and humid day , and she is going to be knocking on thousands of doors over a period of weeks or months , knocking on the doors and saying , &quot; &quot; Excuse me , we &apos;d like to ask you some questions .

A metaphor will serve here : Where elite mathematicians and statisticians and theorists often serve as architects in the expanding realm of science , the remaining large majority of basic applied scientists , including a large portion of those who could be said to be of the first rank , are the ones who map the terrain , they scout the frontiers , they cut the pathways , they raise the buildings along the way .
So we have this field of science that &apos;s all about slime , and color changes . Check this out .
It &apos;s making a little bit fun of getting older , and , you know , people might like it .

But just because a system is sick doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s dying .
Yet , no amount of diplomacy or institutional design can make up for local failures and the consequences that they have .
You can say a person is lying .

And you &apos;re seeing a lot of things passing through its minds , a lot of self-models that try to explain the relationship between actuation and sensing . It then tries to do a second action that creates the most disagreement among predictions of these alternative models , like a scientist in a lab . Then it does that and tries to explain that , and prune out its self-models .
We know that on Mars and the Moon there are tons of these structures .
