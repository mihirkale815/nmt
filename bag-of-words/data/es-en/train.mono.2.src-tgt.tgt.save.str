they don &apos;t know if they &apos;ll work , and they have no idea what kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash .
we don &apos;t seem to see them .
and with this one campaign as our umbrella , my organization , data , and other groups , have been tapping into the energy and the enthusiasm that &apos;s out there from hollywood into the heartland of america .
that &apos;s just the simulation creating this itself , basically .
i want to become the billionaire ceo , and then i will be happy . &quot; &quot; you &apos;ve got your own variation on that .
subsidiaries of shell and eni paid the nigerian government for the block .
this boy is called sadik .
in time , all of science will come to be a continuum of description , an explanation of networks , of principles and laws .
so is it really fair to objectify them in the way that we do , to share those images ?
his right eye couldn &apos;t see .
and we can take out the physical product , and ready to use , or to , perhaps , assemble into something else .
it also needs — it needs dignity , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s our job to hand those things out .
i &apos;m sure she would &apos;ve said what most of us would &apos;ve said , which is , &quot; &quot; no — can &apos;t you see how busy i am ? &quot; &quot; yet when she had to find seven hours because there is water all over her basement , she found seven hours .
we talked and discovered how prisons and inmates could actually help advance science by helping them complete projects they couldn &apos;t complete on their own , like repopulating endangered species : frogs , butterflies , endangered prairie plants .
i recently joined a field campaign in malaysia . there are others .
these curves for global temperature , atmospheric co2 and sea level were derived from ocean cores and antarctic ice cores , from ocean sediments and snowflakes that piled up year after year over 800,000 years forming a two-mile thick ice sheet .
so basically , if you wanted to generalize , you can demonstrate that as the density increases along the bottom there , that the energy consumed reduces dramatically .
we in public health , we hate child death , so we want less and less and less of child deaths .
&apos;they make certain points . the point is on your head .
it &apos;s a corruption relative to the framers &apos; baseline for this republic .

i hate to break it to you , those aren &apos;t other body parts controlling your behavior .
what if i told you that the two-meter positioning that our current cell phones and our tomtoms give us is pathetic compared to what we could be getting ?
any spoken language that &apos;s used by real people has them .
and you get this strange , escher-like morph from one animal to another .
so , this table i &apos;ve given just to emphasize that i &apos;ve only talked about two examples .
what does that mean ?
because generally in britain if you want to make us happy about something , just tell us we do it better than the germans .

i graduated from university to become a theater director , and that progress is entirely to do with the fact that people i &apos;ll never meet fought for women to have rights , get the vote , get education , have progress .
thank you .
but before i dive into those i want to admit that i am an optimist .
here &apos;s my solution .
i know it has for me .
all big societies that have governments , and where most people are strangers to each other , are inevitably similar to each other and different from tribal societies .
and i also ask myself , does it really work ?
we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement .
in japan , toilets are computers and there &apos;s even hackers who hack them .
i was on a high .
considering this , east germany was a very modern dictatorship .
you see it in many different ways .
we believe that we have found a way to do so , and this is the first time that we &apos;ve shown it in public .
the question of whether disgust ought to influence our moral and political judgments certainly has to be complex , and might depend on exactly what judgments we &apos;re talking about , and as a scientist , we have to conclude sometimes that the scientific method is just ill-equipped to answer these sorts of questions .
and i run a community lab .
let me tell you about mariana popa who worked in redbridge , east london .
of those that don &apos;t abort , atrazine causes impaired mammary , or breast , development in the exposed daughters in utero , so that their breast don &apos;t develop properly .
we &apos;re moving in our homes , in our offices , as we shop and we travel throughout our cities and around our world .
it &apos;s really beautiful , and it conjures up all these various different emotions , but he couldn &apos;t photograph everything , and to tell the story , i had to fill in the gaps , which is now rather daunting , because now i have to recreate back to back what really happened and i had , i &apos;m the only one who could really blow it at that point .
i mean , in the 18th century , in the 18th century you could become an expert on any field of science in an afternoon by going to a library , if you could find the library , right ?
i wanted to know their stories .
just heard that he claimed that you play the piano in an opium den . &quot; &quot; and the father says , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m very sorry . yes , it &apos;s true , i lied .
and so what are those trends ?
you could , if you &apos;re really smart , you could shine a nonlethal laser on the bug before you zap it , and you could listen to the wing beat frequency and you could measure the size .
and then we poured a big foundation for passive solar .
scott adams ran into us and asked us if we wouldn &apos;t help to design the ultimate cubicle for dilbert , which sounded like a fun thing and so we couldn &apos;t pass it up .
and the big challenge was how to understand the meaning of the symptom in this specific cultural context .
now , economists tend to — ( applause ) — economists tend to view the world through their own lenses , which is : this is just a bunch of stupid people .
leibniz , the german mathematician , talked about geomancy in his dissertation called &quot; &quot; de combinatoria . &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; well , instead of using one stroke and two strokes , let &apos;s use a one and a zero , and we can count by powers of two . &quot; &quot; right ? ones and zeros , the binary code .
i probably learned the most about relationships .
i &apos;m from edinburgh . worse news , that &apos;s even edinburgh .
the farm &apos;s incredible .
and i think that moment of completely new thought perhaps creates a freedom that spreads to the rest of other people &apos;s lives .
and i think that &apos;s a wonderful and significant story .
as i went back , every time i went , i found that my neighbors &apos; girls were getting married .
but then they suspected , they thought there was an architect behind it .
and with him , i was able to do a project that was really fantastic .
so i might ask : &quot; &quot; who is it for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; what does it say ? &quot;
( applause ) now i know definitely which one i would choose .
but here &apos;s where it gets tricky .
in india , they &apos;ve got another couple bookmobiles running around .
and so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together because we had to go back .
we have at our fingertips a cornucopia of compelling models , powerful tools , and innovative ideas that can make a meaningful difference in our planet &apos;s future .
because this is where it all really began , isn &apos;t it ?
thank you .
but in the regards to using sustainability as a parameter , as a criteria for fueling systems-based solutions , because as i &apos;ve just demonstrated with these simple products , they &apos;re participating in these major problems .
they are blind from diseases that are either completely curable or preventable .
we let people watch , for the first time in their life , a tv episode from the bbc series &quot; &quot; sherlock , &quot; &quot; while we scanned their brains .
i mean to be able to take off from your home , you &apos;d have to be extremely quiet .
and this was a moment of great pain and trauma because i couldn &apos;t live with it any longer .
we &apos;re used to talking about stars .
but this is what most schools serve .
but the small stuff , what you might call the user interface , is done spectacularly badly .
and we &apos;ve made a wayback machine that you can then go and see old websites kind of the way they were .
i want to tell you how we found that out .
and the reason that it &apos;s proved very successful is it &apos;s private , it &apos;s anonymous , it &apos;s fast , and it &apos;s cheap .
what on earth is wrong with placebos ?
i also make drawings to help people understand things .
and the avian flu is also not a good idea .
the chinese market collapsed , but it rebounded .
and if we just take that and we build from there , then we can go to the next step , which is that if the ocean ain &apos;t happy , ain &apos;t nobody happy .
echinacea , a little antioxidant to get you going .
it &apos;s impressions about blindness that are far more threatening to blind people than the blindness itself .
and there &apos;s some great ideas already in our patch .
so , about the worst kind of breast cancer you can get .
60 homes were destroyed , and 40 were damaged .
it couldn &apos;t be further from the truth for me .
so to do that , what you really need to do , you need to look at the things that the genes are producing and what &apos;s happening after the genetics , and that &apos;s what proteomics is about .
people who have lived in the same location for a long period of time retain a connection to the place where they live that many of the rest of us have lost .
by any economic standard , the demand for art of all forms is skyrocketing , as you can tell from the price of opera tickets , by the number of books sold , by the number of books published , the number of musical titles released , the number of new albums and so on .
honey is a great nutritional substitute for regular sugar because there are different types of sugars in there .
but , lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days , so , it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through .
companies tend to scale up vertically by centralizing operations in big factories and warehouses , but if you want to be agile and deal with immense customer diversity , you need to scale out horizontally using a distributed supply chain with smaller manufacturing and distribution units , like grameen bank has shown .
we need very large archives , and we need excellent specialists .
think of the collective anger in tahrir square , which brought down a dictator .
and i ’ m going to run a little experiment . another little experiment .
and the third one is : do free bed nets discourage future purchase ?
we put it out there .
the surgery was done laparoscopically , so i have just five very small scars on my abdomen , and i had four weeks away from work and went back to doing everything i &apos;d done before without any changes .
but maybe that &apos;s because in architecture school , we don &apos;t really learn how to engage the public in the act of design .
so imagine hundreds of millions of voters casting hundreds of millions of votes , all to be counted correctly and all the things that can possibly go wrong causing all these bad headlines , and you cannot help but feel exhausted at the idea of trying to make elections better .
was it designed around cars or around people ?
except , i even started painting dancers .
( laughter ) i went to visit kitty carlisle hart , and she is 96 , and when i brought her a copy of &quot; &quot; the elements of style , &quot; &quot; she said she would treasure it .
and all this had come from nothing .
we would decide to establish this charter of compassion .
lorna and judith realized that kanner had been as wrong about autism being rare as he had been about parents causing it .
they knew what happened .
i hired guys who paint flats fixed on the sides of garages to do the painting on the building , and they loved it .
just this morning , we announced the open-source fundamental technologies you just saw in the video .
so for instance , what i did when i went to burundi , we &apos;d got tutsi and hutu women together to talk about some of the problems that had taken place in rwanda .
it got this query correct : &quot; &quot; a long , tiresome speech delivered by a frothy pie topping , &quot; &quot; and it quickly responded , &quot; &quot; what is a meringue harangue ? &quot; &quot; and jennings and the other guy didn &apos;t get that .
so , you ’ ll see there ’ s a problem here , something that is illogical .
indeed they would say religion is based on faith or maybe the calculus of pascal &apos;s wager .
without actually having to query them at all , we can get this kind of a structural insight .
how did you then make the decision and assume the responsibilities of running a newspaper , especially in such times of conflict ?
and yet , it feels natural to us now .
someone who has done something like this , however mediocre and throwaway , has tried something , has put something forward in public .
for someone who wants to cure diseases , there is no higher calling .
because not many people are really going to read archimedes in ancient greek , but they should have the chance to do it .
soap opera lesson three : evolution is real .
and on this curve , riding on moore &apos;s law , are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies available to all of us .
my first thought was , &quot; &quot; well , you know , there &apos;s george bush . &quot; &quot; but then i thought , &quot; &quot; why be rude to chimpanzees ? &quot; &quot; i guess there goes my green card .
ca : snowden said two days ago that terrorism has always been what is called in the intelligence world &quot; a cover for action , &quot; that it &apos;s something that , because it invokes such a powerful emotional response in people , it allows the initiation of these programs to achieve powers that an organization like yours couldn &apos;t otherwise have .
well , we &apos;re pretty sure that it &apos;s very small changes in the amount of sunlight reaching antarctica , just caused by natural changes in the orbit of the earth .
and i found myself , after two years there and performing and learning , on the island of bali , on the edge of a crater , gunung batur .
in 2003 , i started a project with computer scientist adam montandon , and the result , with further collaborations with peter kese from slovenia and matias lizana from barcelona , is this electronic eye .
i have occasional meetings with scientists .
so who would think that it was low-fat ?
even in the midst of terrible destruction and death and chaos , i learned how ordinary people could help their neighbors , share food , raise their children , drag someone who &apos;s being sniped at from the middle of the road even though you yourself were endangering your life , helping people get into taxis who were injured to try to take them to hospitals .
and this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences .
if you did , could you please raise your hand ?
i set out to write a compelling economic story , one that had great characters , that no one else was telling , and one that i thought mattered .
and a life that once seemed brief and insignificant revealed itself to be vital , everlasting and relevant .
just last year we realized that you don &apos;t even need to have a robotic device .
tb : good choice.ed : all right , thanks , dr. batiuk .
and it had drastic consequences .
one of those things you just saw flashed before you was a raven drone , the handheld tossed one . for about a thousand dollars , you can build one yourself , equivalent to what the soldiers use in iraq .
it &apos;s got these fishing lures on the bottom . they &apos;re going up and down .
and we should , now , be able to fly in here and have a closer look .
one of the really exciting things , though , is something that came out of the trip that i took to ghana just last month .
we &apos;re advising the burmese opposition , the government of southern sudan , which — you heard it here first — is going to be a new country within the next few years .
so let &apos;s look at what this last century has been to see where we &apos;re going .
this fish , 400 scales — again , it is one uncut square , only folding .
i mean , everything is scaling up very nicely and we &apos;re getting more confident .
and instead , they &apos;ll be planning for the future and starting to build the 22nd century enlightenment .
that &apos;s basically , if you hold two fists together , it &apos;s just slightly larger than the two fists .
and if they don &apos;t know which house to target , they &apos;ve been known to drive this technology around through whole neighborhoods .
quick snapshots of things you might see from a speeding motor scooter , and very slow walking through rome , you might be able to study in more detail some of the wonderful surfaces and whatnot that you come across .
and the only explanation i can have for some of what you &apos;ve been hearing in the last four days is that it arises , in fact , out of a form of love .
your brain works exactly the same way , responding to weight loss by using powerful tools to push your body back to what it considers normal .
each little box is about a billion dollars , and you see that i pay an awful lot of attention to nigeria sitting there in the middle .
they were men who had been contractors , or they had been building houses and they had lost their jobs after the housing boom , and they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support .
we in the lgbt community have gone from being a pathologized and reviled and criminalized group to being seen as part of the great human quest for dignity and equality .
( laughter ) ( applause ) from the drop-down menu , choose the first letter you want to type . ok . ( laughter )
and you can think of this as our satellite view for our map .
it &apos;s the idea of an ever-ever-land , emerging from an ancient civilization , united by a shared history , but sustained , above all , by pluralist democracy .
why don &apos;t you advise their government on their diplomacy ? &quot; &quot; and the kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service .
now in the top 10 cities in the u.s.
if you ask , what is the big difference between women and men physiologically ?
see any common themes ? principles ?
if , however , as in pasadena , every lane is a bike lane , then no lane is a bike lane .
we need to see how we can help those societies move from political coalitions , loosely based political coalitions , to civilizational coalitions that are working for the ideals and narratives of the democratic culture on the ground .
the first is , i think we need to question this idea that architecture is about making buildings .
stop trying to be good people .
and look at this whole range of cycle-based innovations : cycle that &apos;s a sprayer , cycle that generates energy from the shocks on the road .
so that was the reason for the project .
with my eyes shut . ha-ha .
these freckles are called sunspots , and they are just one of the manifestations of the sun &apos;s magnetic field .
so this shows the average relationship between gdp and social progress .
hold your phones up , hold your phones up !
if you do , would you mind if i timed how long it took you to walk down that hallway ?
sometimes we make food , too .
and that &apos;s going to pose an enormous problem .
before we were meant to travel , my mom came home one day , and said , &quot; we &apos;re going on a little holiday , a little trip . &quot;
so , this is a view of what humans are .
and so that &apos;s what we &apos;ll do today .
but after this , we have empirical evidence that 82 percent , on average , among all these villages — 1,200 villages have completed it — waterborne diseases have come down 82 percent .
so it was the fall of 1902 , and president theodore roosevelt needed a little break from the white house , so he took a train to mississippi to do a little black bear hunting outside of a town called smedes .
and we can use those lessons to craft our own life stories .
how do you get from trauma to growth ?
we filed the patent for her , the national innovation foundation .
so , people have commented on how , &quot; &quot; well , you know , you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of pandora . &quot; &quot; to me , it was more of a fundamental way of doing business , the process itself , that changed as a result of that .
i was adopted by the bishop of the episcopal diocese during the riots , and he donated a row house . and in that row house i started manchester craftsmen &apos;s guild , and i learned very quickly that wherever there are episcopalians , there &apos;s money in very close proximity .
now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic .
but it was like sex , you didn &apos;t have to be told .
and yet one more tap , and you &apos;d be &quot; &quot; liking &quot; &quot; auntie glenda on facebook .
and so i just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there , but you can fill in whatever you want . this is not a forecast .
and if nasa doesn &apos;t do it , china might , or somebody in this room might write a big check .
and what we know is that it &apos;s as if the bees have caught a flu .
see , second time for the same player .
all these women sitting at one table from eight , nine countries , all chatting to each other , not understanding a word , because they &apos;re all speaking a different language .
when we think about how we address problems in this country , we often start from a place of trickle-down justice .
arabs were saving jews . jews were saving arabs .
that &apos;s always been the harder problem when it comes to fighting wars .
and we know money is the root of all evil , but it didn &apos;t actually stop evil from happening in cambodia , in fact .
and it is his spirit and his optimism that is in my dna .
there were parades on veteran &apos;s day — there wasn &apos;t a president &apos;s day .
this is an image of me and my daughter holding the israeli flag .
we should have been , because it made a lot of smoke and it made a lot of noise , and it was powerful , you know .
the big plan was to ask him for a 1,000,000-dollar loan .
i mean , what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her ?
now , in fact , they couldn &apos;t do it for a lot of reasons today .
it &apos;s also fair to say that because it takes so many countries to agree to issue these extra sdrs , it &apos;s highly unlikely that money printing would get out of control .
it often takes a generation to accomplish , but it also requires us , today &apos;s generation , to take responsibility and to learn the right lessons about leadership , diplomacy and institutional design , so that the child soldiers of today can become the children of tomorrow .
so i &apos;m beginning to suspect that our specialization is beginning to impede our progress at best , and at worst , is leading us astray .
and no matter what i say , you cannot untie me from the mast .
it looks like this . this is the fifth prototype . it &apos;s not quite done .
ignore the instructions , that &apos;s what the government has to put in there to confuse you , i &apos;m sure .
we said , oh , kindergarten seems like a good place .
this is where it all comes from , and where these farmers who actually , ten thousand years ago , put us on the road of bread .
or — think about it — that 60,000 dollars is more than what it costs to send one person to harvard as well .
and we &apos;re also joined by brent lawson from lawson frisk securities .
we have nestlé creating nespresso , we have lego going into animated films , toyota creating the hybrids , unilever pushing into sustainability — there are lots of examples , and the benefits are huge .
we show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the united states and internationally .
i &apos;d grown five inches and done some 20,000 pushups in eight months , and the night before the crash , i delighted in my new body , playing basketball with friends into the wee hours of a may morning .
that &apos;s the idea of creativity .
and we have 26 elephants here , and our research is focused on the evolution of intelligence with elephants , but our foundation think elephants is focused on bringing elephants into classrooms around the world virtually like this and showing people how incredible these animals are .
a pattern is emerging and it says a lot more about us than it does about them .
and i went back to the u.n. for another couple of years .
and each one of these forces split the world , tore the world apart , divided the world .
we use over five billion tons of coal , 30 billion-plus barrels of oil — that &apos;s a hundred million barrels a day .
we don &apos;t believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data , and i do understand that , i think we all do .
we make sure that the telemedicine platform gives access to expert medical specialists anywhere in the world , just by a click of the button .
i know you did because half of americans do every day .
i believe that what &apos;s mostly missing for nonviolence to grow is not for palestinians to start adopting nonviolence , but for us to start paying attention to those who already are .
so instead of having starch , which is the food of plants , it takes something rather similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate that it &apos;s burning fat , metabolizing , about the rate of a small cat .
( music ) i &apos;m a video game addict , and it &apos;s not because of a certain number of hours i have spent playing , or nights i have gone without sleep to finish the next level .
and i said , &quot; &quot; yes , i have a job . i write and illustrate children &apos;s books . &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; well , who pays you for that ? &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; no one , no one , no one just yet .
it was a gray november day , and i was overdue .
we used it in the 19th century to build art museums .
again , you can get the playback and personal contribution .
( applause ) they do lots of inconsistent things .
this is just an excerpt from one of those letters : &quot; &quot; my 12 year-old son has autism , and has had a terrible time with math .
the first time i met min , she had just turned 18 and quit her first job on the assembly line of an electronics factory .
and the stories that were captured of his life make up one of the crown jewels of histories , of human-lived experiences filled with ex-slaves .
i mean , it goes on in our private lives , too , every single day .
it &apos;s early , but i &apos;ve already , i &apos;ve got some lined up .
what can we do about this ? what are the solutions ?
most students think that it &apos;s boring or unwelcoming , so i have always designed projects following three principles .
ca : that &apos;s good .
now i don &apos;t expect every kid to be a farmer , but i expect you to read about it , write about it , blog about it , offer outstanding customer service .
you create your own reality , and you believe it .

that &apos;s why today we can use the files to get a better understanding of how a surveillance state functions .
actually , this was the first time i felt applause on the vest .
in a country of only seven million people , one and a half million were murdered by their own leaders , their bodies piled in the mass graves of the killing fields .
it &apos;s a horrific story . someone took a bottle of tylenol , put poison in it , closed it up , put it back on the shelf .
because we have real problems .
patient capital requires that we have incredible tolerance for risk , a long time horizon in terms of allowing those entrepreneurs time to experiment , to use the market as the best listening device that we have , and the expectation of below-market returns , but outsized social impact .
he wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my hopes and dreams .
can you come back next year and remind us again ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) some people say 9 / 11 heals the rift — jerks the long-term transformation gurus out of their 30,000 foot view of history , drags them down in to the muck and says , &quot; &quot; you want a networked opponent ?
here &apos;s our winner of the soprano solo .
amazing possibility .
and we get a lot of that .
so fine , we have a body clock , and it turns out that it &apos;s incredibly important in our lives .
removing the salts from water — particularly seawater — through reverse osmosis is a critical technique for countries who do not have access to clean drinking water around the globe .
i think that number &apos;s probably going to go up .
your world is ours . you — mt : as i was saying , besides the faces and bodies we give our robots , we cannot read their intentions , and that makes us nervous .
so i went searching when i started in this game to convince myself that there was any degree of plausibility to this whole crazy story .
so there are other examples , i &apos;m sure there are more to come .
if i show you 600 magazines and i divide them up into 10 categories , versus i show you 400 magazines and divide them up into 20 categories , you believe that i have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if i gave you the 400 than if i gave you the 600 .
the daf-2 hormone receptor is very similar to the receptor for the hormone insulin and igf-1 .
they constantly use the argument to devalue rap and modern pop , and these arguments completely miss the point , because the dam has burst .

not just the way we think about the world , but the way we are — our very biology .
first off , scientists have egos , and scientists like to name dinosaurs .
buckminster fuller was the kind of green guru — again , a word that had not been coined .
it allows us as owners to have other options .
the bear is a helpless victim tied to a tree , and the president of the united states decided to show it some mercy .
we call this comic book &quot; &quot; yes is more , &quot; &quot; which is obviously a sort of evolution of the ideas of some of our heroes .

so in that picture , the x and the w are known , and the y is the unknown .
bg : if you project yourself — having done the research and having tried to get permission to start the trials , if you project yourself out in time , how many years before somebody gets into a hospital and this therapy is available ?

and i cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see .

so while i &apos;m talking to you , the seats you are sitting on are currently emitting some invisible and odorless toxic gas . sorry for that . ( laughter ) so you are currently breathing formaldehyde .

it &apos;s strong and resilient .
video : whoa ! ( laughter ) al gore : she &apos;s okay . the question is whether we will be .
i was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago .
and over time — quite rapidly actually , in a number of hours — we can build a physical product , ready to take out of the machine and use .

in fact , it appeared in a porno comic book , which is the slide on the right .
and if i succeed in doing that , maybe you would go back with the thought that you could build on , and perhaps help me do my work .
so i &apos;m announcing today the start of a new organization , or a new fund within the feed foundation , called the 30 project .
in countries where these people have no choice but to work in those fields , they simply do it and risk it .
why would we want to do it robotically ?
we can do things that rovers can &apos;t do and landers can &apos;t do : we can fly above mountains , volcanoes , impact craters ; we fly over valleys ; we can fly over surface magnetism , the polar caps , subsurface water ; and we can search for life on mars .
one is the question of education .
and one of the things that i think is important is that we have to get away from this idea of designing the machines manually , but actually let them evolve and learn , like children , and perhaps that &apos;s the way we &apos;ll get there . thank you .
this production was directed by south african artist and theater director , william kentridge .

we need human cells , but we need to find a way to keep them happy outside the body .
you see , when we speak of the big bang , we often have an image of a kind of cosmic explosion that created our universe and set space rushing outward .
i also think it &apos;s not that unlikely that governments might start taking an interest in genetic modification .
the first one , body-to-body transfer , yeah , with an outside mental architecture that i work with that they hold memory with for me .
they &apos;re flying and flashing their hearts out .
now we &apos;re not here for that long anyway , but to spend almost half of our life lost in thought and potentially quite unhappy , i don &apos;t know , it just kind of seems tragic , actually , especially when there &apos;s something we can do about it , when there &apos;s a positive , practical , achievable , scientifically proven technique which allows our mind to be more healthy , to be more mindful and less distracted .
and , over time , we started understanding and systematically researching what this tinkering ecosystem is about , because that is something that &apos;s happening not just in one street corner in mumbai .
we &apos;re not all in the same boat , and that means nobody &apos;s willing to sacrifice for the common good .
this time it &apos;s sending the same message and link .

the motivational component of compassion creates ambition for greater good .
and putting that data together — you can see the looting pits marked here .
well , one or two brave souls .
and when we are able to do that , what happens ?
i think we can do that in cambridge , &quot; &quot; brought it to cambridge and they started — two women — robin chase being the other person who started it .
now , we &apos;ve seen this can work with all forms of art — drawing , painting , collage — but what seems to have the most impact is mask-making .
i thought everybody had a job like that .
this is on the way home .

you talk about what you want .
not just where you attach a micro-controller to the end point , but that the structure and the mechanisms are the logic , are the computers .
the point about democracy is not instrumental .

these people actually believe — and they have no contact among them , no common language or anything , so it &apos;s not an idea that spread , it &apos;s an idea that &apos;s arisen around the world — they believe that a fetus is literally made of accumulated semen .
now we believe that spacetime and objects are the nature of reality as it is .
because fielders are successful 90 to 95 percent of the time .

it would hardly do to eat your baby or your lover .
and he &apos;s not the only one in the world .
oxygen concentrators are very old technology . what is new , and what we will have in a few months , i hope , is that ability to use this same renewable energy system to provide and produce oxygen on site . zeolite — it &apos;s not new — zeolite removes nitrogen from air and nitrogen is 78 percent of air .
they have to deal with things like toxins and pharmaceuticals that are flushed out into the ocean , and maybe even affecting their reproduction .
and that &apos;s kind of what has been the spirit of what we are doing .
he went around once , he went around twice , he went around thrice .

what percentage lived in a house with a bomb shelter ?
( chanting ) jennifer : a soldier walked onto the road , asking where we &apos;d been .
we have to address problems at the root , and when you deal with what &apos;s happening in black communities , it creates an effervescence , right ?
and it was all the people who lived in those homes , were the ones that were actually taking it apart and working , and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart .

dd : this is something i call &quot; &quot; swinging in the rain . &quot; &quot; and you can barely see it , but it &apos;s — a controller at top cycles the water to fall just before and after you pass through the bottom of the arc .
it felt as if my brain was trying to kill me , and then , being afraid of being afraid consumed all of my thoughts .

so , here we are , a week after the olympics and down at atlanta , and i &apos;m just blown away by the fact that just a year ago , i got out on a gravel track and couldn &apos;t run 50 meters .

and indeed , i was very far from the mark .
why ? because in compassion , when we feel with the other , we dethrone ourselves from the center of our world and we put another person there . and once we get rid of ego , then we &apos;re ready to see the divine .
but now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess .
how can we understand what makes some societies more fragile than other societies ? the problem is obviously relevant to our situation today , because today as well , there are some societies that have already collapsed , such as somalia and rwanda and the former yugoslavia . there are also societies today that may be close to collapse , such as nepal , indonesia and columbia .
they &apos;re taking information from our planet at very critical places like antarctica and the poles .

most of our current voters and politicians have no personal experience of any of those things , but millions of older americans do .
this is the sort of 3d data that a machine will read .
and it &apos;s through the sharing that people get tactics of how to take care of themselves , how to disclose how to take medicines .
and even that was considered outrageous at the time .
and then what happens is , when they put the marshmallow on the top , they run out of time and what happens ?
neither have i provided electricity to my village through sheer ingenuity .
i teach courses in physical computing and wearable electronics .
( laughter ) you see , psychokinesis is the paranormal influence of the mind on physical events and processes .
( video ) voice : onicha , off to school with your brother .

everybody else at the time of google , more or less , was trying to be a portal .
it initially started off with me stacking these things , bunches of them , and then playing with the sense of space , of filling in the space . and then it started changing , and become folding on themselves .
now these are examples of new orleans rebuilding in this way , but better if others act proactively with these changes in mind .

the child &apos;s symptoms begin with mild fever , headache , muscle pains , followed by vomiting and diarrhea , then bleeding from the mouth , nose and gums .
this — i &apos;ve shown you sea floor — but so the goal here is real time interaction with the oceans from anywhere on earth .
instead of being the sole guardian of information , be a facilitator to all this information .
they gave us endotracheal aspirate — you know , a little fluid from the throat , from this tube that they got down there — and they gave us this .

they get fit together , and then they compete .
and i &apos;d heard this before as well .
in india it was just impossible to paste .

if we know what it takes to have a healthcare system rather than a sick-care system , why don &apos;t we just do it ?

i have always wanted to travel back in time to an era where maps were mostly blank or they read , &quot; &quot; there be dragons . &quot; &quot; and today , the closest i &apos;ve come is visiting remote atolls in the western indian ocean .
so a fair criticism — is what it is — of second life today is that it &apos;s more like the wild west than it is like rome , from a cultural standpoint .
older people really wanted to leave the european union .
so , imagine we &apos;re in the middle of america .
i made a film that was impossible to make , but i didn &apos;t know it was impossible , and that &apos;s how i was able to do it .
people are now confident to bring — if your people in the diaspora bring their money back , it shows other people that , look , there is emerging confidence in your country .
( laughter ) we grew up playing a bunch of , we played by ear and i think that &apos;s important for us because we were not really exposed to a lot of different styles of music .
but this last time , just coming round , right now , suddenly , there &apos;d be huge changes in the environment , in the concentration of people , and it was just unbelievable , the amount of — all the change in it .

and one of my heroes , aphex twin , famously hid in dark corners of clubs .
now , the conceptual issues are truly profound when you talk about creativity and ownership and , let me tell you , we don &apos;t want to leave this just to lawyers to figure out .
i was fortunate also , to meet the man who &apos;s sitting on the bed , though i gave him hair over here and he doesn &apos;t have hair .
i can talk to you over it without worrying about what we in fact now know is happening , without worrying about the fact that not only will surveillance be happening but it &apos;ll be done by people who may abuse the data .
and , kind of as a way of surviving , i would go into my own very personal space , and i would make things .

i had a family friend who for years used to call my girlfriend my lover .
and , as well , as of efficacy , agency .
they were doing fine .
so my breakfast , my lunch , i donate it to a charity that i founded because we want to build a school in sudan .

it &apos;s easy to forget that because of its short life , the internet has actually changed many times over the last 30 years or so .
i would like break the walls of ignorance between east and west — no , not the soft option that we have discussed before , but rather the soft power that joseph nye has spoken about before .
but as soon as i get to a place of real quiet , i realize that it &apos;s only by going there that i &apos;ll have anything fresh or creative or joyful to share with my wife or bosses or friends .

during the 1918 flu pandemic 50 million people died .
so , parabiosis is done in mice by surgically connecting the two mice together , and that leads then to a shared blood system , where we can now ask , &quot; &quot; how does the old brain get influenced by exposure to the young blood ? &quot; &quot; and for this purpose , we use young mice that are an equivalency of 20-year-old people , and old mice that are roughly 65 years old in human years .
no one to figure out what tools should be used .
the demands of modern institutional thinking is coming in .
but i &apos;m not ashamed of my self .
she goes back to reading her book , which is unfortunately titled &quot; &quot; rape . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so she &apos;s noticed the unusual thing , but she &apos;s gone back to her normal life .

he asked the question , if i take that material , which is a natural material that usually induces healing in the small intestine , and i place it somewhere else on a person &apos;s body , would it give a tissue-specific response , or would it make small intestine if i tried to make a new ear ?
it &apos;s true .
but you probably don &apos;t know that much about james watt .
and then he started clapping .
because we are reactive to the heightened venom of the political debate , you get governments that have an us-versus-them mentality , tiny groups of people making decisions .
but not too long ago , i came upon this on the web .
change happens slowly .
and that if we don &apos;t do that , the antithesis , although we &apos;ve heard otherwise , is we &apos;re really going to become extinct , because we &apos;re feeding our children to death .
so are we all .
and isn &apos;t it that strange moment when you publish your design ?
so if you think from the perspective of early metastatic cancer cells as they &apos;re out searching around for the resources that they need , if those resources are clustered , they &apos;re likely to use interactions for recruitment , and if we can figure out how cancer cells are recruiting , then maybe we could set traps to catch them before they become established .
so we need to think about , as was spoken earlier , the traditional african methods for doing self-organization .
the governments that are making the most progress are the governments that have found ways to enable shared value in business rather than see government as the only player that has to call the shots .
&quot; hello world , hello berlin , hello nsa , hello gchq . &quot;
and then this funny thing happened .
even more exciting .
i want to say that i think the powers that be know that empire-building is actually — that feelings get in the way of empire-building .
for most of the past 114 years , everyone , including scientists , mistakenly confused alzheimer &apos;s with aging .
however , the inequalities that exist between richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding pose a real risk for exploitation , especially in the context of externally-funded research .
this is the story of my brother .
so let me talk a little bit about why we need to do that , because our global commons is under attack in a variety of ways , and none of the sources of threat to the global commons will be solved by building walls .
there &apos;s a lot to talk about in this chart .
there &apos;s no suggestion of a relationship there .
i &apos;m going to have a sandwich for lunch .
i had other dreams , not necessarily practical ones , but at the age of eight , i was bequeathed a guitar .
here &apos;s a clue .
and it takes weeks to perform our integrations .
no one &apos;s going to notice those split lines and changes .
institutions hate being told they &apos;re obstacles .
( laughter ) but here &apos;s how i think i like to make change , and that is in making connections .
so i grab the dove , and for the second time i send her in the air .
it means it gets filled with hot air .
it &apos;s the same with a wheat field , it &apos;s the same with a rice field .

one is that they &apos;re highly prevalent .
those flags represented the countries from which my team came from .
it &apos;s full of us , it &apos;s full of our stuff , full of our waste , full of our demands .
generally a duty of care arises when one individual or a group of individuals undertakes an activity which has the potential to cause harm to another , either physically , mentally or economically .
but instead the entire team creates a shared mental model that they can all agree on and move forward on .
and all of the items on it are unremarkable .
what &apos;s special about it ?
( laughter ) and i expect to speak in the first session of the 39th ted india .
this doesn &apos;t bother me so much , that the underlying darwinian rationale of compassion is kind of self-serving at the genetic level .
but most of us , i think , accept some small role for the state to enforce a duty of care , and the key word here is reasonable .
now , you don &apos;t see these devices as add-ons for phones yet , but students and engineers around the world have attached atmospheric sensors to bicycles and handheld computers and cheap robots and the backs of pigeons — that being a project that &apos;s actually underway right now at u.c. irvine , using bird-mounted sensors as a way of measuring smog-forming pollution .
and the one in mono , by the way , he used the pedal , and as he got older , he said , &quot; &quot; no , no , wait a minute .
( laughter ) now , i think this is totally obvious , but the very obviousness of it raises what is for me an incredibly profound question .
she worried that the violence we witnessed would overtake our lives ; that our poverty meant that the neighbors with whom we lived and shared space would harm us .
disc1 is a gene that &apos;s deleted in schizophrenia .
i love to cook , i hosted many dinner parties , and in return , people invited me to their dinner parties , and to their barbecues , and to their pool parties , and to their birthday parties .
it &apos;s a bit suspicious isn &apos;t it ? there is two answers to the question so far , zero and one .
and it &apos;s sort of one of the other groups of people who pay a price for us .
and based on my prior sighted experience , it sounds like a pretty cool city , whether you &apos;re blind , whether you have a disability , or you haven &apos;t quite found yours yet .
and everybody ran up to me .
but the types of results that can be produced are undeniable .
so , three years ago , i got together with some friends of mine who had similar aspirations and we founded genspace .
she didn &apos;t recognize me — there was no recognition whatsoever .
the level is dropping , rather like the aral sea .
ruby taught me that you &apos;re not supposed to be afraid of the bugs under your bed .
the space between buildings will be well-balanced between people and cars .
the most important thing is to be a mensch . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) thank you . ( applause ) ( applause )
but are they really ?
with income down there and child mortality .
the dalai lama often states that compassion is his best friend .
by the way , this is something that really bothers me .
( laughter ) but not to create the engineering colleges .
i used a gps to get here today , and this is my hometown .
he &apos;s an austrian school economist who was first active in the first half of the 20th century in vienna .
in fact , it &apos;s hard .
and people say , &quot; &quot; oh , well , you &apos;ve launched this thing , and it &apos;s radioactive , into space , and what about accidents ? &quot; &quot; but we launch plutonium batteries all the time .
so if you look at the green data points , which is air that &apos;s outside , you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s a large amount of microbial diversity , or variety of microbial types .
so the one thing , though , that i want you to remember about this is that these patterns of interactions are something that you &apos;d expect to be closely connected to colony size .
this is a left-in , right-out , left-in , center-out and tie .
in our system , whether you &apos;re detained or free , pending trial is not a matter of how dangerous you are or how much of a flight risk you pose .
and yet i see it as something that &apos;s just as basic for survival — long term — as learning some of the basic things about public health .
and lo and behold , we found that we could do it .
work with advice that works for your family .
in your time , scientists thought humans could replace organs and extend life for hundreds of years .
it is really in this sense of discovery that i have a new set of questions that i &apos;m asking .
and i had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it .
it &apos;s called crispr-cas9 .
i said , &quot; &quot; tell me about the men and women who painted these . &quot; &quot; and he looked at me absolutely askance , and he said , &quot; women didn &apos;t paint these pictures . &quot;
i gave a talk like this in london a while back about this point . i said , as i say to all of you , i &apos;m on facebook . friend me .
why isn &apos;t the title of the show , &apos; a black woman got the job ? &apos; or &apos; a black woman got a job ? &apos; &quot; &quot; because without confronting men &apos;s sense of entitlement , i don &apos;t think we &apos;ll ever understand why so many men resist gender equality .
very soon , the same systems that we use today to bring music and entertainment and gps information into our vehicles are going to be used to create a smart vehicle network .
so even though you are blind , you can put your hand over it , you can see the lanes of the road and obstacles .
we use four million cups a day on airline flights , and virtually none of them are reused or recycled .
i mean , people — pamela anderson has more prosthetic in her body than i do .
i had closed all the curtains in the apartment , so in the middle of the day the apartment was in near total darkness .
so , for example , the middle line there , 0.1 watts per square meter , is the energy consumption per unit area of saudi arabia , norway , mexico in purple , and bangladesh 15 years ago .
and two years after this photo was taken , she passed away , and i attended her wake , and nothing could have prepared me for what i saw there , because next to her casket was this painting , and her husband told me it meant so much to her that i had acknowledged her hard work , i had validated what she did .
the state still matters .
as usual , there &apos;s a dozen kids there waiting to get picked up , but this time , the children &apos;s faces look weirdly similar , and you can &apos;t figure out which child is yours .
for instance , the tunnel diode , a component used in electronics , works thanks to the wonders of quantum tunneling .
try to imagine what the surface of titan might look like .
and these guys paint humongous paintings , and they look really good .
and it exists with the educated urban class , also .
and the way it works is , it comes from the southwest .
( applause ) bruno giussani : harry , even if you just said the science may not have some answers , i would like to ask you a couple of questions , and the first is : building something like the lhc is a generational project .
one of the very interesting facts is that , in addition , we find that even once we hold constant , statistically , the effect of your own education , the education of everyone else in your metropolitan area also affects your wages .
you can lead a good , ethical life , but some bad phraseology in a tweet can overwhelm it all , become a clue to your secret inner evil .
you may recognize a couple of the miners there .
now , take into account the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe , ok , a three-dimensional space .
now , i &apos;m not predicting 200 years of chaos as a result of this . 50 .
and west antarctica cropped up on top some under-sea islands , is particularly rapid in its melting .
relative to the universe , it &apos;s just up the road .
but we have to recognize that we have those limitations .
is all of our brain going to start to shrink and atrophy like that ?
i &apos;ve actually eaten seven of those baskets and they &apos;re very good .
( applause ) and so the significance is that we have now developed this model that is helping us , not only finally with evaluation , assessing what works .
david hockney talks about how the appreciation of this very glamorous painting is heightened if you think about the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash , which only took a fraction of a second to happen .
my best man , i told him he could surprise me , and he thought this would be hilarious , but this is not something .
it &apos;s decades old , but it &apos;s becoming very trendy among police forces around the planet lately , it seems , and according to my experience as a non-voluntary breather of it , tear gas has two main but quite opposite effects .
and the town has really embraced it .
and the corollary , of course , is that any further changes that could significantly change the substrate of thinking could have potentially enormous consequences .
let &apos;s continue with that same excerpt .
gh : well , one of the glorious things that &apos;s starting to happen now is that the collapse of these systems and the consequences are becoming obvious .
so i had to launch a very expensive salvage operation and then wait another nine months before i could get back out onto the ocean again .
when the books were first published , i invited her to the book launch party , and in front of everyone there , everyone she had fed over the years , i gave her a piece of artwork and some books .
i just wanted you to know that .
but in niger , for example , less than seven percent of the children are breastfed for the first six months of life , exclusively .
( laughter ) two letters , an l and an o , now a worldwide force .
so just to let you see what is the code of life .
simple designs for infection control had not been thought about , and people had died because of it .
you know , what i do is write for children , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most widely read children &apos;s author , in fact .
in other words , if democracy is to be rebuilt , is to become again vigorous and vibrant , it is necessary not just for the public to learn to trust their politicians , but for the politicians to learn to trust the public .
and i &apos;m going to show you a sample of the piece , &quot; from conception to birth . &quot;
this suggests to me that life causing these mass extinctions because it did is inherently anti-gaian .
that &apos;s not their role ; they &apos;re supposed to read what we write .
they include exploration , which is about going for quantity ; building , and thinking with your hands ; and role-play , where acting it out helps us both to have more empathy for the situations in which we ’ re designing , and to create services and experiences that are seamless and authentic .
i don &apos;t want to take you through the gory details , i just want to tell you about some of the amazing features of this product .
people are learning more things about it .
you have to give to receive .
well , you know , i think the answer is very simple : working with nature , working with this tool set that we now understand , is the next step in humankind &apos;s evolution .
now , the advantage of studying our own galaxy is it &apos;s simply the closest example of the center of a galaxy that we &apos;re ever going to have , because the next closest galaxy is 100 times further away .
it means that violence , the rule of warriors and despotic chiefs , the conditions of camps and warfare , of riot and tyranny , give place to parliaments where laws are made , and independent courts of justice in which over long periods those laws are maintained .
this is in portland . that is an actual development .
it &apos;s beginning to grow tremendously .
it &apos;s the greenest building in the world .
she shows us , trains us how to do and how to be better &#91; people &#93; and how to do long hours in surgery — 300 patients per day , 10 , 20 surgeries , and still you have to manage the camp — that &apos;s how she trains us .
what is that number ? half a billion ? a billion ? what is that number ?
that &apos;s walking abraham &apos;s path .
but that ’ s not really true : you can be a serious professional adult and , at times , be playful .
that can actually hardly be seen from the canal tours .
you can do that quite fast .
this is a refrigerator factory , churning out airplanes for world war ii .
imagine : many of these problems could be prevented if these babies were just kept warm .
( applause ) thank you . thank you . thank you .
wonderful job onstage .
farmers are facing challenges of drought from asia to africa , from australia to oklahoma , while heat waves linked with climate change have killed tens of thousands of people in western europe in 2003 , and again in russia in 2010 .
and in the ideal case , the hypothesis isn &apos;t just an idea : ideally , it is a law of nature .
this is how it looks like in practice . we have this grass we want to get rid of .
the crisis is almost certainly deepening around us .
i don &apos;t belong in this street .
hourly simulations show that largely or wholly renewable grids can deliver highly reliable power when they &apos;re forecasted , integrated and diversified by both type and location .
in fact , i &apos;d go so far as to say , if you don &apos;t already have a nerd in your life , you should get one .
and i &apos;m going to try and show that at the end , and the suspense will be as much mine if it works .
in short , can we carve out a future which is peaceful and mutually prosperous , or are we looking at a great challenge of war or peace ?
so i was told about 10 years ago that this would never happen , that this was close to impossible .
here is the critical difference between these : lolcats is communal value .
a much more powerful approach to public health — imagine what might be possible .
rb : dropping in for tea .
let &apos;s fast-forward just 15 years from now .
( applause ) chris anderson : sendhil , thank you so much .
it &apos;s completely mechanical , again , a printer .
it &apos;s transparent with blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz of a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live their lives in public .
a health crisis makes people do all sorts of risky things , like quitting a job or jumping out of an airplane and , in the case of my sister , saying &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; to several therapy sessions , during which we got down to the marrow .
( applause ) thank you .
a lot of things are going through your head .
we didn &apos;t have the luxury of pre-recorded samples of speech for those born with speech disorder .
changes the way medicine works .
we do still use fortran .
it &apos;s just actually — you see , this is folding up — it &apos;s behind the seat .
you now have control over your own destiny .
speaking of gandhi , he was a recovering lawyer , as i &apos;ve heard the term , and he was called to a greater cause , something that mattered to him , he couldn &apos;t not do .
now , four years ago , chris lost his job , unfortunately , as an art buyer at macy &apos;s , and like so many people , he struggled to find a new one during the recession .
voice 1 : it &apos;s coming again . voice 2 : new wave ?
they develop science that makes it easier and easier to do .
so once again , we see that these two graphs are actually saying the same thing .
so crisis leading into opportunities .
but that is expensive .
we &apos;re going to do something that in recent years we &apos;ve started : take a mucus sample .
friendship , altruism , compassion , service – all the perennial truths that we talked about that are part of all religion and all cultures — once you stop trying to see the differences , these are the things in our own self-interest , because they free us from our suffering and from disease .
but look , i can prove to you that they &apos;re straight because i can take any one of these lines , and i can fold along it .
so , a couple spreads from the book : here mcluhan says , &quot; the new media are not bridges between man and nature ; they are nature . &quot;
( laughter ) but when we dug deeper , we didn &apos;t find corruption in the classic sense : slimy gangsters lurking in the darkness , waiting to grease the palms of their friends .
how could i share my sense of rome , my understanding of rome ?
well , when he was oil minister , he awarded an oil block now worth over a billion dollars to a company that , guess what , yeah , he was the hidden owner of .
but in my first 25 years of career , i had a bunch of different experiences .
because what the facts are telling us is that the long , slow journey , humanity &apos;s long , slow journey of equality , is actually speeding up .
and early in the morning , i went into the ward .
karstic regions cover almost 20 percent of the continents &apos; surface , and we know actually that speleologists in the last 50 years have explored roughly 30,000 kilometers of cave passages around the world , which is a big number .
wk : yeah . i test .
our democracies are weakened in the global economy with players that can evade laws , evade taxes , evade environmental or labor standards .
and we ’ re only just beginning to grasp it .
the original version of the story , the one that i tried last summer , that pairs the personal questions with four minutes of eye contact , was referenced in this article , but unfortunately it was never published .
in contrast , i took a plate with six one-dollar bills , and i left those plates in the same refrigerators .
so , as a last thought , i think that integrating information to everyday objects will not only help us to get rid of the digital divide , the gap between these two worlds , but will also help us , in some way , to stay human , to be more connected to our physical world .
i was born in switzerland and raised in ghana , west africa .
should &apos;ve been a dancer .
maybe sometime in the future , we will .
how about counting every calorie ?
and indeed , unfortunately , if you navigate by needs you get a very unfocused agenda , because in these situations , needs are everywhere , but the capacity to implement change is very limited .
at the time , what they thought distinguished science was a radical idea about things unseen , known as empiricism .
women used to get really debilitating surgeries to excise all of the axillary lymph nodes .
and this is how the tamper-proof drug industry was invented .
they &apos;re carrying instruments that are actually taking data down to 2,000 meters .
so now , i started from the big problem , and i couldn &apos;t answer it .
and there the simple version of the message is it &apos;s moving from west to east .
so you put human growth hormone in , the person grows taller , or you put x in and the person gets fatter or loses metabolism or does a whole series of things , but you &apos;re altering the functions in a fundamental way .

and when they began on this corner and wrapped around the entire hospital , they were so good at putting these stones together , they asked us if they could take down the original wall and rebuild it .
( laughter ) but as you &apos;re thinking about this , one of the interesting things is how small these mutations are and where they take place .
car-sharing was actually invented in europe .

we built our first prototype drones in switzerland .
eythor bender : we are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device , this new exoskeleton this year .
if we go down the small pathway a little bit farther , we &apos;re entering the era of nanomedicine , the ability to make devices super small to the point where we can design red blood cells or microrobots that will monitor our blood system or immune system , or even those that might clear out the clots from our arteries .
so this is a pattern that assumes we &apos;re all in this together .

this particular idea , however — although we don &apos;t yet know whether it &apos;s right or wrong , and at the end i &apos;ll discuss experiments which , in the next few years , may tell us whether it &apos;s right or wrong — this idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century and continues to inform a lot of cutting-edge research .
i always get goosebumps every time i see it .
it &apos;s not in the abstract ; it &apos;s the interaction with the environment .
the fact that they &apos;re not right in front of us , the fact , of course , that they &apos;re of a different nationality or race , none of that seems morally relevant to me .

we have demonstrated that our model works .
but you go to rwanda — a very small country — 8,000 mothers with hiv who are pregnant .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about .
any of one of these journalists , they could have broken the pact .
how far can we take it ?
but at the same time , we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work .
there are great discoveries yet to be made down there , fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution and possibly bioactive compounds that could benefit us in ways that we can &apos;t even yet imagine .
sometimes the object will slide across the table , sometimes it will not .
and it got to the point where every time i walked up to a table that had a kid anywhere between three and 10 years old , i was ready to fight .
this is actually a period of dramatic change in which it doesn &apos;t take learning , per se , to drive the initial differentiation of the machinery of the brain .

and become the largest economy in the world .

that &apos;s my little son .
and instead of asking the question , &quot; &quot; how long until i see a head-tail-head ? &quot; &quot; — you can ask , &quot; &quot; how big will the chunks be when i use a restriction enzyme which cuts whenever it sees g-a-a-g , for example ?
their plumbing system turns off , so the sites have to move .
and these metals accumulate as minerals on the surface of the bacteria .
we believe that the markets is this magic pot that obeys only one command : make more money .
so what i &apos;m asking for is the creation of a new job title — i &apos;ll come to this a little later — and perhaps the addition of a new word into the english language .

what we do know is that the corals are going to get hit hard .
and what he showed in mantis shrimp is that they use what &apos;s called a &quot; &quot; catch mechanism , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; click mechanism . &quot; &quot; and what this basically consists of is a large muscle that takes a good long time to contract , and a latch that prevents anything from moving .
it says here that this is the ocean plane of the future .
what was interesting about their ruling and about the discussion we &apos;ve just had is that the discussion about the right , the justice , of the matter depended on figuring out what is the essential nature of golf .

this was actually used by the mayans as an artificial tooth replacement .
there is even a photo studio where you see the sort of aspiration to live in a real house or to be associated with a faraway place , like that hotel in sweden .
going deeper into the legacy of the eastern european regimes , i worked for several months on a story about the effects of industrial pollution , where there had been no regard for the environment or the health of either workers or the general population .

you don &apos;t think about how nicole kidman is maneuvering that dress — she just looks completely natural .
they &apos;ve got that wryly smile on their mouth .
those are the critical questions , and what we have learned from pisa is that , in high-performing education systems , the leaders have convinced their citizens to make choices that value education , their future , more than consumption today .
so in 2007 , our team won half a million dollars by placing third place in this competition .
but this depends on choosing a voluntary simplicity , growing qualitatively , not quantitatively .

they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; oh , ms. diversity lady , we &apos;re so glad you &apos;re here &quot; &quot; — ( laughter ) — &quot; but we don &apos;t have a biased bone in our body . &quot;
this is a 3d printer .
it you slow down , you reduce the amount of noise you make and you reduce the risk of collision .
it can do a tremendous amount of things .
abed would say , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; i then began to wonder , as i had many times before , how my life would have been different had this man not injured me , had my genes been fed a different helping of experience .
it &apos;s a closely held secret for reasons i don &apos;t know .

finally , you can see i did have a choice to choose one of the three quotes with which i wanted to start my lecture .

now , that &apos;s also wrong , because traffic happens to be a nonlinear phenomenon , meaning that once you reach above a certain capacity threshold then congestion starts to increase really , really rapidly .
my cuban mother , which i just briefly introduced you to in that short character sketch , came to the united states one thousand years ago .
but watch what happens when we make some of them disappear . right .
it &apos;s a heartbreaking , excruciating conversation .
those decisions are made by the ministry of health or by foreign donors , and it just kind of shows up .
that was the power of that word that he was able to do .
i mean , obviously the orchestra musicians playing beautifully , the vienna philharmonic orchestra .
and so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side or stack them up .
i came to the heart institute in 2006 , as part of my elective in my anesthesia and intensive care program .
so this is how much people agree with the conclusions with no image .
or had raided their frat parties in the middle of the night ?
bg : who should be providing this support ?
then the old lady came towards me with a rusty-looking knife , one of the sharp knives , orange-looking , has never seen water or sunlight before .
but we simply cannot reach new heights and create an even higher garbage dump , one that &apos;s out of this world .
so moving to our second commandment that i wanted to show you .
so you — it was fun to get away from high school — ( laughter ) — because i was very small , and i was no good in sports , or anything like that .
they didn &apos;t have data and statistics .
who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution ? universities ? forget about it !
of course , if anybody asked me then , &quot; where is your home ? &quot;
i didn &apos;t quite get it . and paul rand was a kind of crusty designer , you know , a crusty designer , like a good — kind of like a good french bread ?

these are members of my graduating class , 1986 .
we &apos;ve taken those circular fish-eye lens cameras , and we &apos;ve done some optical correction , and then we can bring it into three-dimensional life .
it was able — but only it was able — to organize health care , education , policing , justice .
if you noticed , in mountain home , there are trailer parks and trailers all over the place .
and the more you can recline , in a way , the better it is .

by the &apos; 70s , home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets — and we all have our favorites , actually — made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home .
and what we found was that indeed there was a correlation .
every time he paints these disturbing images , he sees them less or not at all .
but i think we &apos;re a lot closer to erring on the side of not comprehending the situation clearly enough , than in comprehending it so clearly that we just can &apos;t , you know , get the army out to kill terrorists .
and i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re here and that i &apos;m meeting you here at ted .
dogs get so abused .
he &apos;s now going to use the other thing which is essential , and that &apos;s his voice .
but can you imagine how many might have if the police had stopped those kids and searched their pockets for drugs as they walked to class ?
so , my kind of hero for this in the natural world are these tropical frogs .
the question of transformation in africa really is a question of leadership .
most of them did not go .
it wasn &apos;t a &quot; &quot; hindu rate of growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracies can &apos;t grow . &quot; &quot; actually india could .
and it &apos;s at this new frontier that we are forced with a new appraisal .
the other interesting thing for us — we like sensors — is this idea that you could have an on-ramp for the internet of things .
let &apos;s look at today .
so it could happen .
this seems to me both a deeply moving and a convincing re-statement of christian belief about god .
rng : that sort of co-option is all in the job description of reason .
it &apos;s called smart failure . why ? because you can &apos;t put it on your c.v.
so if we were to zoom into this guy &apos;s head , one of the things that you would see there is that there are no lymphatic vessels in the brain .
the united states , at this point , was putting pressure on all its arab allies , including tunisia , to stamp out extremism in their societies , and this imam found himself suddenly in the crosshairs of the tunisian intelligence service .
the reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure is not because giant squid eat jellyfish , but it &apos;s because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light when it &apos;s being chewed on by a predator and its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of a larger predator that will attack its attacker and thereby afford it an opportunity for escape .
a few months ago , i got a phone call from a nursing home where i work .
it is man-made and can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings . &quot; &quot; i want to end by saying it &apos;s been the actions of thousands of ordinary human beings doing — i think — extraordinary work , that have actually improved health , and , maybe only in a small way , reduced poverty .
and this , of course , is the basis of much of eastern philosophy , and that is there is no real independent self , aloof from other human beings , inspecting the world , inspecting other people .
and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong , powerful and athletic person well into the future .
but i can assure you that this woman in the favela in rio , she wants a washing machine .
they just want their own pain to end .
( laughter ) and i wanted it not just for myself but i wanted it for my students as well .
she was telling me how her treatment was leveraging specific properties of our vascular system .
something that exists as a series of interactions over time ?
it &apos;s a liberation from our misconceptions , and it &apos;s an incentive to not expect so much from ourselves and to simply begin .
you &apos;re probably aware that there have been a spate of those directed against the u.s. financial sector since 2012 .
but what if it was coordinated with the dozens of other acts of nonviolent resistance that have taken place against isis ?
this is kind of like something i used to do in third grade .
so that at the end of the treatment , you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment .
fact is , we &apos;re living in the most peaceful moment in human history .
now , if i &apos;ll take you through — this is an early concept sketch — take you through kind of a mixture of all these things together .
this is the city hall over here somewhere , and the courthouse .
here is where we want you to channel this money . &quot; &quot; each one should not be an entrepreneur going out and finding what is best .
number two : a declining population means scarce labor .
what we didn &apos;t realize is just how many people were ready and waiting to put the bias aside .
( laughter ) it was a man called brian , who runs a crack team of scientologists who are determined to destroy psychiatry wherever it lies .
now , it looks like you &apos;re doing yourself out of a job , but you &apos;re not . you &apos;re actually making yourself more useful .
the retina chip extracts four different kinds of information .
and on the right-hand side , we show the same data , but here with daily incidence .
mounted on roads or on police cars , automatic license plate readers capture images of every passing car and convert the license plate into machine-readable text so that they can be checked against hot lists of cars potentially wanted for wrongdoing .
but then there &apos;s a lot of problems that come with meat production , and we &apos;re being faced with that more and more often .
and if you look at things like the iphone app , the fraction is considerably larger .
we raised 200 million dollars in a specialty fund to work on a pandemic in biodefense .
nothing about that would have been problematic to the child at all .
child survival is the new green .
because primarily of the power of the internet , people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money that can change the world for some public good if they all agree .
that all depends on our motivation .
that means that ballplayer batted safely , hit safely three times out of 10 at bats .
there was the washing of hands .
ordinary homeowners and renters have saved more than 250 million dollars on their energy bills , and we &apos;re just getting started .
thank you .
but all this excitement led to the press writing about us .
it &apos;s neither magmatic or volcanic in origin , and again , over 700 kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center .
i had become a mother and he was celebrating his 77th birthday , and suddenly i was very , very afraid .
and for motivation , we used what i think is the most powerful pharmacology of switzerland : fine swiss chocolate .
you can go to orcatech.org — it has nothing to do with whales , it &apos;s the oregon center for aging and technology — to see more about that .
when diane hatz worked on &quot; &quot; the meatrix , &quot; &quot; her video that spread all across the internet about the way farm animals are treated , she didn &apos;t invent the idea of being a vegan .
but of course , as an end user , you don &apos;t see that , because you only see the name of the company , not where it was developed .
we could go back to babbage &apos;s machine and just make it tiny . all those things are computers .
the procedures that make this work have been perfected , as i said , by paul farmer and his team in their work in rural haiti over the last 20 years .
the other thing : i wanted to give indigenous people a voice .
it &apos;s not just a root supplying a plant , but for each of those plants , whatever it is — a presentation , an analysis , somebody &apos;s looking for patterns in the data — they get to look at all the data and they get it connected together , and the really important thing about data is the more things you have to connect together , the more powerful it is .
and we got a great group of people to join us — principled people with great skills , and investors with a vision and values to match ours .
it &apos;s a touch device that we have developed based on these algorithms , using standard graphics gpus .
but it &apos;s worth recalling wittgenstein &apos;s remark on the subject : &quot; &quot; tell me , &quot; &quot; he asked a friend , &quot; &quot; why do people always say it was natural for man to assume that the sun went &apos; round the earth , rather than that the earth was rotating ? &quot; &quot; and his friend replied , &quot; &quot; well , obviously , because it just looks as though the sun is going round the earth . &quot; &quot; wittgenstein replied , &quot; &quot; well , what would it have looked like if it had looked as though the earth was rotating ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) science has taught us , against all intuition , that apparently solid things , like crystals and rocks , are really almost entirely composed of empty space .
this shows you the positions of some of these dams .
and we had not — i mean , we weren &apos;t frightened by it .
and you can scroll around and see some of the different airports and the different patterns that they have .
and i was having fun with it .
when you see the headlines of your newspaper these days with the war in iraq or in syria — aid worker abducted , hostage executed — but who were they ?
conservation group gets together , tries to figure out how to breed an animal that &apos;s almost extinct .
it seemed that nothing could stop this relentless industrial machine .
and we need to diversify our farms .
there &apos;s another hub in london , now , and the rest are getting set up . we hope to give the data away at some stage . that &apos;s a complicated issue about making it available to the rest of the world .
and it has to be solvable in a magazine .
there &apos;s germany at 13th , the u.s. comes 21st , mexico comes 66th , and then we have some of the big developing countries , like russia at 95th , china at 107th .
and so i started getting amazing amounts of hate mail , death threats even .
and that includes nature , and nurture , and what i refer to as nightmares .
one thing that brings us close to home is we look at dick cheney &apos;s device , he had a device that pumped blood from an aorta to another part of the heart , and as you can see at the bottom there , it was controlled by a computer controller , and if you ever thought that software liability was very important , get one of these inside of you .
plastic is the defining feature of cheap electrical goods .
for this particular problem , we designed a new category of worker who , like a sars worker or someone looking for bird flu , might find first cases .

but then a couple of years later , when i was a company commander , i went out to the national training center .
you all got crisper drawers ?
they don &apos;t play 10 hours of action games in a row .
it is possible the answers we have are wrong , it is possible the questions themselves are wrong .
and i ran up the stairs , and there was one of my favorite books of all time , &quot; &quot; travels on my elephant &quot; &quot; by mark shand — i don &apos;t know if any of you know it .
so you &apos;re ( laughter ) you &apos;re really bored in the subway , and you kind of stare at something .
i can tap into thousands of people &apos;s minds . &quot; &quot; and the other nerdy side of me thought , &quot; &quot; this is horrible . this is completely bizarre .
so if you zoom in , what they &apos;re doing is holding these large molecules — nucleotides — together .
but nevertheless , neuroscience is turning up more and more in marketing .
so much for velcro , right ?
if , on the other hand , we need to look them all up , we may be in trouble .
i &apos;m going to show you some examples that i &apos;ve run into during my time at twitter — these are all real examples — of situations that at first seemed cut and dried , but the truth of the matter was something altogether different .
fifty percent of all the money that they earn or get gifted , 50 percent goes in their house account , 50 percent goes in their toy account .
and they &apos;re doing pretty well , but they &apos;ve got a bit of trouble .
we start with poverty .
sophos _ visitors , sansemea , companies i work with .
the reason for this is the way we make decisions .
but the problem is they &apos;re very fragmented .
so imagine that you &apos;re the participant in one of our experiments . you come into the lab , you see this computerized task .
we went down to the airfield early because this is the army and you always go early .
toxo infects mammals , a wide variety of mammals , but it can only sexually reproduce in a cat .
50 kilos for the entire fuselage .
so at the end , i had a settlement with them .
both of them create great public experiences of shared ritual .
there was no fishing , there was no pollution , there was no coastal development , and the reef is on a full-bore recovery .
in 1975 , muhammad ali gave a lecture at harvard university .
and this has become such a norm of our professional lives , such a norm and such an expectation .
they are mulling whether they &apos;re going to take it further .
and like a lot of people , i thought government was basically about getting people elected to office .
we are more closely related to the chimp and the bonobo than the african elephant is to the indian elephant , as jared diamond pointed out in one of his early books .
and , of course , arctic communities are toast .
it &apos;s not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have .
many in my generation — because of well-intentioned parenting and self-esteem education — were socialized to believe that we were special little snowflakes — ( laughter ) who were going to go out and save the world .
it &apos;s very easy , win the million dollars .
if someone then tries to reuse it , it locks and breaks afterwards .
by the early 20th century , the perfect balance of science and art had finally been struck with the emergence of medical illustrators .
and trust is established , not by some big institution , but by collaboration , by cryptography and by some clever code .
debbie has worked all her life , pays taxes , supports herself month to month , proud of the american dream , a dream that just won &apos;t be complete without higher education .
in the last nine years , he &apos;s been arrested 13 times , and jailed for a total of 130 days on that panhandling case .
so you have caught flesh-eating disease if you caught that one .
but these are people that you will probably never believe .
now , i explained this growth of complexity by reference to something called &quot; &quot; non-zero sumness . &quot; &quot; assuming that a few of you did not do the assigned reading , very quickly , the key idea is the distinction between zero-sum games , in which correlations are inverse : always a winner and a loser .
that doesn &apos;t detract from the fact that it &apos;s positive , but it means more people have to share in those benefits and recognize them .
we also changed the way we did criminal prosecutions .
and anyone who is interested in doing it in any health care situation , we will be happy to assist you and tell you how we &apos;ve done it , and how you can do it . if we do this , we can change the face of health care in africa .
and the people who avoid that have 30 percent less infectious disease or something .
you &apos;ll notice that the building is rather austere .
much of this progress comes from a method called &quot; &quot; machine learning . &quot; &quot; machine learning is different than traditional programming , where you give the computer detailed , exact , painstaking instructions .
( laughter ) now i &apos;ve got four or five penguins floating around my head , and i &apos;m just sitting there shooting away .
because each of us contains our entire gene code of where we &apos;ve been for the past billion years , because we &apos;ve evolved from that stuff , you can take that tree of life and collapse it back , and in the measure that you learn to reprogram , maybe we &apos;ll give birth to something that is very close to the first primordial ooze .
first of all , i thought , well , we need a sales team , and we clearly aren &apos;t the a-team here , so let &apos;s — i did all this training .
this caused not only problems , obviously , for the countries themselves , but also for the response .
the difference between arts and sciences is also not constructive versus deconstructive , right ? a lot of people think of the sciences as deconstructive .
she tried to look up her oncologist &apos;s phone number on the internet and she found it , but she found something else too .
in fact , without the optimism bias , we would all be slightly depressed .
( applause ) and this has created the space for my femininity to flourish in a way i had never experienced before .
( laughter ) so , you want to know where life is happening ?
so within less than three months of our team being on the ground , we were already able to push our first products to production .
it turned out that justin was almost certainly not autistic .
they believed in collaboration .
so in fact what we have now is a system where we can use people on the ground , people who are already there , who can both improve and use the existing connectivity , and we &apos;re using old cell phones that are being sent to us by people from around the world that want their phones to be doing something else in their afterlife , so to speak .
there are 13 species in the genus , and they have a particular behavior that i think you will find interesting .
with pivot , you can drill into a decade .
mantra stands for movement and action network for transformation of rural areas .
so on this bit of grassland , we &apos;ll do it , but just in the foreground .
but the point is that it &apos;s going to be a massive readjustment .
we &apos;re a visual species . when scientists first realized that bats were actually using sound to be able to fly and orient and move at night , we didn &apos;t believe it .
to perseverate means to focus obsessively and repeatedly on the exact same thing .
we are fighting against this .
and this is a video that was taken by my surgical mentor , dr. john niparko , who implanted her .
so the pulse enters the bottle , our bullet , with a packet of photons that start traveling through and that start scattering inside .
the audience is too small .
our collective optimism is reflected by the growth of biotechnology across the globe , striving to utilize scientific knowledge to cure human diseases .
i used to want to design a utopian society or a perfect world or something like that .
i don &apos;t know what the hell i &apos;m doing here .
we can make that happen , inexpensively .
but this does not follow any of the usual trends .
it &apos;s an amazing experience every time , no matter where you go .
as long as we can stay dry , that &apos;s a bonus .
and the funny thing is they call me mr. rambo in gaza .
i don &apos;t understand why i was never caught .
so far , the best idea i &apos;ve heard about building grit in kids is something called &quot; &quot; growth mindset . &quot; &quot; this is an idea developed at stanford university by carol dweck , and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed , that it can change with your effort .
and they are showing the signs of this .
what you will get is page after page of white , straight russian couples spray-tanned to the point of mahogany .
but as that space shuttle returns to earth , and as the astronauts enter the earth &apos;s gravitational field , they begin to see the effects of gravity .
now , how does it start ? it starts in schools .
this is a painting i did of my wife in my apartment .
so these guys were absolutely crucial .
he didn &apos;t say &quot; &quot; we have a dream . &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; i have a dream . &quot; &quot; why did he do that ? because most people are not at stage five .
but in many other countries , including my country , the us , there &apos;s actually no law on this , so in theory , you could do it .
is the wheel awesome ? say it with me .
it was accidentally released from the aquarium in monaco , it was bred to be cold tolerant to have in peoples aquaria .
so in wildlife rescue as in life , we learn from each previous experience , and we learn from both our successes and our failures .
also , and this makes me extremely proud , a costa rican woman , christiana figueres , played a decisive role in the negotiations of the paris climate agreement .
so , these are reviews of hundreds of studies by all the big muckety-mucks of the scientific pantheon in the united states , and these are the studies that show needle programs are effective — quite a lot of them .
and so here it is in the stomatopod . and again , this is a situation where engineers are very familiar with this phenomenon , because it destroys boat propellers .
it seems that cancer is a direct result to injury .
by the way , the pronunciation is &quot; &quot; eyjafjallajokull . &quot; &quot; none of your media got it right .
audience member 2 : spade .
&quot; &quot; did you hear about eddie ? he died last week .
their aim is to push the boundary of what can be achieved with autonomous flight .
older people usually are the leaders of traditional societies , and the people most knowledgeable about politics , medicine , religion , songs and dances .
but an amazing alternative energy company in paris is taking us off the grid with solar .
the success rate of the nerve transfers is very high .
i finished my quest , i got the girl .
turns out that there are three factors that you optimize for — and each of these are in complete opposite to what you learn at a business school .
in the early days of this modern markets technology , the financial institutions worked out how they could leverage their buying power , their back office processes , their relationships , their networks to shape these new markets that would create all this new activity .
to develop liquid metal battery , i hired students and post-docs and mentored them .
we &apos;re also , on top of that , integrating wireless networking into an affordable device with gps and gsm .
right now , if you want to test water in the field , you need a trained technician , expensive equipment like this , and you have to wait about a day for chemical reactions to take place and provide results .
so most of my work , i don &apos;t use glue .
and then each of these little spheres is the size of the earth in proportion to the sun .
( applause ) the saying is that with climate , those who know the most are the most worried .
my battery was dead . &quot; &quot; your battery wasn &apos;t dead .
ca : dan , i &apos;d like to hear more on this . so , you &apos;re saying that our response to terror is , i mean , it &apos;s a form of mental bug ?
here it is about 40 minutes later .
i wasn &apos;t raised with wealth or resources or any social standing to speak of .
rng : when our great grandchildren look back at us , will they be as appalled by some of our practices as we are by our slave-owning , heretic-burning , wife-beating , gay-bashing ancestors ?
we learned these things from outsiders .
but then , we &apos;re just a community group , you know .

but if we did this in every single — every fire hydrant we could redefine the emergency .
or in the case of double agents and traitors , like robert hanssen or aldrich ames , lies can betray our country , they can compromise our security , they can undermine democracy , they can cause the deaths of those that defend us .
my daughter katelyn , my 15-year-old , she and i were in the car , and we were driving down the road , and she was sitting there , and she had this idea , and she goes , &quot; &quot; dad , i &apos;ve got this idea . &quot; &quot; and so i listened to her idea and i said , &quot; &quot; katelyn , that &apos;s impossible . &quot; &quot; and she looks at me and she goes , &quot; &quot; dad , after what you just did , how can you call anything impossible ? &quot; &quot; and i laughed , and i said , &quot; &quot; ok , it &apos;s not impossible , it &apos;s just very , very hard . &quot; &quot; and then i paused for a second , and i said , &quot; &quot; katelyn , it may not be impossible , it may not even be very , very hard ,
now i remember that dinner i had with the minister of fisheries 10 years ago when we first brought this up and i got quite animated during the dinner and said , &quot; &quot; well , i think that the conservation community might embrace this idea , minister . &quot; &quot; he paused and put his hands together and said , &quot; &quot; yes , greg , but the devil will be in the details , &quot; &quot; he said .
they &apos;re the only ones that are dangerous .
and the same kind of technology — it &apos;s called dna barcoding , it &apos;s really cool — you can use it to check if your caviar is really beluga , if that sushi is really tuna , or if that goat cheese that you paid so much for is really goat &apos;s .
he would say , &quot; &quot; look , can you believe they have a mango here from mexico ?
let &apos;s start with the definition of schizophrenia .
but we can &apos;t do everything .
the biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you &apos;re designing there &apos;s actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form of the trailer .
beyond that , i didn &apos;t see anyone for 10 weeks .
this is a shot of cannery row in 1932 .
this is just like video conferencing today .
it really started from the destruction of the idea that the government is there because it &apos;s our government , meant to protect the larger public interest .
we have to send the fathers to de-addiction labs and when they come back , most times sober , we have to find a job for them so that they don &apos;t regress .
universes are opened and closed continually .
it only got a 500 , it could have gotten as high up as a 1,000 . &quot; &quot; and this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors into being approved as a car seat .
but of course , there &apos;s another story to this building .
for every nine people who have been executed , we &apos;ve actually identified one innocent person who &apos;s been exonerated and released from death row .
what do we know ? what do people do in these kinds of situations ?
ordinarily you wouldn &apos;t think so , but we &apos;re expecting an e , it &apos;s good enough , and yeah , i &apos;ve seen an e , and then apple says , &quot; yeah , i &apos;ve seen an apple . &quot;
we started using this technique in other problems , and i &apos;m going to tell you about a fascinating problem that we encountered , a case of dystonia .
if you &apos;re sitting in japan , or in new delhi , or in hanoi , your view of the rise of china is a little different than if you &apos;re sitting in beijing .
and so part of my goal is actually to change that and to educate and engage with the public and get you guys talking about this .
a toy gun where you shoot cola and get someone soaking wet ?
is it just literally for control , for hand-stick control ? why am i doing that ?
so for all domestic needs , women have to carry water .
developing the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidly depending on the demands of the situation , that &apos;s what you &apos;ve got to learn to do .
in conclusion , i am a scientist and a dreamer .
the next project i want to show was given to me in an email from a stranger .
not many people . okay .
migrants send money home , but they also save a large amount of money where they live .
that was the speech in which he coined that term .
( laughter ) at the beginning of each class , the professor would call on somebody to present the case .
they &apos;re also silicon .
redwood rainforest is incredibly difficult to move through , and even today , individual trees are being discovered that have never been seen before , including , in the summer of 2006 , hyperion , the world &apos;s tallest tree .
not by the latest combine and tractor invention , but by fertile land ; not by pumps , but by fresh water ; not by chainsaws , but by forests ; and not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the sea .
so what ?
and the audiences of storytellers are often deeply compassionate and empathetic people .
but as these conversations unfolded , i experienced what alice must have when she went down that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world .
if you bite into an organic or conventional papaya that is infected with the virus , you will be chewing on tenfold more viral protein .
as seymour showed back in the 1970s , flies , like songbirds , as you just heard , are capable of learning .
this little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren &apos;t .
and she said , &quot; &quot; well , now that i can walk again , i can go back and complete my studies . &quot; &quot; and to me she represents the next generation of engineers solving problems and ensuring meaningful technologies reach their users .
and in fact , the way that we can communicate today — where alaska is instantly knowing what &apos;s going on in china , and the kiwis did this , and then over in england they tried to ...
and yet , they can find them by tactile discrimination , and they can press it and select it .
and the light that falls onto our eyes is determined by multiple things in the world , not only the color of objects , but also the color of their illumination , and the color of the space between us and those objects .
it &apos;s how they understand access to this culture .
so that suggests to us that our sense of self does not end at the last layer of the epithelium of our bodies , but it ends at the last layer of electrons of the tools that we &apos;re commanding with our brains .
( laughter ) are you an ethical consumer worried about what the drugs industry is doing ?
it gets very expensive to do this research .
how can we make it more successful ?
they reverse-engineer manuals .
how else to describe this , but as a form of mass insanity ?
we made mistakes . we should expect mistakes .
in particular , there &apos;s a medication , valproic acid , which mothers with epilepsy sometimes take , we know can increase that risk of autism .
and everything from the kidney , to the testes , to the back bone , to the fin muscle to — i think that ís pretty much the whole fish — is eaten .
and here is a picture of the khmer rouge .
he &apos;s at about 40 to 50 percent of his previous performance before the lesion .
if we didn &apos;t have this present moment , we wouldn &apos;t have any opportunity to do anything or experience anything , and this moment is a gift .
so , all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them , and i think as designers we need to really think about how we can create a different relationship between our work and the world , whether it &apos;s for business , or , as i &apos;m going to show , on some civic-type projects .
and you can basically see that the richer a country is , the older the people are within it .
we &apos;ll make a new film about this process .
so , 27 years ago i got a traffic ticket that got me thinking .
in a deep , dark canyon off the coast of california , we found the first biofluorescent swellshark , right underneath all the surfers .
what &apos;s the point of that ?
&quot; &quot; bad bear , bad bear ! &quot; &quot; voom !
how can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full dexterity of our hands ?
now when i screamed at my children to stop , sometimes they would both say to me the other person hit them harder .
i have a fairly bad memory , and dishonesty would always get me in trouble , if i , like — so i &apos;ve just sort of been naturally honest and naturally inquisitive , and that sort of leads to that kind of science .
they truly perform as they transform through time and as communities negotiate the spaces and boundaries and resources .
this satellite covers the whole of africa and goes back as far as 1984 , and that &apos;s important , because if you know how many times a place has had a drought in the last 30 years , you can make a pretty good estimate what the chances are of drought in the future , and that means that you can put a price tag on the risk of drought .
we put waste water and some source of co2 into our floating structure , and the waste water provides nutrients for the algae to grow , and they sequester co2 that would otherwise go off into the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas .
and when you find a lone nut doing something great , have the guts to be the first one to stand up and join in .
i call them lessons to change the world .
i love being around these big wind generators .
the science risk was under control .
wait for it .
this is your life . this is ... this is ... this is your life .
or will some of the metallic objects launched from the earth spawn new oases , a post-human life elsewhere ?
they were using parks they weren &apos;t using before .
today , though , i ’ m going to talk about darwin ’ s other strange inversion , which is equally puzzling at first , but in some ways just as important .
nature naturally has allowed carbon dioxide to go up to 280 parts per million .
after energy production , livestock is the second-highest contributor to atmosphere-altering gases .
and the purity of the music makes you hear it very effectively .
these are also , these tar-fueled protocells , are also able to locate resources in their environment .
computers sort of came around through games and toys .
thank you .
but then i found out , it already is .
otto marseus , nice painting , which is &quot; &quot; still life &quot; &quot; at the pitti gallery , and just have an infrared camera peering through , and luckily for art historians , it just was confirmed that there is a signature of otto marseus . it even says when it was made and also the location .
so there is , in china , there is a different kind of mechanism to be responsive to the demands and the thinking of the people .
and so it &apos;s very difficult to get there , if you do it physically .
and so there is this other unique material trait that these materials have , that they &apos;re programmably degradable .
and i invite you all to be part of the conversation .
so , you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually moving away from the light , toward the dark foundations .
now we have to get through the ice .
so they can use the 1984 scenario data mining of the dissident .
if there &apos;s a real rose there , those molecules will be the ones , but even if there &apos;s no rose there , you &apos;ll have the memory of a molecule .
i write fiction sci-fi thrillers , so if i say &quot; &quot; killer robots , &quot; &quot; you &apos;d probably think something like this .
&#91; arabic &#93; and this roughly translates : &quot; &quot; please , let me hold your hand .
we &apos;re working with the guy who invented the seawater greenhouse .
but most importantly , it &apos;ll be a tremendous expansion of human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology , which in some sense we &apos;re doing already .
now imaginative people have been having fun with this for over 400 years .
i use planet earth to go in very extreme environments where conditions were similar to those of mars at the time when the climate changed , and there i &apos;m trying to understand what happened .
it &apos;s pressure from the human population hunting and destroying their habitats which has done so .
but as the social researcher charles murray has documented , as we started to automate the economy , and 1960 is just about when computers started to be used by businesses , as we started to progressively inject technology and automation and digital stuff into the economy , the fortunes of bill and ted diverged a lot .
and it &apos;s been the same in every single room , in every town that we &apos;ve ever told our story .
and so i want to tell you today about baxter , which we &apos;ve been talking about .
first , soon , and then a lot .
this is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand — it &apos;s all about sex tips .
tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels .
we live in an incredibly busy world .
here &apos;s another view of the same .
it &apos;s a 40-year-old company , it understands manufacturing .
so i spent three months in kenya , uganda and tanzania interviewing entrepreneurs that had received 100 dollars to start or grow a business .
how can that not make you feel optimistic for the future ?
this guy up here ?
when people think of holmes , they think of his nemesis being professor moriarty , right , this criminal mastermind .
there &apos;s a number , five to 10 countries in africa that has the same level as sweden and united states .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong .
this is an unnamed species of copepod . a copepod is a crustacean .
we did our best to find reasons to laugh .
too small for detection , it &apos;s your built-in protection .
i learned that success isn &apos;t a one-way street .
now , what good is it to have that ?
for almost five years i stayed there , and we focused on fighting a war that was unconventional and it was difficult and it was bloody and it often claimed its highest price among innocent people .
chris anderson : we had edward snowden here a couple days ago , and this is response time .
i don &apos;t have to be paying attention to what i hear .
so it &apos;s time we make a promise of a world in which we &apos;ve broken the stranglehold that nuclear weapons have on our imaginations ; in which we invest in the creative solutions that come from working backward from the future we desperately want , rather than plodding forward from a present that brings all of the mental models and biases of the past with it .
second question : what causes these changes ?
we &apos;ve watched the financial markets that we uniquely create — these markets that were supposed to be foolproof — we &apos;ve watched them kind of collapse before our eyes .
at the same time , a civil war was taking place in el salvador , and again , the civilian population was caught up in the conflict .
so let &apos;s send into this graph a bunch of tiny , digital marbles and let them go randomly through the graph .
there were 93 of us , and we were all below deck .
so we see some green shoots that things are getting better .
so honeybees are important for their role in the economy as well as in agriculture .
and when he saw i was painting in arabic , he got so mad — actually , hysterical — and he asked for the wall to be erased .
the striking thing about it is that only face recognition is impaired ; everything else is just fine .
so , it &apos;s not a palm pilot by any stretch of the imagination , but it has a thumb-scroll so you can do everything with one hand .
we wish we &apos;d gotten more of it .
and finally , she has a dermatitis on the fingers of her right hand , a dermatitis that is unique to the linoleum factory workers in burntisland . &quot; &quot; and when bell actually strips the patient , begins to examine the patient , you can only imagine how much more he would discern .
a momentous thing that can happen to a culture is they can acquire a new style of arguing : trial by jury , voting , peer review , now this . right ?
its closest relative is , in fact , from mice , and so we would call this a xenotropic retrovirus , because it &apos;s infecting a species other than mice .
and in the life that everyone sees , who i am is a friend , a son , a brother , a stand-up comedian and a teenager .
for what it &apos;s worth , we went to sagres , which was considered , at the time , to be the end of the world .
they &apos;re molecules that protect other molecules as they move through a cell .
it started on a given day , and then the students would watch videos on a weekly basis and do homework assignments .
these are community affairs , by the way .
look , i can prove this to you : here &apos;s a little lottery .
so they copy each other .
this worked .
i &apos;m not talking about the kind of technology that has enveloped our lives , and that people come to ted to hear about .
that &apos;s the only way they are effective .
( applause ) i have a cd here . i &apos;m sorry that i didn &apos;t say anything on time .
and for dollars , is their 30 million , plus the 20 million dollars from the american manufacturer .
you don &apos;t have to dig deep down underground .
now we have taken on a second thing , and this gets to my wish .
it is february and not lying is impossible . &quot; &quot; and i really spend a lot of time wondering , how much truth do we tell ?
( laughter ) but that &apos;s the work i &apos;m doing with biosentient corporation trying to figure out how do we integrate these things ?
there &apos;s no dynamic , there &apos;s no highs or lows , if everything is awesome .
this is just the grassroots stuff again , ok ?
this is a pretty involved process ; it took us about four and a half years .
and all of you need to have it embedded in your brains and to organize yourselves around it .
he took owl monkeys , wired them up so that a computer watched their brains while they moved , especially looking at the movement of their right arm .
his current obsession is to leave lebanon at any cost — even if it meant embarking on a hazardous journey along with refugees drifting towards europe today through the mediterranean .
i am a nomadic artist .
rather than just cutting costs , you need to think about initiatives that will enable you to win in the medium term , initiatives to drive growth , actions that will fundamentally change the way the company operates , and very importantly , investments to develop the leadership and the talent .
it &apos;s now two years that you &apos;ve been running ?
( video ) computer : a cat lying on a bed in a blanket .
it matters for now . it matters as soon as possible .
it is in our dna to be curious .
we decorated every bulletin board in that building with bright , colorful , and positive messages .
but as humans with hearts , we can all rejoice in the unity of life , and perhaps we can change what once happened in that sacred cave .
they touched me when i was four and i lost my eyesight and was partially paralyzed .
we &apos;re looking at building on some of the most precious resources of africa : people .
and i &apos;ve never really felt very motivated by pecking orders or by superchickens or by superstars .
and it &apos;s found in cotton fields , and coltan mines , and even car washes in norway and england .
and do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error and not machine error , and can therefore be prevented by machines ?
but this man doesn &apos;t need to go there .
look at the solar system , and look at the earth .
( applause ) our friends in law enforcement have much to do , because we &apos;ve seen that online violence is an extension of in-person violence .
today there are approximately 6.8 billion people in the world , and within our lifetime , that number &apos;s going to grow to about nine billion .
and so sometimes these analogous experiences , analogous role-play , can also be quite valuable .
just in the past couple years , we &apos;ve seen digital tools display skills and abilities that they never , ever had before , and that kind of eat deeply into what we human beings do for a living .
and language can &apos;t be understood in its abstraction .
this is one of those alternatives .
and there &apos;s things that no one &apos;s voice can do .
and that &apos;s not a good experience , to leave a gallery like that .
it was something i read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in iraq . and she said , &quot; save a man from drowning , you are responsible to him for life . &quot;
i told you last year , i &apos;ll tell you again , my mother was born in egypt , and i — who am i ?
&quot; &quot; you want me to deliver human rights throughout my global supply chain .
but you might not realize that our ability to look into the body in this simple way , using our senses , is quite recent .
and i resemble that remark .
these models are around a million lines of code at this point , and growing by tens of thousands of lines of code every year .
you show all these interconnections , all these interrelations .
( &quot; &quot; what &apos;s a jurassic park ? &quot; &quot; ) now , what is the story here ?
i do not want to have my opinions challenged .
in essence , could we &quot; &quot; app &quot; &quot; chemistry ?
so i traveled there last year , and part of the joy i had in going there was going to these caves .
ak : it &apos;s a great question , or , said better , this is a question we &apos;ve been receiving in the media for possibly the last year .
when in &apos; 96 i was sent by the united nations high commissioner for refugees to the north caucasus , i knew some of the risks .
so amazon went for six years without returning any profit to investors , and people had patience .
it was instrumental in stopping commercial whaling , and was built on the idea that if we couldn &apos;t save whales , what could we save ?
for example , ship captains needed to know information about the tides in order to safely dock at ports .
and so they gave me this name : kè , which means to overcome or to conquer , and wén , and that &apos;s the character for literature or the arts .
they gave her just a couple of months to live .
the matching idea has been successfully used to match , for instance , students with university places , to match kidney donors with patients , and it underlies the kind of algorithms that exist on dating websites .
he started , as i mentioned , to get in the room with evil , to not denounce , and became almost obsequious when he won the nickname serbio , for instance , and even when he negotiated with the khmer rouge would black-box what had occurred prior to entering the room .
this is a child , and what you &apos;re seeing here is real data , and on the far right-hand side , where everything starts getting a little bit catastrophic , that is the patient going into cardiac arrest .
we finance anything that a media company would need , from printing presses to transmitters .
there &apos;s also a great deal , i think , of religious illiteracy around .
there &apos;s lust , which is just wanting to have sex .
na : well the yemen times , across 20 years , has been through so much .
we don &apos;t work from offices .
so from sixth through 12th grade , once , twice , sometimes three times a week , i would take classes at the art museum , and i was surrounded by other kids who loved to draw , other kids who shared a similar passion .
fg : no . not now either .
in addition to the supply levers that we can push — and remember , we need large amounts , because at the moment , we get 90 percent of our energy from fossil fuels — in addition to those levers , we could talk about other ways of solving this issue .
even now , man may be unwittingly changing the world &apos;s climate through the waste products of his civilization .
but we do have the first three minutes .
they dumped us there .
i &apos;m not really sure what &apos;s on the other side of this hill .
i want to start with a story , a la seth godin , from when i was 12 years old .
this animation from my friends at proton studios shows looking at the big bang from the outside .
we take their supply chain , we take all the factory names , we do a random sample , we send inspectors on an unannounced basis to inspect those facilities , and then we publish the results .
( laughter ) we writers , we kind of do have that reputation , and not just writers , but creative people across all genres , it seems , have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable .
it &apos;s because i &apos;m seeing an equation and they &apos;re dealing with exponents and that 30 percent that i didn &apos;t know is showing up .
but this is it .
i mean , i could tell you hundreds of them .
so , and you get all the disease-protective substances .
does that mean we &apos;ve doubled the number of pieces of information we need to know , from 120 to 240 ?
but we can &apos;t have a system that closes that data off , because it is too rich of a source of inspiration , innovation and discovery for new things in medicine .
next i worked with the japanese agency , aq , on a research project into mental health .
you can step on the scale .
so bageye is bald and has baggy eyes .
susan parks of penn state has actually studied this .
but there &apos;s a unity of some sort that &apos;s starting to emerge .
the results of this kind of work are simple and they &apos;re powerful .
it &apos;s so amazing , it &apos;s so exciting .
and they grow and grow by stages . and they climb out of the water , burst out , as the adult which we see .
and so they did something that &apos;s really radical , when you think about how government is used to working .
governments get elected , and then they fall below 50 percent approval in a few months and stay there and get worse until the next election .
so our children are getting larger , but at the same time we are growing into different directions .
( laughter ) it &apos;s in all seven continents , including antarctica .
in britain , it could mean looking to the french , learning from the french , getting directly elected mayors in place in a french commune system .
metal peppered his face .
but what i &apos;d like to talk about today is the fact that this morning , about a billion people on earth — or one out of every seven — woke up and didn &apos;t even know how to fill this cup .
one billion grains of sand come into existence in the world each second .
so as an academic , we &apos;re always trained to be able to jump through hoops to raise funding for our labs , and we get our robots to do that .
we &apos;ve seen what happens when we divide an already small planet into smaller islands .
i think that torajans socially recognize and culturally express what many of us feel to be true despite the widespread acceptance of the biomedical definition of death , and that is that our relationships with other humans , their impact on our social reality , doesn &apos;t cease with the termination of the physical processes of the body , that there &apos;s a period of transition as the relationship between the living and the dead is transformed but not ended .
in this talk today , i want to present a different idea for why investing in early childhood education makes sense as a public investment .
there &apos;s a lot of information here .
so i started doubting myself and wondering what was the real purpose of this whole project ?
it was in far western new south wales .
and we don &apos;t even know the shape of the language .
it should be thought of as a biological moonshot with a timetable .
( laughter ) of course it &apos;s meant to be funny , but in all seriousness , suicidal ideation is quite common with traumatic brain injuries .
so , this it isn &apos;t something that is still undergoing lab tests .
i forgot my discretion .
the musicians hate them .
the warriors won the game and went on to win the championship .
but densification is not going to work everywhere .
now , i think one of the reasons — i &apos;ll try to convince you today — is that we have a fundamental misconception about the power of time .
how are you trying to uplift nutrition and survival and literacy so these countries can take care of themselves , and say wow , this is going well , and be smarter .
so suppose your goal is to get kids into school .
so we can now , in a matter of hours , determine a whole human genome .
but frankly there are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from nyu , have them go study for a semester at the university of arkansas , and vice versa . do it at the high school level .
why ? why do we have to be left out ?
that &apos;s what your genes are doing every day .
you can imagine what it was like in the winter at 10,000 feet .
i can &apos;t think of a single general principle of biology that does not have an exception somewhere by some organism .
it &apos;s a beautiful day .
we talked to 600 drug addicts in three cities in indonesia , and we said , &quot; &quot; well , do you know how you get hiv ? &quot; &quot; &quot; oh yeah , by sharing needles . &quot;
well , it &apos;s been 18 years now since verdana and georgia were released .
it &apos;s just part of your neighborly duty .
and so , you know , 390 percent approval rating ain &apos;t so bad .
sometimes it shows you what you shouldn &apos;t do .
and this is the wire opera theater . we did it in two months .
i don &apos;t know how many of you might imagine it , but there &apos;s actually a tedster who recently got back from iraq .
this has changed .
in 2002 , a group of treatment activists met to discuss the early development of the airplane .
so that is a non-zero-sum dynamic .
notice how few barriers there are to movement across all of the oceans compared to land .
that was the last month for the year of the horse .
it &apos;s a wonderful day in our country &apos;s history ; it &apos;s a wonderful day in the globe &apos;s history to be able to have an actual sitting president say , enough of this — first to himself , and then to the rest of the world .
i mean , it &apos;s the same story . it &apos;s just different names .
in my experience , in fact , the light footprint was extremely helpful .
now , in a word , the answer is &quot; &quot; rules . &quot; &quot; bad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that &apos;s available when people can bring new technologies in and make them available to someone like nelson .
animals are not just raw materials .
all right .
and the hell creek project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find , and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them .
so today what you have is what i call the middle 40 percent , the people who are not in the top 10 and who are not in the bottom 50 , and what you can view as the wealth middle class that owns 20 to 30 percent of total wealth , national wealth , whereas they used to be poor , a century ago , when there was basically no wealth middle class .
if you look at the scene , egypt , for 30 years , had been in a downhill — going into a downhill .
and let me give you a few illustrations .
and so i can generate a force feedback .
and there &apos;s five or six different compilations there , but each one of those compilations reflects input from hundreds of these kinds of records from corals .
but i do think it &apos;s an important conversation .
so it blinks one second after you do .
if you look up high enough , you could see me .
( laughter ) which isn &apos;t a great idea .
and this brings us to our third part of the exercise , which is to draw how to make toast , but this time in a group .
in fact , in go , there are more possible moves than there are atoms in the universe .
we &apos;ve shared transportation .
and then 10 years from now , billions will again have gone into africa , and we would still have the same problems .
and we might be able to find evidence of our own origin in the most unlikely place , and this place in mars .
instead of thinking about what to build , building in order to think .
so i hope there aren &apos;t too many psychologists in this audience .
but online , everybody speaks at the same speed .
we surround ourselves with people who feel the same way we do , and we approve each other , and that &apos;s a really good feeling .
number two : free trade .
we also studied vineet nayar at hcl technologies , an indian outsourcing company .
but sometimes we are only five doctors and 16 nurses , and we are physically getting exhausted to see all of them .
we knew they worked through old-fashioned trial and error .
and so most of you aren &apos;t tackling oppressive regimes on the weekends , so i wanted to think of a few examples that might be a little bit more relatable .
( applause ) thank you .
and having the goal in mind , thinking about where it might lead , directed me to a life of looking at all of the small details to allow this to become possible , to be able to launch and go help build a space station where you are on board a million-pound creation that &apos;s going around the world at five miles a second , eight kilometers a second , around the world 16 times a day , with experiments on board that are teaching us what the substance of the universe is made of and running 200 experiments inside .
so the first unproven claim is that you can use brain scans to read people &apos;s thoughts and emotions .
he &apos;s become the head of art center , and there &apos;s a building by craig ellwood there .
and when you have a hum like that , you can &apos;t help but strive for greatness .
and we as humans are social creatures and must , or are aided by , or enjoy more , the consumption of information in the presence of others .
and although today is about innovation without borders , i have to say that in my life , innovation has only been possible because of my borders .
and his mother told me this story of coming home one day — and he went to college nearby — and she said , &quot; &quot; i saw that car , which you can always recognize , in the parking lot of a bar , &quot; &quot; she said . ( laughter ) &quot; &quot; and i thought to myself , they &apos;re six feet tall , he &apos;s three feet tall .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future normally as experiences .
and we &apos;re in the process of sequencing all that at the present time .
you see , anything that uses a lot of energy is going to produce heat , and we don &apos;t observe this .
here are two very different walls , very different geometric pictures .
we make it really , really simple for me as well as anyone else who wants to use the site .
what if there were a pure form of justice ?
three : i failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude , not a lifestyle .
i &apos;m not suggesting that obesity is benign , but what i am suggesting is it may be the lesser of two metabolic evils .
it is growing all around us .
and so it &apos;s going to try to watch your response .
and bp was hardly our first experience of this in recent years .
they &apos;re killed ; we don &apos;t even hear about them .
and you &apos;ll be left in peace to talk to the person you really want to talk to .
here we are on october the 19th .
and once again , it &apos;s this invitation that asks people to lay down on the glacier and give it a hug .
done well , of course .
in the &apos; 60s already , through the green revolution and the haber-bosch process of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere — you know , human &apos;s today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole .
and here are two different images of the archimedes manuscript .
now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that gallup survey .
so i want to show you a clip of the film now .
the secret is , they have an eco-tourism program , which is absolutely brilliant .
and i understood that his surprise was my protection .
what i &apos;m not suggesting is that microbial cellulose is going to be a replacement for cotton , leather or other textile materials .
the world trade organization : treaty-based organization , entirely treaty-based , and yet , powerful enough to hold even the most powerful , the united states , to account if necessary .
so here you can see the left camera , the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the airpix .
and he took the thing and he looked up to steve and he said , &quot; look , hydrophobic string . &quot;
and for the future it won &apos;t serve us .
people consciously follow things even though , why , we don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t want to say in any way that it only has to do with what we do , but what i do know is that our work and the work that we do may have helped a lot of them start thinking about demobilization , and it may have helped a lot of them take the final decision .
we also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road .
i am an emotional , i am an emotional , incondotional , devotional creature .
but even more , i had a brother die in a tragic accident at 15 , and something as simple as this means we won &apos;t be together as a family .
this is just a fact of human nature that has been recognized in social science and in literature and in religion and in virtually every field of discipline .
if you don &apos;t like the 24 / 7 all kardashian all the time programming , you &apos;ve got to stop clicking on the stories about kim kardashian &apos;s sideboob .
so i said , &quot; &quot; i am dead , so i need to be born again . &quot; &quot; so , i wanted to be a painter like him , except , i don &apos;t know how to paint .
all right ?
but this is a problem of just incentives , just incentives .
the scientists i was with were not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff — the birds , the turtles , the dolphins , the glamorous stuff .
first one is really a question of origins .
this is the environmental conditions on the planet .
i &apos;m a visual artist , and i &apos;m also one of the co-founders of the plastic pollution coalition .
so when you see this march on washington in 1963 , when you look at that picture , where this is the march where martin luther king gave his famous &quot; &quot; i have a dream &quot; &quot; speech , 1963 , you don &apos;t just see a march and you don &apos;t just hear a powerful speech , you also see the painstaking , long-term work that can put on that march .
( laughter ) it &apos;s a pair of earmuffs and a set of safety goggles that have been masked over except for two small pinholes , because distraction is the competitive memorizer &apos;s greatest enemy .
( laughter ) let me take you back to the early 1960s .
malaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year .
and husbands can drag their wives across , if their wives don &apos;t feel ready .
and big companies like intel or smaller design firms like ideo or startups like bump , were inviting me to give workshops , just to practice this idea of smashing electronics and everyday objects together .
have you been to southern spain lately ? there are roads everywhere .
the first is the policy challenge of designing and implementing alternatives to ineffective prohibitionist policies , even as we need to get better at regulating and living with the drugs that are now legal .
when the environmentalists speak with economists , it &apos;s like a schizophrenic dialogue , completely incoherent .
and the last story i &apos;m going to talk about is quite a story .
mastery : the desire to get better and better at something that matters .
and the thing is , though , if you looked at my brain during those years in the moonies — neuroscience is expanding exponentially , as ray kurzweil said yesterday . science is expanding .
i also translate weather data into musical scores .
and you saw ty &apos;s little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the convolution program right before your eyes .
you &apos;ll all agree with me , i &apos;m sure .
design really looks upon the whole world and it considers the world in all of its different ranges .
heparin — a blood thinner , a pharmaceutical product — starts out in artisanal workshops like this in china , because the active ingredient comes from pigs &apos; intestines .
and this was true for all the pair-wise combinations of tasks .
so there &apos;s a list there of the different countries that have it , and then there &apos;s a few more coming on board .
and that &apos;s hard to do if you don &apos;t know who you are .
now , in regard to the current economic crisis , we think that we will just wake up again and everything will be the same as before , and no political or social changes are needed .
but we made it to pennsylvania .
but today i want to go a little bit deeper , and think about what the nature of this is .
after all , there are many other countries who face the same issues that we face .
we have to trust a lot of procedures .
thank you very much for your time .
are we still capable of that as a country ?
but for the first time in history , we have the technology ; we have the know-how ; we have the cash ; we have the life-saving drugs .
and lebanon ? struggling , of course , but it &apos;s managing .
and he &apos;s sitting there in front of the haptic device , the force feedback system , and he &apos;s moving his pen towards the heart , and the heart is now beating in front of him , so he can see how the heart is beating .
start from what they know . build on what they have . &quot; &quot; this was kind of the defining slogan .
so we &apos;ve created formulations for all around the world using regional byproducts .
now , our big symbol at ideo is actually not so much the place , it ’ s a thing .
and so it &apos;s quite surprising that many of us let our unconscious influence those decisions in ways that we are not quite aware of .
and therefore we know that women are not getting the full benefit of modern science and medicine today .
and she was also famous for walking up to a 15-foot rope , climbing it using only her arms , and then shuffling away and apologizing , because she knew she was supposed to use both her arms and her legs , as the rangers had trained them .
but when sarah jones asked me to please come to ted , i said , well , you know , first , i don &apos;t know that , you know — before two years ago , you would not find me in front of an audience of people , much less like this because i did not like to give speeches because i feel that , as an immigrant , i do not have good english skills for speaking .
now , i know some of you all are probably thinking , how did you find a great mentor in prison ?
and so , in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks , rather than somehow sensing the day outside .
keep learning .
( laughter ) we are right now seeing a much larger scale of tracking of individual citizens than he could have ever imagined .
you just know what it feels like to live in a closet .
that &apos;s true no matter what thing you &apos;re talking about .
they have it running through mazes , controlling where it &apos;s going .
once we define somebody as an enemy , we have trouble putting ourselves in their shoes , just naturally .
here &apos;s a map a lawyer made . he put on it the water plant , and which houses are there , which houses have been connected to the water .
let &apos;s start with iraq .
if we allowed refugees to do that , it would have major advantages .
he was born there in 1924 .
by 2030 , if the maize , or corn , varieties , which is the dominant crop — 50 percent of the nutrition in southern africa are still in the field — in 2030 , we &apos;ll have a 30 percent decrease in production of maize because of the climate change already in 2030 .
and so i &apos;m writing a new book .
but of course , you know , the reason you &apos;re laughing is bad for humans too .
we &apos;ve worked with a bunch of universities on a project looking at interactive newsprint .
we will install panels on your roof .
we &apos;ve driven from san francisco to los angeles on highway 1 .
you feel naked , exposed and vulnerable , but that vulnerability , that humility , it can be an extraordinary benefit to the practice of medicine .
let &apos;s multiply this sound by four-thirds . ( beep ) what happens ?
and the red line is the treatment as usual — medication with a medical doctor .
and we now have 350-pound auto workers learning bird songs on the internet .
you have half of an idea , somebody else has the other half , and if you &apos;re in the right environment , they turn into something larger than the sum of their parts .
this was something we did with ibm that &apos;s a little bit more than a year old .
what it means is , when she sat in a restaurant in years to come , 10 years to come , 15 years to come , or she &apos;s on the beach , every so often she &apos;s going to start rubbing her skin , and out of there will come a piece of that shrapnel .
and this acoustical nuisance and visual nuisance basically exposed the discomfort of the work to this encompassing nature of the retrospective .
currently , the new narrative about braddock , a poster child for rust belt revitalization , is a story of urban pioneers discovering a new frontier .
so take a simple example , with r equals five percent and g equals one percent , wealth holders only need to reinvest one fifth of their capital income to ensure that their wealth rises as fast as the size of the economy .
but outside of that , i didn &apos;t really realize why it mattered that my parents were from two different places .
and since that time , this has been replicated 20 times .
obviously this is not a mandated duty , but for the gifted filmmaker and the responsible journalist or even blogger , it strikes me as being utterly inescapable .
and i &apos;ve always believed that the act of architecture , even a private house , when somebody else will see it , is a political act , because it will be visible to others .
the countries on the left have a form at the dmv that looks something like this .
because if we do , i can look forward to the conversation i &apos;m going to have with my daughter in 20 years .
and all of these things combine to create an enormous amount of torque on the planet .
we know that little skippy is loading his uzi down here , getting ready for homeroom . ( laughter ) we know that heather , his sister heather , 14 years old , is turning tricks up here to support her drug habit .
it doesn &apos;t look like much — in fact , it isn &apos;t like much .
and we said , &quot; &quot; well , there &apos;s another option .
and that changed , first with ships when we had the renaissance , the scientific revolution and also the industrial revolution .
when we have enough of them , we &apos;re going to have a nation that &apos;s not worth defending .
when your children and grandchildren sort of pose questions to you about this period of time , one of the things they &apos;re gonna ask you , is how it was they we allowed some of our closest living relatives , some of the most valuable and endangered species on our planet , to go extinct because we weren &apos;t able to address some of the issues of poverty in these parts of the world .
it &apos;ll be built into architecture .
and i &apos;m happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist .
but i also know that if you really understand me now , then your brain ... and your brain ... and your brain are really similar to mine .
what do any parent do ?
to do this , we &apos;ve had to make recordings of people laughing , and we &apos;ve had to do whatever it takes to make people laugh , and we got those same people to produce more posed , social laughter .
my father worked as a policeman in the city .
so in the end , he patted me on the shoulder like a swim coach might .
i was born in a scots presbyterian ghetto in canada , and dropped out of high school . i don &apos;t own a cell phone , and i paint on paper using gouache , which hasn &apos;t changed in 600 years .
i have a hard time envisioning a future in which someone is saying , &quot; &quot; where , oh where , can i find a picture of a cute cat ? &quot; &quot; ushahidi , by contrast , is civic value .
part of that is true , there aren &apos;t as many prominent women in technology .
it doesn &apos;t catch every little thing that &apos;s going on .
this is a huge space that contains all words in such a way that the distance between any two of them is indicative of how closely related they are .
but according to a committee of academics convened by the national academy of sciences last year , the relationship between our historically high incarceration rates and our low crime rate is pretty shaky .
and then , once we start making those kinds of connections and asking those important and big questions , then we can talk about how we can be transformative , in other words , how can we do something differently ?
and no matter what country you live or work in , you &apos;ve also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of , even in their most ordinariness .
and it occurred to me that in this whole non-governmental world , somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets .
they actually see landscapes and human beings and gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that .
so what happened when the professor left the room ?
the yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars , creating carbon dioxide and alcohol — essentially it &apos;s burping and sweating , which is what bread is .
could i be misinterpreting the nature of my perceptions ?
and there was an unexpected speaker who wasn &apos;t on the program , and he talked about dna .
and we didn &apos;t study any of these animals .
in a 2015 survey of 70,000 employees , two-thirds of everyone who is paid at the market rate said that they felt they were underpaid .
so for instance , a biotechnology company has now found broadly neutralizing antibodies to influenza , as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus .
little , ring , middle , index . and then open .
fourth , feedback .
i don &apos;t want opinions ; i want knowledge .
these copepods are a major constituent of the oceans , and they are a major part of the diet of grazing baleen whales .
and what is significant about the program is that we learned a number of things .
tedtalks can &apos;t be a one-way process , one-to-many .
so in looking at that , i also realized that i was really angry .
it &apos;s a very simple behavior that shows you the power of this approach .
you add other forms of innovation and processor design , you get a doubling of price performance of computing every one year .
we don &apos;t know what causes them .
the question i would ask is , &quot; &quot; what &apos;s worth solving ? &quot; &quot; if you haven &apos;t seen this , it &apos;s pretty amazing .
to try this , i went to a mario batali restaurant in manhattan — del posto .
this is near the top of the icefall .
and guess what — they solved the problem .
and i believed i could do it .
and i was permanently hooked .
but out there , those lowest of the lows are so often contrasted with the highest of the highs .
it guides us how to feel .
i really got close to design again .
india has the right institutional conditions for economic growth , whereas china is still struggling with political reforms .
it &apos;s clearly undisturbed by us .
because think about the teddy bear .
i was as reckless and foolish as only young men can be .
punta espinosa is where i lived for over a year , and we call it uninhabited because there are no people there .
dancers at a street corner — it &apos;s a crowd , a small one , but they can all obviously see what each other can do .
and i said , &quot; &quot; what &apos;s the matter ? &quot; &quot; and she said , &quot; &quot; why can &apos;t i save e.t. ? why can &apos;t i come ? &quot; &quot; and then all of a sudden i realized : they weren &apos;t children ; they were boys — all boys .
and when you think about it , this makes a lot of sense , that using specialized physical objects would help people use an interface more easily .
( laughter ) eh : and the sitcom jewish mother is born , right there .
by now , you might have sort of lost perspective on how large this cube of brain tissue actually is .
case in point : i came up here and — ( clicking ) — they wouldn &apos;t tell me where the lectern was .
look , it &apos;s been a rough election year , a reminder that people with my immigration history could be removed at the whim of a leader .
i &apos;m an archeological geneticist at the center for evolutionary medicine at the university of zurich , and i study the origins and evolution of human health and disease by conducting genetic research on the skeletal and mummified remains of ancient humans .
the choices don &apos;t make sense , because it &apos;s the wrong question .
and there was no argument , because it &apos;s incentive .
just wait over there .
and everybody &apos;s dogs at home have an autobiographical self to a certain degree .
we introduced our first microcredit program in 1975 , and the women who organized it said , &quot; &quot; we only want to lend to women who practice family planning .
and this is how they see the world .
sometimes a single threat can polarize us , as we saw .
i think that can be changed by building combinatorial vaccines in advance .
that &apos;s my camera lens . the first one — the one i shot my bob dylan film with 35 years ago .
and we &apos;d do that by building fences , using motorbikes and horses , and the sheep would make their way all the way back to the shearing shed for the different seasons .
she lives in a little worker &apos;s camp right next to the road , and she wanted a different lot on things .
( laughter ) so , that &apos;s going to look pretty shabby now .
that &apos;s a huge number , and what does that mean ?
it tells you if you have h5n1 .
and i &apos;m going to talk about experiments that involve actually using this brain science , first of all to understand how it contributes to the loss of function as we age .
our heritage is much more than our collective memory — it &apos;s our collective treasure .
my american colleagues have told me i &apos;ve got to call it a router , so that everyone here understands — ( laughter ) — but nonetheless , here is the device .
i was the guy beaten up bloody every week in the boys &apos; room , until one teacher saved my life .
now , if we can learn those values from at least some influences on the right , if we can take them and incorporate them , maybe we could do a little trade .
there &apos;s an obvious objection .
we have several teams in the main part of afghanistan .
clearly , there are wrongs that need to be righted .
i left , and i became a social entrepreneur , and i set up an organization with mark shand called elephant family , which deals with asian elephant conservation .
now , our foundation , for the last nine years , has invested in this .
a message to the entertainment industry and to the press : on the whole , you &apos;ve done a wonderful job fighting stigma and prejudice of many kinds .
beliefs could be : where are my arms in space ?
boyd varty : well thanks , pat .
it was too late for me , but maybe i could help someone else , someone who could use the information .
but it turns out this is just a reminder that , although this is a lot of fun , when you interpret these graphs , you have to be very careful , and you have to adopt the base standards in the sciences .
they are happy . they don &apos;t have problems .
so it turns out that propulsion isn &apos;t really the problem .
( arabic ) omer by brother , i will always love you .
no way , that &apos;s impossible ! no no no no no ! that &apos;s not possible . &quot; &quot; till finally one prince said , &quot; princess , i accept , you have defeated me . &quot;
i wish they would just go away .
the first relates to the idea of civic education .
and if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing , your hands are bleeding in no time .
here &apos;s the girlfriend .
that compassion is actually an inherent human quality .
it &apos;s been estimated that two thirds of the melodies dylan used in his early songs were borrowed .
they have no trouble telling us what art is about .
in this century , scientists may learn to awaken the power of artificial intelligence .
when you ask that question , you think people must be happier in california if , say , you live in ohio .
and we must rebuild these forests .
but we can also store energy using superconductors , because we have no dissipation .
so , i propose the following — of course , the astronomer wouldn &apos;t like the idea — but let &apos;s turn the hubble telescope upside down .
and of course , in italy where — i mean , italians always seem to know where to find their pleasure — they &apos;ve launched an official slow sex movement .
these changes and others like them changed the way that portlanders live , and their vehicle-miles traveled per day , the amount that each person drives , actually peaked in 1996 , has been dropping ever since , and they now drive 20 percent less than the rest of the country .
this is actually from the klondike gold rush . this is the white pass trail .
so , steven is sharing this story , but he is not alone .
and it &apos;s a really poor area .
we then grow the cells outside the body , take the scaffold , coat the scaffold with the cells — the patient &apos;s own cells , two different cell types .
i learned this firsthand with my next adventure .
and none of those problems could i have dealt with , but i have a really bright research team .
today , we &apos;ve got great technology : we have gps .
&quot; &quot; my grandfather worked at this factory .
and that &apos;s the reason i beat him , actually , because i respected him .
you can have a succession of changes .
in this example , although the mammogram found one tumor , we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors — one is small as three millimeters .
it &apos;s not really what we do , is it , when we &apos;re at our best ?
sandy was a reminder of how such an illusion can shatter .
if you chase a girl , the girl won &apos;t like you .
one day she said to me , &quot; &quot; my wish is to finish college and be able to support my children . &quot; &quot; she &apos;s at a place where she can &apos;t find money to go to school .
i just sat there and listened .
perhaps god is testing us : testing our charity , or our faith .
and this is all within our reach pretty easily .
they also get entangled in fishing gear .
did you know that paris has more mathematicians than any other city in the world ?
kb : thank you so much . ca : thank you , khalida . ( applause )
i want you to think about them as architectural objects , so what they are , are just pure lines .
we were fortunate , because in a way our building was future-proofed .
that was , of course , by le corbusier , the famous architect .
and another thing i would say is that girls &apos; voices and women &apos;s voices are beautiful , they are there , but we cannot do this alone .
we pioneered all sorts of new , flexible work methods : job shares , profit-sharing , and eventually , co-ownership when i took a quarter of the company into the hands of the staff at no cost to anyone but me .
he said , &quot; &quot; go on , milo . squash it . &quot; &quot; what we &apos;re using there is , we &apos;re using something , a piece of technology called tellme .
and was it even worthwhile to donate ?
we replaced these cars with trees , using which now we can make multi-layered forests .
but they do send a message to boys , that they are not , the boys are not really the target audience .
if i have a gps and a camera in my car , i have a pretty precise idea of where i am and how fast i &apos;m going .
my preconception of bilbao was this wonderful building , you go inside and there &apos;d be extraordinary spaces .
when they swarm and chase you down the block to shoot you , a little bit less so .
and so , up to 30 percent of our land and our space is used storing these hunks of steel .
it grows every year .
at night , i &apos;m in a submarine , i have force-feedback gloves , and i could delicately set up a lab in the front of my submarine , where the squishy robot fingers are delicately collecting and putting things in jars , and we can conduct our research .
so the word &quot; &quot; silhouette &quot; &quot; comes from a minister of finance , etienne de silhouette .
you rotate around the center of the circle , the circle remains unchanged .
nobody would have said 50 years ago that apartheid would have gone in 1990 , or that the berlin wall would have fallen at the turn of the &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s , or that polio could be eradicated , or perhaps 60 years ago , nobody would have said a man could gone to the moon .
instead , we believe you need to be inspired by biology .
i need to be in class because i need to graduate . &quot; &quot; so he knew that i was not going to let him be a victim of his circumstance , but we were going to push forward and keep moving on .
that gives you an idea of where they have people .
the next morning , two officers came to my home and reported that mike &apos;s car was down at the bridge .
it told us we were using twice as much energy as our neighbors . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) &quot; &quot; and for the last two weeks , all we can think about , talk about , and even argue about , is what we should be doing to save energy .
on a thursday morning in july 2005 , the bomber and i , unknowingly , boarded the same train carriage at the same time , standing , apparently , just feet apart .
put simply , in a room full of randomly selected people , i &apos;m a maths genius .
and so , we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all beings .
i was listed on the online biography that said i was a design missionary .
this is a map of stockholm , my hometown .
and from that comes the internet .
( laughter ) lp : i &apos;d just like to end off by just saying this : it took me four months again to feel my hands .
( laughter ) and yogi berra used to say , of course , that it &apos;s very tough to make predictions , especially about the future . ( laughter )
we all very matter of factly bought a pair of pants , put them on and said , &quot; &quot; thank you . that &apos;s exactly what i needed today , &quot; &quot; and then exited without revealing what had happened and went in all different directions .
similarly , infrastructure — for a long time , infrastructure was not a priority .
but you have to remember that these trees are literally bigger than whales , and what that means is that they &apos;re impossible to understand just by walking on the ground below them .
i know this , that &apos;s why love can be defined in a more accurate way as the desire of being desired .
we spotlighted many famous people such as lionel messi , the most famous soccer player in the world .
( laughter ) they were memorizing hundreds of random numbers , looking at them just once .
and it &apos;s known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus , they maybe lose the ability to recognize faces .
it &apos;s in six languages , and you can tell your own story about what happened to you on that day .
ok , that &apos;s practically everybody .
design done . ( laughter ) and they went for it ! ( laughter ) author liked it , publisher liked it , and that is how the book went out into the world , and it was really fun to see people reading this on the subway and walking around with it and what have you , and they all sort of looked like they were crazy . ( laughter )
we have no idea of what the supply chain is for those clinics .
and then i had a 15-hour surgery in which my surgeon , dr. john healey at memorial sloan-kettering hospital in new york , took out my left femur and replaced it with titanium .
so while this is a very small story , we hope that it represents a step in the right direction for the future of rural communities and for the future of public education and hopefully also for the future of design .
and with just a magnifying glass , he transcribed as much of the text as he could .
and ramos told wald , according to witnesses , &quot; i &apos;m not going to leave you . &quot;
he said what scientists do when a paradigm fails is , guess what — they carry on as if nothing had happened .
experts agree that it &apos;s impossible to farm cows for every inhabitant on this planet .
we observe facial expressions , body language , and we can intuit feelings and emotions from our dialogue with one another .
so she said , &quot; &quot; everybody in palestine , in where ? israel ?
they would just get frustrated with you .
most people long to overcome pettiness and become part of something larger .
i believe that , ultimately , we can overcome the digitally empowered networks of extremism , demagoguery and hate .
at work , we &apos;re so busy communicating that we often don &apos;t have time to think , we don &apos;t have time to talk , about the things that really matter .
there are some things that helped me , i think , be better than i would have been .
the main point of all this for me is , we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species .

every day now for 18 years — every single day — i &apos;ve had to try to decide the combinations and mixtures of chemicals , and try to get them , to stay alive .
on march 14 , this year , i posted this poster on facebook .
that &apos;s part of you up there .
here in 2009 , you know , it &apos;s not an easy thing to be a forest ecologist , gripping ourselves with these kinds of questions and trying to figure out how we can answer them .
fabulous , lots of people talk about this .
let &apos;s dive , let &apos;s reach out the reality we live in every day , and look carefully at it , since that &apos;s what we need .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples .
you have a series of buttons . you actually choose your lift music .
at one point , it went , &quot; &quot; guys and dolls : the musical , &quot; &quot; &quot; last tango in paris , &quot; &quot; diary of a wimpy kid , &quot; &quot; porn star : legend of ron jeremy . &quot;
ag : well , i don &apos;t think i would write any message .
i &apos;ve got , you know , this enormous balloon above me , it &apos;s the biggest parachute ever , why not use it ?
what is a bird ?
( music ) ( applause ) ( applause ) ( music ) ( applause ) ( music ) ( applause ) chris anderson : you guys were amazing .
the saudi blogger raif badawi has been jailed and flogged for insulting islam and criticizing the saudi regime on his blog .
they typically make the best out of their conditions , and try to make their spaces look nice and homey , or at least up until as far as they can reach .
let &apos;s see if we can understand glucose response .
you know we have up to five tastes , three of them sustain us .
we don &apos;t have to be subjected as second , but they have to know that women , as we are in this room , we are not just women , we are not just girls , we are extraordinary .
thank you very much .
abuse thrives only in silence .
we collaborated with the local community and built , out of recycled materials of their own , this fantastical floating platform that gently moved in the ocean as we watched films from the british film archive , &#91; 1903 &#93; &quot; &quot; alice in wonderland , &quot; &quot; for example .
friends , this has never happened , where everybody in the prison studies .
it &apos;s not going to happen , you know , in one year , but it &apos;s an important , deeply economic and cultural change that happens through children .
and poets , like other artists , play with those intuitive understandings .
pm : so how do we get this balance we &apos;re looking for , then , in the world ?
he set an ambitious goal : he wanted kenya to be ranked top 50 in this world bank ranking .
now , why do i say that ?
but now it &apos;s not falling , because there , with help from pepfar , it &apos;s working with treatment . and people are not dying .
and i &apos;m talking about the very end .
for the first time ever , african pain and african aspiration has the ability to be witnessed by those who can empathize with it the most : other africans .
more than 700,000 children in the united states aged 18 and under begin smoking every year .
this guy thought in the same way i did .
and particularly , how can it lead to the creation of buildings which consume less energy , create less pollution and are more socially responsible ?
it had gone through , like , five or six families , and it was just a big thing for us , and we found actually an old picture of somebody and their family years ago .
i came back home , told my mother , &quot; i &apos;d like to live and work in a village . &quot;
so to combat this , we tether ourselves with science .
that led us to think that maybe people with strong motivations and strong goals to exercise might actually see the finish line as closer than people who have weaker motivations .
any of those can be opened up .
somebody dance ! come on !
it &apos;d be lousy not to get a job one is qualified for , but it would triple suck if it was because of stack overflow in some subroutine .
so , the last thing we did , very quickly , is i took all those wish balloons — there were 117 interviews , 117 wishes — and i brought them up to a place called dochula , which is a mountain pass in bhutan , at 10,300 feet , one of the more sacred places in bhutan .
and i &apos;m also proud to announce that you &apos;re getting a sneak preview — on friday we &apos;re going to announce that we &apos;re actually forming a team to develop a system to grow plants on the moon , which is going to be pretty fun .
and then my teacher looks at me sort of concerned about halfway through the class and says , &quot; &quot; are you feeling ok ? &quot; &quot; i &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; are you kidding ? am i feeling ok ?
what i &apos;ve learned is that the most effective people and teams in any domain do something we can all emulate .
but as we enter , the ground drops below us and our perception shifts , where we realize that these columns evoke the lynchings , which happened in the public square .
you &apos;ve got the red-hat triathletes over there .
let me just give you an example from a recent study that we conducted . we asked participants to just simply give us their opinion of a variety of social groups , and we either made the room smell gross or not .
( laughter ) but of course , it &apos;s 2016 , so there &apos;s an app for that . ( laughter )
millions of in-the-ear hearing aids are already 3d printed today .
you know , she eats small portions .
i think we &apos;d all be pretty comfortable with this guy doing it .
but there has been a huge amount of progress .
so in a stage two culture — and we find these in all sorts of different places — you find them , in fact , in the best organizations in the world .
the first since this man , franklin delano roosevelt , who began his own unprecedented journey way back at his own first election , way back in a simpler time , way back in 1932 — ( laughter ) the year alberto giacometti ( laughter ) made &quot; &quot; the palace at four in the morning . &quot; &quot; the year , let &apos;s remember , that this voice , now departed , first came a-cryin &apos; into this big old crazy world of ours .
and he still is holding this line .
thank you very much .
so , i &apos;m pretty pleased with it all .
desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert , and this happens only when we create too much bare ground .
after the final &quot; &quot; no &quot; &quot; comes a &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; when any great moral challenge is ultimately resolved into a binary choice between what is right and what is wrong , the outcome is fore-ordained because of who we are as human beings .
wouldn &apos;t it be better , or more informative , or more useful , if instead we could look at the view like this .
and i really wanted to share with you a very special moment of my life and the history of the city of rio .
it may be the next rainforest , in terms of pharmaceuticals .
what do men have to do with gender equality ?
in fact , most of the rights that we have today in this country — as women , as minorities , as workers , as people of different sexual orientations and citizens concerned with the environment — these rights weren &apos;t handed to us .
is the destruction of the world inevitable ? should i have children ?
and if you remember that — raise your hands if you could .
&#91; a good conversation is like a miniskirt ; short enough to retain interest , but long enough to cover the subject . — my sister &#93; ( laughter ) ( applause ) all of this boils down to the same basic concept , and it is this one : be interested in other people .
these are really great things .
the rest of the world might casually encourage or even expect some sort of north korean spring , but i don &apos;t want you to do anything risky , because i know in your world , someone is always watching .
will this solve the problem ? will economics solve everything ?
but it &apos;s just not practical .
so those who are &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; raise your hand . &quot; &quot; for . &quot; &quot; okay , hands down .
the higher education system failed patrick , debbie and wael , exactly as it is failing millions of potential students , millions that graduate high school , millions that are qualified for higher education , millions that want to study yet cannot access for various reasons .
those fossil fuels have built our civilization .
and so , we wanted to find out might we be able to use hydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold , and we wanted to see whether we could reproduce this skier in a mammal .
and that changes everything .
because now it &apos;s become socially not acceptable not to show up to support your children at the manchester craftsmen &apos;s guild because people think you &apos;re bad parents .
this misinformation destroyed the credibility of the source , and it &apos;s harmed the credibility of other reliable and trustworthy sources .
one that i &apos;ll highlight here is changing the patient &apos;s name .
but today , the way i want you to understand a black hole , for the proof of a black hole , is to think of it as an object whose mass is confined to zero volume .
there &apos;s something else in that .
in 2003 , the whitney mounted a retrospective of our work that featured a lot of this work from the &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s .
but donna &apos;s biggest supporter came from an unexpected place .
now as you &apos;re reading , however , you will be maybe surprised that you will quickly become numb to the numbers of deaths , because you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers of faceless , nameless dead people .
and the reasons for their absence are given in my text panel .
it helps them suggest books for me to read or movies for my family to watch or friends for us to connect with .
how many of you use facebook photos , google photos , instagram ?
you work on the front lines . and you &apos;ve seen the best and the worst that human beings can do for one another and to one another .
so after dinner , the orchestra started to play , and the guests burst into song , and all of a sudden , taft was surprised with the presentation of a gift from a group of local supporters , and this was a stuffed opossum toy , all beady-eyed and bald-eared , and it was a new product they were putting forward to be the william taft presidency &apos;s answer to teddy roosevelt &apos;s teddy bear .
i &apos;m going to ask you to go ahead and put a blindfold on .
they had none of that .
and all i &apos;m going to try and prove to you with these slides is that i do just very straight stuff .
it &apos;s not telling the parents , &quot; &quot; if you see paralysis , take your child to the doctor or get your child vaccinated . &quot; &quot; we have a problem with marketing in the donor community .
was this a good idea ?
this is gen9 gene assembler , and so right now when you try to print a gene , what you do is somebody in a factory with pipettes puts the thing together by hand , you have one error per 100 base pairs , and it takes a long time and costs a lot of money .
and so while other kids were bbm-ing their parents , i was literally waiting by the mailbox to get a letter from home to see how the weekend had gone , which was a little frustrating when grandma was in the hospital , but i was just looking for some sort of scribble , some unkempt cursive from my mother .
if it has a subject , the subject is adolescence .
in my book i talked about the fact that 72 percent of people trust what other people say about a brand or a company , versus 15 percent on advertising .
let &apos;s start with the world of 1945 .
first of all , was that dance , even though it hadn &apos;t been offered to her , was her life .
here &apos;s the story i was telling : the gods up there , there were two people .
so it &apos;s the same way , like those action video games have a number of ingredients that are actually really powerful for brain plasticity , learning , attention , vision , etc . , and so we need and we &apos;re working on understanding what are those active ingredients so that we can really then leverage them to deliver better games , either for education or for rehabilitation of patients .
and i said , &quot; &quot; go read it . &quot; &quot; and they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; oh , that one wasn &apos;t so awesome . &quot; &quot; and then we went to another one — it didn &apos;t have great visuals , but it had great information — and spent an hour talking about the learning process , because it wasn &apos;t about whether or not it was perfect , or whether or not it was what i could create .
and then at my worst moments : why did i make such a stupid mistake ?
all the things that make a great city successful and all the things that make a great city stimulating — they were all on display there on those streets .
if i &apos;m going to teach my daughter about electronics , i &apos;m not going to give her a soldering iron .
( laughter ) ( applause ) and because it &apos;s so badass , those flags and crosses are found throughout amsterdam , just like chicago , they &apos;re used .
but race is a bad proxy .
so i would say , coquo ergo sum : i cook , therefore i am .
but it actually turns out that your cells sit in this mesh of complicated fibers , proteins and sugars known as the extracellular matrix .
so , how do you do imitation ? why is imitation important ?
they don &apos;t have the frontal cortex .
so , in soap , fatty acids made from boiling pork bone fat are used as a hardening agent , but also for giving it a pearl-like effect .
and the good news is , nine years later , you can see improvements in quality and equity .
and in my case , as i was about five years old , this meant asking my mum .
finally , four great industrial sectors combined .
so what do you do when everything is out there ?
it &apos;s perfect for that particular context .
you know , they might have a solution .
so this is a sleeping baby , and under its nose , we &apos;ve put a clean glass rod .
( laughter ) powerful opponents are not going to give people what they want just because they asked nicely ...
dr : well the truth of the matter is , post-september 11th , i felt myself in the role originally — first of all as someone who lives in tribeca and whose neighborhood was devastated , and as someone who works less than a mile from there — that i was in the role of forcing 100 people who work with me in my firm , to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm about creating the places we had been creating .
those are the two choices we have . i know which future i would rather be living in .
here you have sub-saharan africa , south asia , east asia , arab states , east europe , latin america , and oecd .
( laughter ) and finally , it &apos;s okay for the speaker — that &apos;s the good news — to fake intellectual capacity .
and this is where we &apos;re actually going .
and when i would go back to swaziland , i would be constantly confronted by how very non-swazi i was becoming .
( laughter ) remember this ?
i &apos;m going to say almost not at all .
if we zoom in on this photograph right here , we can see it &apos;s a really nice photograph to have of her , because she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the same time to get a nice image of her facial texture .
and we can all make that choice .
instead , innovation , if you remember , some of you may have read the famous economist schumpeter , he said , &quot; &quot; innovation is novelty in how value is created and distributed . &quot; &quot; it could be new products and services , but it could also be new ways of producing products .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been working on the last couple of years , and that &apos;s what we need to be working on together — rethinking everything from the ground up , with a holistic view across the value chain , connecting all these things across the globe , alongside great entrepreneurs that are willing to share a collective vision .
and that it wasn &apos;t until 2009 , when president obama signed off on a surge , that we finally had , in the words of secretary clinton , &quot; the strategy , the leadership and the resources . &quot;
another answer might be , well , it came from a sort of lone genius working in his garage , who , working away on different kinds of bikes , comes up with a bike out of thin air .
but mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when i am one of the biggest beneficiaries .
there is so many things to do ; it &apos;s so fresh .
some of our kids started talking with their parents , others with their teachers , or with their friends .
and like a fool , i didn &apos;t go to the ceremony because i didn &apos;t think we were going to win .
because , after all , in that framework , between page one and 300 , you have to answer this question of why things happen , how things happen , in what order they happen . what are the influences ?
why ? i think there are three reasons , two long-term ones and the trigger .
luckily now things have changed because i came to discover the truth .
my friend red maxwell has spent the last 10 years fighting against juvenile diabetes .
but even with that , there still was another big hurdle , and that actually brings us back to the mapping of the human genome , because we &apos;re all different .
because physics doesn &apos;t give a damn about your gender .
so i too got one of those baby monitors so that i could see my daughter when she was asleep .
and so if language really is the solution to the crisis of visual theft , if language really is the conduit of our cooperation , the technology that our species derived to promote the free flow and exchange of ideas , in our modern world , we confront a question .
in the end , what really makes a government healthy is when healthy cells — that &apos;s you and i — get to the ground , roll up our sleeves , refuse to be helpless and believe that sometimes , all it takes is for us to create some space for healthy cells to grow and thrive .
it uses lots of pesticides , lots of fertilizer , lots of water .
i could relate to this homo erectus skeleton very well , because i was the same age that he was when he died .
this kind , intelligent young man from new jersey had just committed suicide .
and whenever we saw a flock of birds that had electronic communication , we thought , &apos; probably has something to do with the americans . &apos; &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; yeah .
this was really an extraordinary advance , because although these cells are not human embryonic stem cells , which still remain the gold standard , they are terrific to use for modeling disease and potentially for drug discovery .
when we face these crises , we have kept the potential , the huge potential of our society out of this process , and we are closing in on ourselves in politics , and i think we need to change that , to really find new participatory ways using the great capabilities that now exist even in technology but not only in technology , the minds that we have , and i think we can find solutions which are much better , but we have to be open .
for instance , you could find women who feel &quot; &quot; addicted &quot; &quot; in their 20s when it was cloudy in bangladesh .
the purple-painters and the green-painters fight over who &apos;s going to paint that bit behind the curtain ? no .
so even as we worry about it , we have allowed it to go on in this country — much different in europe — without any regulation , and even without any identification on the package .
we &apos;re all , under certain circumstances , willfully blind .
and they face a daily struggle with social stigma , with family despair , and with religious fire and brimstone .
there are too many people that think that high-technology medicine is going to keep them , save them , from overeating , from eating a lot of fast foods , from not getting any exercise .
it &apos;s getting more oxygen to your brain .
we insist on faith in the future and in each other .
how is technology changing love ?
this is another one from the woods .
imagine that was lake huron .
shouldn &apos;t you be doing something about this ? why haven &apos;t you had it removed ? &quot; &quot; and other children in curiosity come up and poke the lesion , because — a natural curiosity .
couldn &apos;t find a shred of evidence .
this is called hooked on a feeling : the pursuit of happiness and human design .
the icelandic prime minister had to resign .
but from about the age of five , i was aware that i didn &apos;t fit .
these are indicators that give you a much better read about the socioeconomic development of a country .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
whatever they could do , the earth &apos;s resilience would soon heal human activities .
the extreme might be in italy where , again , there &apos;s kind of some type of control over what &apos;s happening in the environment is very evident , even in the way that they sell and distribute periodicals .
i want to introduce you to an amazing woman .
and i asked her if she loved her baby .
can you possibly help ? &quot; &quot; let me describe haryana a little bit to you .
over the course of human history , starvation has been a much bigger problem than overeating .
before , i was an architect , and my grandmother asked me once , &quot; what are you doing for a living ? &quot;
you &apos;re looking at brine pools formed by salt diapirs .
just using a checklist requires you to embrace different values from the ones we &apos;ve had , like humility , discipline , teamwork .
i wasn &apos;t quite sure how to answer the question .
in america , we &apos;re all familiar with the term &quot; &quot; the american dream . &quot; &quot; i think it &apos;s time , across the world , that we &apos;re able to think also of something we might also call a dream for all humankind .
it &apos;s been there for three days , and it &apos;s laying on its back .
in fact , they raised more than 13,000 dollars to reward him for this discovery , raising a vital discussion in the technology industry about how we come up with incentives for hackers to do the right thing .
we make a practice of ignoring those limitations .
this is the netherlands , 2011 .
police took this blurry photo of me holding leaflets as evidence .
seventy percent — it &apos;s unbelievable .
if the breast is less than 25 percent dense , that &apos;s called fatty-replaced .
there must be hundreds of thousands of blind people who have these hallucinations , but are too scared to mention them .
and richard meier , who was one of my teachers , kept coming over to my desk to give me criticism , and he would say , &quot; &quot; bill , you &apos;ve got to understand- — solar energy has nothing to do with architecture . &quot; &quot; i guess he didn &apos;t read vitruvius .
you can find it on the east coast as well as the west coast , and often the symbols are very well preserved , so each of these symbols has four bits — it &apos;s a four-bit binary word — you draw these lines in the sand randomly , and then you count off , and if it &apos;s an odd number , you put down one stroke , and if it &apos;s an even number , you put down two strokes .
if our airplane is too heavy , if the pilot wastes energy , we &apos;ll never make it through the night .
( laughter ) if you do that , you might think , &quot; &quot; oh great . i &apos;m going to do my best work when i &apos;m in my 20s . &quot; &quot; but guess what , nobody will really care . ( laughter )
people died , including the crew of apollo 1 .
&quot; &quot; find it yourself , &quot; &quot; they said .
in fact , everybody in this room probably , especially if you picked up your bag — some of you , i know , didn &apos;t pick up your bags — but if you picked up your bag , everybody in this room has got in their pocket , or back in their room , something that 350 years ago , kings would have gone to war to have .
and this is a place where people not only reach age 100 , they do so with extraordinary vigor .
dh : now obviously , this is not something we do on our regular show ; it &apos;s something we just kind of learned for this , so we &apos;re going to try . but can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs ?
it reminded me a lot of the talk we heard this morning , about this operating room machinery that was designed specifically for africa .
so we &apos;re in the process of helping them design deep-well , low-cost manual pumps in order for these people who have a quarter acre of land to be able to grow crops in the off-season .
the best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you and try and — i want to get more on this that we could share along with the talk.as : wonderful .
so , that &apos;s an empty parka jacket .
and i could list more .
i was in a doctor &apos;s office last cat scan , and there was a reader &apos;s digest , october 2002 .
well , i actually don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to be the case .
but i really think this is a phenomenon that can inspire us .
they have come up with , in a sense , a different method for organizing activity .
the night before a match i &apos;m very nervous .
and because kuznets &apos; invention was found to be so useful , it spread around the world .
and just like the strings on a violin , they can vibrate in different patterns producing different musical notes .
and what we learned is cesar &apos;s work is far too good to explain in the new york times magazine .
this emerging economy really is helping the revival of the world economy .
and i think in life it should be exactly like this .
physicists and chemists have had nearly a century of trying to get used to this weirdness .
for me , this is about exploring human limits , about exploring the limits of physiology , of psychology and of technology . they &apos;re the things that excite me .
they don &apos;t usually get significant access to assistance .
you had to have quite a flair for the dramatic , and be really , really quick .
75 percent of people admit doing private conversations from work on their mobile phones .
thank you very much .
lighting in practice is placing lights inside this three-dimensional world .
which one of these guys am i actually related to ?
similarly , there &apos;s the work of people like marti guixe that tries to involve you in a way that is really about making everything pass through your mouth so that you learn from your mistakes or from your taste , orally .
so there was always going to be a tension within that .
mental note to the liberators : throwaway plastics take a lot of space and don &apos;t biodegrade .
rajiv suffers from a mental illness .
but i do think that being involved in the genesis of this really puts me and my colleagues in a position of responsibility .
but then , in the &apos; 90s , something began to unravel .
it &apos;s also hot , huge and unruly , made up of 17,000 islands , where people speak close to a thousand languages .
you probably haven &apos;t seen anything like this out there .
we have 31 brigades in the u.s.
i still love being close to someone reading to me .
and what &apos;s fantastic is that this symbol is not a thing , it &apos;s not an image , it &apos;s not an artifact , actually it &apos;s a space , and it &apos;s kind of just defined by a line of buildings on either side .
and yes , you also interact using natural gestures , both hands , etc .
we &apos;re using whatever leverage we have to bring them to the table .
we called people for help , and nobody came .
it &apos;s the indication that it &apos;s the best foie gras .
then another year goes by .
now , tonya also talked about working with a mentor , and this is really important to talk about , because if organizations , talent and performance systems aren &apos;t giving people in general information about the importance of business , strategic and financial acumen , how are men getting to the top ?
a friend of mine , an indian friend of mine , went to his grandfather when he was very young , a child , and said to him , &quot; i want to talk to you about religion , &quot; and his grandfather said , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re too young .
well here &apos;s how we &apos;re going to do it .
could you give me a flight ? because we &apos;re going to go see him . &quot; &quot; and of course , we went and saw him and it was amazing .
so , rather than have it fight or do industrial work , we decided to build a planter , put the robot into the center of it , and we called it the telegarden .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to leave you with this final thought .
in britain , 63 percent of all men who come out of short sentences from prison re-offend again within a year .
and these telescopes , among other things , they &apos;re being used to study how the expansion of the universe is changing with time .
chinese is always cheating , right ?
the matter around the star is dragged around , and some energy from that rotation is transferred to that matter and the magnetic field is increased even further .
one in nine people in the world suffers from undernourishment .
and that &apos;s the sad part .
both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise , and both of them , because they &apos;re manufacturers , create jobs directly , and create incomes indirectly , because they &apos;re in the malaria sector , and africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year because of malaria .
dm : and now i &apos;ll attach the filter to the drums , so i can control the effect live . video : ( music )
so they &apos;ve managed to both restore the local ecology and the local economy at the same time .
and if you look at the light , it is illuminating as you would expect .
matt has also helped me to set up an organization that i &apos;m working with that has the name taken from the title of a book i wrote , &quot; the life you can save , &quot; which is trying to change our culture so that more people think that if we &apos;re going to live an ethical life , it &apos;s not enough just to follow the thou-shalt-nots and not cheat , steal , maim , kill , but that if we have enough , we have to share some of that with people who have so little .
our tissues all have very different abilities to regenerate , and here we see poor prometheus , who made a rather tricky career choice and was punished by the greek gods .
now the reason we did this is that humans are not very good at picking random words .
i sent nick off . nick came back .
it was kind of like being an astronaut , because we were getting to see things and go places that no one had ever seen or gone to before .
sanghamitra didn &apos;t start life as a leader of an ngo , she started her career as university professor , teaching english literature .
so we wanted to change the way that students approach technology , to create a more convivial and social space that was more engaging , more accessible , and also to increase the ability for teachers to use these spaces for technology-based instruction .
it &apos;s only 10 years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free-living organism , that of haemophilus influenzae .
she &apos;s in the studio with him for a long time .
( laughter ) but homage to singapore .
i was born in israel to a right-wing family , and as long as i remember myself , i wanted to join the israeli army to serve my country and prove what i believed was our right for the whole land .
our circumstances are different , but you &apos;re the same as us .
the end of the cold war and the disintegration of the soviet union .
this is fascinating . you probably know , some of you , that cells are continually renewed . you can see it in skin and this kind of stuff .
the more time i spent around these people and saw this problem , i thought , what if we could create a community , a place where people could feel like they belonged and that it was ok to do things differently , to take the road less traveled , where that was encouraged , and inspire people to change ?
i think we &apos;ve all read the grimms &apos; fairy tales , which are , indeed , very grim .
maybe we just follow our gut .
and second , it gives us the opportunity to understand how these supermassive black holes interact with their environment , and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution of the galaxies which they reside in .
my point is here , people have a choice — just like the indian lady could wear her sari or the japanese woman could wear her kimono .
they have the same share that we have .
mr : we used &quot; &quot; mary had a little lamb &quot; &quot; because those are said to be the first words that thomas edison spoke into his phonograph in 1877 .
if any — those of you who are older in the audience know that when i was a child we understood that a child born with a cleft palate was born with what we called mental retardation .
rl : so there are , when our legitimate foreign intelligence targets of the type that i described before , use the global telecommunications system as their communications methodology , and they do , because it &apos;s a great system , it &apos;s the most complex system ever devised by man , and it is a wonder , and lots of folks in the room there are responsible for the creation and enhancement of that , and it &apos;s just a wonderful thing .
so it turns out that being paid less and praised less has its upsides — for society at least .
in about four months of release , we &apos;ve brought that population of mosquitos — in most cases we &apos;re dealing with villages here of about 2,000 , 3,000 people , that sort of size , starting small — we &apos;ve taken that mosquito population down by about 85 percent in about four months .
( applause ) how about that ? how about we create a better world for nothing ?
and that &apos;s johnny depp &apos;s shoulder .
and with the right kind of help , maybe one day i could get better .
the existential and social and political impact an artist has on his nation &apos;s development of cultural identity is very important .
at the moment , they &apos;re incarcerated .
well , it &apos;s not . &quot; &quot; e.t. &quot; &quot; is about divorce . &quot; &quot; e.t. &quot; &quot; is about a heartbroken , divorce-crippled family , and ultimately , this kid who can &apos;t find his way .
that &apos;s an inconvenience compared to having both of them gone . &quot; &quot; i got a day job , and my nights and weekends are already filled up with things like , let &apos;s supply water to the world , and power to the world , and educate all the kids , which , chris , i will not talk about . i don &apos;t need another mission .
once it &apos;s perceived , and someone brings it into their own mind , then there &apos;s a cycle that has been completed .
one death every 20 seconds .
we &apos;re trying to make sure that clinicians , and therefore their systems that they work in have the ability , the confidence to address the problems in the living and working conditions in our lives .
so we &apos;ve started roundtables where we bring together the entire value chain , from producers all the way to the retailers and brands .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re all avid &quot; &quot; american idol &quot; &quot; watchers .
( laughter ) we &apos;ll loop around here in just a second , and you &apos;ll see another one .
do you think that your discussion may serve as a blueprint for other fields ?
it &apos;s got a fan , it &apos;s got headlights for warmth , it &apos;s got door chimes for alarm — it runs off a car battery .
one of the problems , when you get too much chatter , it &apos;s hard to process all the packets , so you have to prioritize , and that &apos;s where the predictive model helps you .
this was after the fall of gaddafi , but before libya turned into full-blown civil war .
the brief is that the bus should use 40 percent less energy .
orchids : there are 20,000 , at least , species of orchids — amazingly , amazingly diverse .
and so we could choose numbers of positions on the face to pull that data from .
so again , memory is the city , memory is the world .
but i want to concentrate on the role of investment in seeking out novelty , the production and consumption of novelty .
the river flows wider than a two-lane road along most of its path .
loose associations involves putting together words that may sound a lot alike but don &apos;t make sense , and if the words get jumbled up enough , it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; word salad . &quot; &quot; contrary to what many people think , schizophrenia is not the same as multiple personality disorder or split personality .
in most parts of the us , the baseline expectation in public is that we maintain a balance between civility and privacy .
now , i hope that mayors do one day rule the world , but , you know , the fact is , we don &apos;t hear any conversation , really , about what is happening in the south .
now , at some point i was in hawaii — i like to hike and surf and do all that weird stuff , and i was making a collage for my ma .
stop looking where you &apos;re going , turn , check your blind spot , and drive down the road without looking where you &apos;re going .
it &apos;s plastic pollution .
and i know you want to look and see if those spots are still there .
growing up , i had a nickname .
so being a mechanical engineer , being at mit and having lots of resources available to me , i thought i &apos;d try to do something about it .
let me tell you a story about a little girl named naghma .
on the last day , we met her majesty the queen of norway , and twitter couldn &apos;t quite handle it .
i &apos;m taking data from the u.n. — it &apos;s the same as the world bank has — on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies .
the logarithmic scale hides the scale of the increase , because this represents trillions-fold increase since the 1890 census .
one hint : it &apos;s not &quot; &quot; l. &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) it could be an &quot; &quot; l , &quot; &quot; of course .
this was incredible ; this is what i wanted to do .
that is , share your lunch .
so for example , in a power plant , when your big steam turbine gets too over speed , you must open relief valves within a millisecond .
it is too expensive for humanity .
remember in your car you have a gas tank .
and many of these muslims further say that their disagreement with the united states is that it , in the past and still in the present , has sided with autocratic rulers in the muslim world in order to promote america &apos;s short-term interests .
the whole world came running , and it was a bizarre experience , because everybody , from everywhere : &quot; &quot; who are they ? what are they ? how many are they ?
you &apos;re reading about this smart stuff , this intelligent dissection of the immune system .
today , we are beginning to understand how to interrupt the progression from early adversity to disease and early death , and 30 years from now , the child who has a high ace score and whose behavioral symptoms go unrecognized , whose asthma management is not connected , and who goes on to develop high blood pressure and early heart disease or cancer will be just as anomalous as a six-month mortality from hiv / aids .
and here we go !
and anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask and cover all of the extraneous parts of their body .
so what needs to be done ?
it is to make a super difference in the performance of others , with whom we are compared .
which side are you on ?
so he went to the church of nativity and brought back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen jesus being born .
a one million-person city per week with 10,000 dollars per family .
it says &quot; &quot; dreams &quot; &quot; at the top .
you know the incident .
this is the case . there are no other cases . &quot; &quot; and in that moment of desire and focus , he can win .
a single four-foot female had 300 million eggs , can carry 300 million eggs in her ovaries — imagine — and they get to be over 10 feet long . imagine what a 10 foot one has .
and the saying goes , we came from dust and will return to dust .
yes , it is . it &apos;s our work — that was a while ago , and it still is my favorite project — of teleconferencing .
and if you turn the lights on , you might periodically see spectacular organisms swim by , because those are the denizens of the deep , the things that live in the deep ocean .
it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; among the school children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o body swayed to music / o brightening glance / how &#91; can we know &#93; the dancer from the dance ? &quot; &quot; and here is merce cunningham , i was fortunate to dance with him when i was younger , and here he is a dancer , and while he is dancing , he is both the dancer and the dance .
and so , you know , for example , with these devices , patients can see simple things like bright lights and high contrast edges , not very much more , so nothing close to normal vision has been possible .
so it &apos;s these two totally different perceptions of my personality .
in other words , everything you need to do in order to remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed by mid-adolescence , whereas in contrast , if you look at the last two gray bars , there &apos;s still a significant improvement in the director condition between mid-adolescence and adulthood , and what this means is that the ability to take into account someone else &apos;s perspective in order to guide ongoing behavior , which is something , by the way , that we do in everyday life all the time , is still developing in mid-to-late adolescence .
this ain &apos;t going to be my last movie .
we are talking here about , oftentimes , very young individuals with spinal cord injuries , that in the prime of their life — 20s , 30s , 40s — hit a wall and the wheelchair &apos;s the only option .
what i will focus on in my talk is why they matter , how they matter , and what we can all do to make sure that they continue to matter in the right ways , that is , how all of us can contribute to developing and honing the skills of local and global leaders to make peace and to make it last .
and i am going to be their help along the way .
in ringing babylonian — it was written in babylonian — he says , &quot; &quot; i am cyrus , king of all the universe , the great king , the powerful king , king of babylon , king of the four quarters of the world . &quot; &quot; they &apos;re not shy of hyperbole as you can see .
i remember having to use vodka — my own vodka — to pickle it because we don &apos;t carry formaldehyde .
and because of this action , that contract was vacated , and now this has sparked a movement in mexico city which is home to one of our partners , code for mexico city .
now , what about what else is going on out there in the universe ?
forget the &apos; 60s . we can change the world .
and then people came .
this year &apos;s h1n1 threat was actually a human , avian , swine mixture that arose in mexico .
even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford .
that &apos;s a lot of pressure . &quot; &quot; i just wanted a blessing , i didn &apos;t want some kind of mandate .
it is with this context that ushahidi came to be .
but i will continue to consider this idea , and i will report back maybe next year .
we treat biotechnology with the same scrutiny we apply to nuclear power plants .
at the same time the city had this need .
between them , these new revenue flows dwarf aid .
then there &apos;s the r-word , proving that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to far too many people .
just two things .
i think it really is transparency and secrecy .
it &apos;s an algorithm that actually allows you to browse the actual museum &apos;s collection using facial recognition .
and i think what it is is i don &apos;t think we have fully come to terms with the meaning of this disaster , with what it meant to witness a hole ripped in our world , with what it meant to watch the contents of the earth gush forth on live tv , 24 hours a day , for months .
we have a video to show you .
( laughter ) td : but it didn &apos;t turn out to be so fun and entertaining , as i thought it would have been .
with our strengths and our minds and spirit , we gather , we form , and we fashion .
and that is the migraine invention that we are talking about and that we are working on .
you need to look at all of the different transportation routes as well .
for nearly a decade afterwards , risen was the subject of a us government investigation in which prosecutors demanded that he testify against one of his alleged sources .
so let me show you how the system works .
there &apos;s a wonderful book called &quot; &quot; crowns &quot; &quot; that &apos;s all these glamour pictures of black women in their church hats .
and they were holding it in their laps .
and making sense of the financial crisis is very , very difficult .
it sort of ended abruptly when she was executed — ( laughter ) — for murdering 600 men . you see , it wasn &apos;t a very good perfume .
whether it &apos;s like the shark in &quot; &quot; jaws &quot; &quot; — if spielberg &apos;s mechanical shark , bruce , had worked , it would not be remotely as scary ; you would have seen it too much .
ten years ago , however , the promise of democracy seemed to be extraordinary . george w. bush stood up in his state of the union address in 2003 and said that democracy was the force that would beat most of the ills of the world . he said , because democratic governments respect their own people and respect their neighbors , freedom will bring peace .
all other species on this planet are gene machines only , they don &apos;t imitate at all well , hardly at all .
and i said , first of all , let me do the calculation on that compound , bottom right , which is related to coumarin , but has an extra pentagon inserted into the molecule .
is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
but it can &apos;t be the fault of somebody like this .
they used to use cardboard boxes years ago and we still use them .
we could rerun that play a lot better now .
i need to rest . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) iranians , sometimes we do two , sometimes we do three .
in kyrgyzstan , just over the last few weeks , unprecedented levels of violence occurred between ethnic kyrgyz and ethnic uzbeks .
but it is just physiology . it &apos;s just in your brain .
however , only recently , due to several technological advancements , we are now able to demonstrate to you quantum levitation and quantum locking .
and it works the exact same way .
this shows the artistic impulses inside us are suppressed , not gone .
so , we have to work out who influences problems .
it &apos;s an extraordinary place .
that punch card system inspired victorian inventor charles babbage to create his analytical engine , the first true programmable computer ever designed .
globalization has been taken to support a neoliberal agenda .
so i look at that question from a bit of a different lens , and i want to know , how can we prevent concussion ?
and people are okay with it .
and so , i want to kind of go through my little story of what i found out .
the one that this step is enabling us to do is coming next .
and this is the same thing you see when people compress video to send : they want to make it very sparse , because that file is smaller . and this is what the retina is doing , and it &apos;s doing it just with the circuitry , and how this network of neurons that are interacting in there , which we &apos;ve captured on the chip .
what is this about ?
but dragonflies — a bit tricky .
over the spanish steps we go .
i find this a particularly apt description of science and how science works — bumbling around in a dark room , bumping into things , trying to figure out what shape this might be , what that might be , there are reports of a cat somewhere around , they may not be reliable , they may be , and so forth and so on .
coke &apos;s been in africa since 1928 , but most of the time they couldn &apos;t reach the distant markets , because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world , which was a large truck rolling down the street .
there &apos;s no breeding pairs left .
so what we found is that the bursts last long enough in order to support wave resonances , which are things caused by exchanges of energy between particles that may have been excited , that depend on the volume .
every time we lead one of these efforts we have to whip ourselves into this imminent threat thing .
and the women decided that they would train not the next generation of girls , because they had grown too old already , but the next generation .
so i get a basic idea as to what you might be about , what you might like , what you might do as a profession , etc . , etc .
you can &apos;t — okay .
and you know , lego — don &apos;t take legos to lego .
did you know the world games happened this year ?
more protein than a hunter &apos;s family could eat before it rotted .
it &apos;s a seductive place , isn &apos;t it ?
he goes down to the basement and starts to check the wiring , and then gradually works his way up to the top of the building , apartment by apartment , checking every television , checking every connection , hoping to find out what this problem is .
what &apos;s happened here , again , almost without our knowing , is our culture has changed .
for any new requirement , you have a dedicated function in charge of aligning engineers against the new requirement .
and this makes us interested in real brains and neuroscience as well , and especially interested in the things that our brains do that are still far superior to the performance of computers .
he said , &quot; &quot; there are only two things that matter in music : what and how .
they &apos;re just information , why would they ?
but if i show you this picture it &apos;s not to tell you how happy we were .
but kiribati is comprised of three groups of islands : the gilbert group on the west , we have the phoenix islands in the middle , and the line islands in the east .
and so we needed grants . and he used significant grants to research , to experiment , to fail , to innovate and try again .
for example , it is counterintuitive to have an illiterate study participant , like celine , sign a lengthy consent form that they are unable to read , let alone understand .
now , as it happens , warren buffett is not only himself a plutocrat , he is one of the most astute observers of that phenomenon , and he has his own favorite number .
well , you are to ride a bicycle , carrying your own weight and also some other weight , so that you can earn the bread for the day .
it extends from the subatomic scale to the farthest reaches of the cosmos .
i was 13 months when they removed my left eye .
the other volunteer who had arrived just before me — let &apos;s call him lex luther — ( laughter ) got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner &apos;s dog .
better said , what the angular resolution is of the things that you see .
&quot; &quot; i don &apos;t need your help , &quot; &quot; he said .
there wasn &apos;t ddt , there wasn &apos;t chloroquines : what do they do ?
the world is changed by our maps of the world .
they &apos;re all coming in at this time , walking across there , just kind of leisurely coming in .
i have and i offer a gospel of doubt .
so &quot; &quot; justin . &quot; &quot; is that the name of the user , their boyfriend , their son ?
they &apos;re driven by this duty and this obligation .
&#91; shit &#93; this is arguably the back end of the design of animals .
so what should we do now ?
and i thought the secret of the site was to make the building of the river , part of the river .
and companies that actually define a true north , things that are nonnegotiable whether times are good , bad , ugly — doesn &apos;t matter .
the stock market has been on a roll , going up as everybody knows , and price-earnings ratios have grown .
he said he &apos;d lived his whole life there by the beach , and that he would rather die there than run .
so if you want to save a village , you do it with a good road , or with a good cell phone connection , and ideally some grid electrical power .
we look around the media , as we see on the news from iraq , afghanistan , sierra leone , and the conflict seems incomprehensible to us .
( laughter ) so even with that caveat , i knew that someone would buy the naming rights .
okay . three stories . here &apos;s the argument .
another new vocabulary word for the brave new world : this is the word &quot; &quot; flupsy &quot; &quot; — it &apos;s short for &quot; &quot; floating upwelling system . &quot; &quot; and this glorious , readily available device is basically a floating raft with an oyster nursery below .
if you &apos;re in india , it &apos;s either muslims or adivasis , our tribals , the naxalites .
these early wasps gave rise to the bees and the ants that have covered the world and changed the biosphere .
now , more europe for me is not simply giving more power to brussels .
when i stood up to speak to my people about god and the tsunami , i had no answers to offer them .
i mean , it &apos;s a hobby of mine that i &apos;ve been indulging in for the last few years , and it all started out with this picture of the american artist , donald baechler i had hanging at home . i had to look at it every day and after a while i just couldn &apos;t stand the mess anymore this guy was looking at all day long .
and he points it at me and gives the moon a break .
the next video is not done by us .
marine organisms do not care about international boundaries ; they move where they will .
all that pink chalky candy has moved to the front of the building and is now being picked into a lot of orders in those pick stations .
so i didn &apos;t have to do any of the cocontracting and all that .
so , looking for answers , i went to catholic mass .
okay . so i &apos;m smiling .
and it has this constant voiceover narrative in your stream of conscious thinking .
remember that we scanned both brains at the same time , so we can ask about time-synced activity in similar or different areas simultaneously , just like if you wanted to study a conversation and you were scanning two people talking to each other and you &apos;d expect common activity in language regions when they &apos;re actually kind of listening and communicating .
and that would be very interesting in the developing world .
we c.t.-scanned all of our bones and built a digital spinosaurus skeleton .
we need — when procurement , supply chain , manufacturing don &apos;t cooperate we need more stock , more inventories , more working capital .
because the killer apps can be downloaded .
what makes us human is that , of all these things that our minds and their minds have , we are the most extreme .
and doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients , but now this will change .
is there a way we can show people food in a way they have not seen it before ?
every storm is different now . &quot; &quot; so , the same extra heat pulls the soil moisture out of the ground and causes these deeper , longer , more pervasive droughts and many of them are underway right now .
that &apos;s the twelfth one .
and this is continuing and continuing and continuing .
and four , a global recession that has fundamentally shocked consumer behaviors .
if we do not lift up the women who played critical roles in these struggles , we fail to offer up role models to future generations .
and that &apos;s a new kind of leadership for me .
between 1966 and 1990 , the u.s. and soviet interests fought for control over my country .
one percent check the box . the rest do nothing .
and finally , finally , they &apos;ve managed to put instant messaging on their computers at work .
but right now we don &apos;t have enough of that .
what now fits in our pockets would fit in a blood cell in 25 years .
young people living in kibera in their community , with simple handheld devices , gps handheld devices and sms-enabled mobile phones , have literally put themselves on the map .
mars is not our sister planet .
as i found , if you really want to know a people , you start by looking inside their bedrooms .
if you learn to code , you can code to learn .
&quot; a smile is a door that is half open and half closed , &quot; the author jennifer egan wrote .
but there &apos;s an important thing to remember here : even though companies pushed back , even though companies demanded , hey , let &apos;s do this through a warrant process , let &apos;s do this where we actually have some sort of legal review , some sort of basis for handing over these users &apos; data , we saw stories in the washington post last year that weren &apos;t as well reported as the prism story that said the nsa broke in to the data center communications between google to itself and yahoo to itself .
( laughter ) but actually , the most impressive thing to me is that — well , actually , i would also like to say this for all children is to say thank you to all adults , for actually caring for us a lot , and to make our future world much better .
so , where do we go from here ?
so one has got to discover a certain wholeness .
now , the final piece of this , the take-home message from a working memory capacity standpoint is this : what we process , we learn .
he missed .
we had a global bubble .
so you can think about how unstable that would be .
dean koontz built this fabulous home theater , which is — i don &apos;t think accidentally — in art deco style .
an extremely important part of this project was about how i photograph these extraordinary people .
the term &quot; &quot; manipulative , &quot; &quot; often charged against women in a derogatory way , reflects a reality in which women have often had to find ways other than direct confrontation to achieve their goals .
and who &apos;s to say that they &apos;re wrong ?
you sit there , ok .
and i think it &apos;s no accident that we think this way .
( laughter ) fg : you &apos;ve all heard the frank lloyd wright story , when the woman called and said , &quot; &quot; mr. wright , i &apos;m sitting on the couch and the water &apos;s pouring in on my head . &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; madam , move your chair . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so , some years later i was doing a building , a little house on the beach for norton simon , and his secretary , who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady , called me and said , &quot; &quot; mr. simon &apos;s sitting at his desk and the water &apos;s coming in on his head . &quot; &quot; and i told her the frank lloyd wright story .
and torture &apos;s a terrible enough thing as it is , but when it &apos;s done by your hero , that just breaks you in so many ways .
they fought for their rights for over two centuries , and maybe because they sacrifice other minorities , hispanic , asian , we would suffer more in the mainstream .
its origins are located in russia .
&quot; parting thought : when there &apos;s bigger and better errors , we &apos;ll have them . &quot;
and we &apos;ve already started construction on section two .
but dragonflies are not the only creatures that make the crossing .
well , from there , unfortunately , in 2004 , the project came to a halt . many political reasons .
now if you put these ideas together , the third idea is that we essentially give these robots mathematical descriptions of the shape they need to execute .
and this is a hundred-year-old toy .
you see the tragedy in south africa there .
jogging , which is commonplace , and widely accepted as good for you , is solemn .
and your eye doesn &apos;t know which level to read .
and let me just summarize . so the bottom line : the brain processes information using 100,000 times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have .
but they were not teaching .
we &apos;re collecting and creating all kinds of data about how we &apos;re living our lives , and it &apos;s enabling us to tell some amazing stories .
( laughter ) and people scream .
it helps to have good friends .
next , consider making your business carbon-neutral .
but if another language can think that thought , then , by cooperating , we can achieve and learn so much more .
and i got to tell you , i think that was a huge error .
and when someone wants to rent a room , they go onto the blockchain database and all the criteria , they sift through , it helps them find the right room , and then the blockchain helps with the contracting , it identifies the party , it handles the payments just through digital payments — they &apos;re built into the system .
and so people jumped on board , and not just in los angeles but across the country .
of course there are mysteries , but a mystery is a mystery .
and they are our responsibility .
i think in absolute terms , last year we earned about 20-odd million dollars , spent about 13 million , with over a 40 percent ebita .
and i &apos;m a very nerdy doctor , so i read all of the studies that i could on this drug . i read the one study that was published that showed that reboxetine was better than placebo , and i read the other three studies that were published that showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other antidepressant , and because this patient hadn &apos;t done well on those other antidepressants , i thought , well , reboxetine is just as good . it &apos;s one to try .
why is it a disease of the aged ?
let &apos;s look at a couple of quick examples .
but how is it that we can start to think about using choreographic thinking , kinesthetic intelligence , to arm the ways in which we think about things more generally ?
i can &apos;t go through all of them , but i &apos;ll give you an example .
mg : yeah , i &apos;ve had a lot of women say to me , &quot; &quot; i really don &apos;t think i could work with my husband .
the first thing , i got out of jail , of course after i took a shower , i went online , i opened my twitter account and my facebook page , and i &apos;ve been always very respectful to those people who are opining to me .
and if our sun has planets — mercury , venus , earth , mars , etc . , surely those other stars should have planets also , and they do .
i figure about half of that are men , so that takes the number down to 750,000 .
but we do provide on that website a standardized list of definitions , because it &apos;s hard to attack a behavior in the right way if we &apos;re not all sharing a definition of what that behavior is .
&quot; that &apos;s right , &quot; it said , &quot; i am youtube . &quot;
and the marrow miner , the way it works is shown here .
he &apos;s still waiting for his funeral in norway , and none of his family will be able to attend .
one of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet .
so get peacekeepers there , but get them home as soon as possible .
and the collective has enabled me to form collaborations with a whole array of interesting people .
so i made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life , and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse — the subject of martyrdom , the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection of love of god , faith , but violence and crime and cruelty .
impressive . thank you .
pew research polls chinese public attitudes , and here are the numbers in recent years .
and my intention was to go out to the gyre , raise awareness about this issue and begin to pick up the plastic , chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks that could potentially be used as building materials in underdeveloped communities .
and a small group of thoughtful people changed that bay .
we are going to need a new generation of citizen leaders willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning as rapidly as possible .
now we &apos;re talking scale .
my mother &apos;s mother left europe in a hurry without her husband , but with her three-year-old daughter and diamonds sewn into the hem of her skirt .
and in fact , there &apos;s a thriving market in the partially eaten food of beloved people .
this is a new device that is essentially doing that .
if we can install these molecules in neurons somehow , then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light .
that &apos;s my simple proposition to you , my simple plea to every decision-maker in this room , everybody out there .
we asked ourselves simply : can design help rebuild trust ?
and it just disturbed me so much .
you see these cars that drive up — usually it &apos;s saabs and audis and volvos , because in certain neighborhoods it &apos;s socially acceptable to have a luxury car , so long as it comes from a country hostile to u.s. foreign policy — that &apos;s fine .
so i started thinking about peace , and i was obviously , as i said to you , very much moved by these images , trying to make sense of that .
and i feel that we have a special connection , which i value very much .
i spent ages flying this flight simulator , and i honestly believed i could fly airplanes by the end of it .
because gps doesn &apos;t work under water . that &apos;s why we need these tools .
and the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on .
and what we can do with our biology is going to shape our future and that of our children and that of their children — whether we gain control over aging , whether we learn to protect ourselves from alzheimer &apos;s , and heart disease , and cancer .
it &apos;s basically a little health care screening tool that we developed .
ataturk was a lateral thinker .
through his eyes , we knew when he needed to hear again , &quot; &quot; it is all set , jim . we &apos;re going to take care of shirley right here at the ranch , and acr &apos;s going to take care of your wildlife forever . &quot; &quot; from this experience i &apos;m going to share five practices .
my mother and father had been saving money for years to be able to buy that machine , and the first day it was going to be used , even grandma was invited to see the machine .
in fact , it &apos;s continued to increase .
my name is ani , and i &apos;m a designer and researcher at mit media lab , where i &apos;m part of a relatively new and unique group called design fiction , where we &apos;re wedged somewhere between science fiction and science fact .
but growing up as a child with the books around everywhere , with people to talk to about those books , this wasn &apos;t a sort of slightly learned thing .
they were living on top of the workshops where they were working .
and to get there , we have to change our workplaces , our policies and our culture .
this is not sustainable .
now the other thing is , we don &apos;t really know that much about how to make a particular thing happen by changing particular spots in the genome .
example number two : wikipedia .
what is love ?
now , of course , just like life , soap operas do ultimately meet the big finale .
what we noticed is when the bacteria were alone , so when they were in dilute suspension , they made no light .
but they can often reveal themselves negatively , in the form of jealousy .
history is not linear .
show the kids what bad customers or bad employees look like .
and we wanted to try and encourage people to use energy better .
then it deserves protection .
around here , no ? the redwood forests are gone .
so here we are in one part of the world — a time of joy , excitement , dreaming of the future of that child — while in another world , parents are filled with dread , not daring to dream of a future for their child beyond a few precious weeks .
so there are many other details like this .
equally startling , from my point of view , is the fact that no one was drawing any connections between what is happening to the body politic , and what is happening in our leading educational institutions .
they choose very carefully who they connect with .
it also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm , or their farm to a town , or from a town to a city .
so , i thought , could we have darius serve as our babycam carrier , and that way get the inputs that we feed into dylan ?
i was in congo in february , dancing and celebrating with women who &apos;ve survived the destruction of their selves in literally unthinkable ways — destroyed because other brutalized , psychopathic selves all over that beautiful land are fueling our selves &apos; addiction to ipods , pads , and bling , which further disconnect ourselves from ever feeling their pain , their suffering , their death .
because food is one issue that cannot be solved person by person , nation by nation .
well , when we look out , you and i , over that canopy of the intact primary forest , what we see is this enormous carpet of carbon .
she pointed out that the &quot; &quot; control men &quot; &quot; — as she called them — who carpet-bombed towns and fields with toxic insecticides like ddt , were only trying to kill the little stuff , the insects , not the birds .
i think these are so commonplace , they &apos;ve become clichés of our society .
with gravitational waves , we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning .
you have to trust me . take it on faith . &quot; &quot; well , i &apos;m sorry , people , but we are back to the pre-enlightenment church , and we need to fight against that .
this is based on the number of hosts .
and you can &apos;t tell the story about pollinators — bees , bats , hummingbirds , butterflies — without telling the story about the invention of flowers and how they co-evolved over 50 million years .
now we don &apos;t know if it says hollywood , or even bollywood for that matter .
and i also want to share this one .
solidifying into surface , molded by fire .
the doctor , medical team from university of miami arrived at five in the morning .
do you want to view the pandemic threat the way back in the 1950s people viewed the civil defense issue , and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu ?
they are sold in the name of forced labor , camel jockeying , anything , everything .
now , what you can see here is essentially a sugar molecule that was added a small little tag that is signaling to us outside of the body , &quot; hey , i &apos;m here . &quot;
( applause ) in 1949 we saw the emergence of the modern china in a way which surprised the world .
but we call each reading an emotion data point , and then they can fire together to portray different emotions .
how about underground with a view ?
were we to be able to identify this condition at an earlier point , and intervene and treat — i can tell you , this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past 10 years , this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition .
one brooklyn paper called this bike lane that we have on prospect park west &quot; &quot; the most contested piece of land outside of the gaza strip . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and this is what we had done .
ten years ago , when i was on an airplane and i introduced myself to my seatmate , and told them what i did , they &apos;d move away from me , because , quite rightly , they were saying psychology is about finding what &apos;s wrong with you .
and you know , i saw all the visions of the first couple of sessions .
but so too can our mind .
it &apos;s really difficult .
now this is a little bit of a dangerous metaphor , because of course we all know that inside of the trojan horse were a bunch of people with spears .
so we find this penny kind of fossilized in the floor , and we think that a very wealthy man must have left it there because regular people don &apos;t just lose money .
it &apos;s really just a pressure sensor like the kind that &apos;s in a doorbell .
and i suddenly thought , most deaf children are born to hearing parents .
so in the volume of the ocean , we will know , not just the physics and the chemistry , but the base of the food chain will be transparent to us with data on a continuous basis .
and even if they sometimes do nothing at all .
what was common to us all 40 years ago — the telling of stories between generations — is now rarified .
it &apos;s a very , very simple example , an easily stated question in probability , which every — you &apos;re in good company — everybody gets wrong .
( laughter ) and that was the 1950s .
it &apos;s the outstanding collaborators who enjoy the long careers , because bringing out the best in others is how they found the best in themselves . &quot; &quot; and when i went to visit companies that are renowned for their ingenuity and creativity , i couldn &apos;t even see any superstars , because everybody there really mattered .
frequently , a strategy has to be rethought .
and finally , well , there are those who believe that corruption is unavoidable .
at that moment , they fired and shot off my fingers .
i feel ashamed .
as i witnessed my father &apos;s body being swallowed by fire , i sat by his funeral pyre and wrote .
see , that skylight goes down and becomes that one .
so , for example , stones .
because the thing about being autistic is , i had to learn social skills like being in a play .
wonder is honest , it &apos;s completely innocent .
let &apos;s focus on the conversations between our friends and our family and our coworkers and our loved ones .
he goes , &quot; &quot; hey , mister ! mister ! &quot; &quot; and i looked at him — he didn &apos;t know any other english than that , but we didn &apos;t need english , no , no , no , no , no .
one day you &apos;re living your ordinary life , you &apos;re planning to go to a party , you &apos;re taking your children to school , you &apos;re making a dentist appointment .
i work in some of the most extreme cave environments on the planet .
so if i understood the chemistry of trustworthiness , i might help alleviate poverty .
metaphor is not just the detection of patterns ; it is the creation of patterns .
if they &apos;re new books and you can just , you know , butcher them , because you could just buy another one , that &apos;s not such a big deal in terms of doing high-quality scanning .
we started looking for funding , but instead , we just ran into questions , like , how many houses are you going to paint ?
so to me , there are no sudanese problems or south african problems or kenyan problems , only african problems because eventually , we share the turmoil .
such understated power here , in these tottering dancers who exert stupendous effort on tasks most view as insignificant .
he painted the walls and he painted the machine , and he got the operators retrained by people who know kids , like children &apos;s museum people .
so i finished , and it was a success in a sense .
and the people who were highly trusted 20 years ago are still rather highly trusted : judges , nurses .
too often , we receive information from journalists but we forget how that information was given .
i mean , i can use profane words like &quot; &quot; shit &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; piss , &quot; &quot; and then my grandma won &apos;t watch the video .
and it &apos;s a sort of a working computer . and when i built this computer , i had a moment of — what is it called ? — the epiphany where i realized that the computer &apos;s just so fast .
this is a drug called tamiflu . tamiflu is a drug which governments around the world have spent billions and billions of dollars on stockpiling , and we &apos;ve stockpiled tamiflu in panic , in the belief that it will reduce the rate of complications of influenza .
and it hurts your throat .
we &apos;re being critical of the west , the perception of the west about our identity — about the image that is constructed about us , about our women , about our politics , about our religion .
that &apos;s shown in what i consider to be the most scary economic statistic of our time .
it evokes the container metaphor of communication , in which we conceive of ideas as objects , sentences as containers , and communication as a kind of sending .
one idea is that our three-dimensional universe may be embedded in a high-dimensional space , just as you can imagine on these sheets of paper .
it has a very large , thick atmosphere , and in fact , its surface environment was believed to be more like the environment we have here on the earth , or at least had in the past , than any other body in the solar system .
so that &apos;s as wide as we look at stories .
and then eventually , of course , they all did .
( laughter ) and this dot comes from that number .
so we want things that nest , we want things that stack , and we want it digitized .
the music was in some ways different , but in structure and form , very much the same .
we can &apos;t scale .
i actually don &apos;t buy this gloomy narrative , and i don &apos;t think you should either .
ynh : again , it &apos;s not a prophecy ; it &apos;s seeing all kinds of possibilities before us .
&quot; &quot; achilles was a man who could shape history , a man of destiny , and this is what you should be , alexander . &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what he heard .
now i never really asked my grandparents for anything .
i mean , how hard can it be ?
please enjoy .
and we had no clue where it was .
and bed nets have an effect on the epidemic , but you &apos;re never going to make it extinct with bed nets .
can we get complex 3d structure automatically assembling in inorganic systems ?
we didn &apos;t start out thinking that we were going to need mars watches .
humanity can finally learn from the information that it can collect , as part of our timeless quest to understand the world and our place in it , and that &apos;s why big data is a big deal .
( applause ) and this is what we discovered .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t also destroy it .
god no , it was therapy .
what have i heard during these last four days ?
( laughter ) i said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ll tell you what . i &apos;ll build you an arm that &apos;s under nine pounds that has all that capability in one year .
one of the dwarfs i got to know was a guy named clinton brown .
they were waiting to see what would happen , didn &apos;t trust insurance companies , or thought , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve managed for so many years .
gunpowder , cannon .
and it &apos;s speculated that some of their interest in the arts was designed to counter soviet communism and promote what it considered to be pro-american thoughts and aesthetics .
and these four groups are just the ants outside the nest .
i just spent all this time buying this product and now i have to charge before use .
indra saw the woman , a sekhri .
and i partnered with the school nutrition association , and did you know that a little over 30 million kids participate in school lunch programs every day .
bj : but when this little cub saw that i had vacated my seat and climbed to the back to get some camera gear , she came in like a curious cat to come and investigate .
here , craig is working the head .
and i think , as a conceptual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling , that makes it not much use .
or as my friend descartes might put it , we think , therefore we are .
they &apos;re places where we keep objects of great value to us , where we simply treasure them for them being themselves .
more fascinating , you have other countries — south africa , mauritius , namibia — all in single digits .
tk : all right . so that &apos;s exciting on where we may go with the better mechatronics , if we make them good enough to put out on the market and use in a field trial .
so , with all that information , the big question is — what do we actually — what does she tell us ?
it &apos;s about saving lives . how cool is that ?
those , then , are the ways in which older people are useful in traditional societies .
i hope you &apos;ll help us make this wish come true .
i know that as a scientist , i have information and as a human being , i can communicate with anybody , inside or outside of academia .
it started earth day .
that is your itinerary , you will probably travel 53,000 kilometers , visit around , i think , 46 institutions , and just fyi , you might release 10 tons of co2 emissions .
and depending on who you ask , the surge was supposed to push it up even further .
but i had a problem . once i had all these machines , i was spending too much time teaching students to use them .
and let me try to help you understand their perspective .
i didn &apos;t know what the rules were , i &apos;m a natural born scientist , i guess , or some kind of a throwback to the 17th century , whatever .
and this is actually what it looks like , hundreds of blood vessels , all growing toward the center of the wound .
i love pun and the relation to the unconscious .
what you find is that people are good at telling the difference between real and posed laughter .
and it was like holding onto a thousand horses .
it &apos;s very interesting . when we started our school the parents would give thumbprints in the attendance register .
the political vision of a terrorist organization is decided by the leadership , which , generally , is never more than five to seven people .
none of it in our textbooks . none of this in our textbooks .
is it metabolized in the liver ?
and how do we grow things like food that grew up on earth like us ?
read the license .
giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem .
the only abrupt worldwide change would have been major asteroid impacts or volcanic super-eruptions .
we went to africa , sudan , sierra leone , liberia , kenya .
&quot; why does she want to meet us ? &quot;
as i began to think about stories like this and hear about stories like this , i began to ask myself and imagine : is there an alternative ?
now , these suppliers were our big companies .
what you &apos;re looking at is a phone looking at one after another picture of a bird , and actually not only saying , &quot; &quot; yes , it &apos;s a bird , &quot; &quot; but identifying the species of bird with a network of this sort .
and i think this starts with probably your physical body and fitness more than anything , because we can control that .
so why is high blood pressure so differentially deadly for black men ?
first of all , you know , for a long time computer games meant things like &quot; &quot; doom , &quot; &quot; where you &apos;re going around shooting things , very violent games , very fast , aimed at teenage boys . right ? that &apos;s who plays computer games .
he didn &apos;t read a note , and he was profoundly hearing impaired .
but let &apos;s think for a moment about jarrett &apos;s initial instinct .
so now — ( applause ) thank you .
same thing with laysan albatross who travel an entire ocean on a trip sometimes , up to the same zone the tunas use .
the benefits of doing so are enormous , the risks minimal .
it &apos;s made of asphalt , and asphalt is a very nice material to drive on , but not always , especially not on these days as today , when it &apos;s raining a lot .
so like in tennis , usually it &apos;s win-lose ; it always adds up to zero-zero-sum . but if you &apos;re playing doubles , the person on your side of the net , they &apos;re in the same boat as you , so you &apos;re playing a non-zero-sum game with them .
in the classroom , we have arguments on some of the most fiercely held moral convictions that students have about big public questions .
and so , what you &apos;ve seen today is less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here , and in the ted lab , we have a tour that was created by a six-year-old named benjamin that will knock your socks off . ( laughter ) so we &apos;ll see you there . thank you .
on the other hand , we now can understand how old the universe is .
it must be like that for kyu doing things with musicians — it &apos;s similar to that i would imagine — where you ... huh ?
and given the state of the world today , there &apos;s really no other option .
this particular reel — it &apos;s an industrial video — but it was shown in drive-in theaters in 1961 — in the detroit area , in fact — and it preceded alfred hitchcock &apos;s &quot; &quot; psycho . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so i like to think there was something going on there of the new generation of makers coming out of this , plus &quot; &quot; psycho . &quot; &quot; this is andrew archer .
it &apos;s perceived to be part of an elite agenda rather than something that benefits all .
to see what &apos;s going to happen , you can &apos;t just look at the workforce that is now , you have to look at our future workforce .
do you recall when i showed you these puzzle pieces ?
and i &apos;m not sure what the best way to organize the whole thing is .
you hurry , you get where you &apos;re going , but you get there alone .
the second , more honest way is to actually fix the model .
the negatives are gone .
( applause ) bruno giussani : mark , mark , come back . ( applause )
i think it gives an understanding of how we &apos;re picking out movement from what dan &apos;s doing , but i think it will also show you , if you look at that movement , that when dan makes music , his motions are very purposeful , very precise , very disciplined and they &apos;re also very beautiful .
and this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein is going to fold .
and sometimes that can be different amounts over different times or with different people or on different days .
it says , &quot; &quot; just knowing i can call you at four in the morning if i need to makes me not really need to , &quot; &quot; which i love , because together these are like , &quot; &quot; hallmark : when you care enough to send the very best twice , phrased slightly differently . &quot; &quot; i was not surprised at the tedster and new yorker magazine overlap .
why can &apos;t we ? why can &apos;t humans regenerate ?
take the fatihah , the seven-verse opening chapter that is the lord &apos;s prayer and the shema yisrael of islam combined .
central among them , a commitment to exclusively peaceful means .
we did it so fast we weren &apos;t prepared for their collapse .
take this tiger , for example .
and it &apos;s worth probably about three macbook pros .
or perhaps i should say , more accurately , señor pringle .
the seer of clouds had to take account of it .
i expect to live 100 years .
and it turns out that both human and other brains cost about the same , an average of six calories per billion neurons per day .
but wagner made an innovation .
violence can be stopped .
two days after , i was transferred to another place .
fred sexton was a friend of this guy , george hodel .
well , you have to find someone who is willing to be a surrogate .
so you photograph that in exactly the same position , and then you can substitute in — and that part does use photoshop — just the edges .
just then , with a loud bang , the heavens opened . ( claps ) and the god indra jumped into the clearing .
you can also see the evolution of the one-child-only policy as it travels through the bloodline .
we closed broadway from 42nd street to 47th street and created two and a half acres of new pedestrian space .
tori rebuilt the american pearl , and in december of 1999 , she did it .
let &apos;s say that if the physics of fusion is encoded into the universe , maybe the physics of life is as well .
and because nothing is more important to us than survival , the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe called the amygdala .
he even once traded a work of art for a block of government cheese because the person wanted it so badly .
again , it &apos;s kind of coming out of nowhere ; it &apos;s a little hard to use right now .
( applause ) okay . the point is it &apos;s really hard to tell , isn &apos;t it ? it &apos;s incredible , we looked at students do this and they couldn &apos;t tell .
governments don &apos;t naturally pick these things in the right way .
there are charts which show all these movements of information . that density of information is amazing .
this led me to starting a company called design within reach , a company dealing with simple forms , making good designers available to us , and also selling the personalities and character of the designers as well , and it seems to have worked .
you know .
coral reefs are chemists .
she talks with the women and explains that the land is barren because they have cut and sold the trees .
we stayed in old , crumbling , walled cities , in tiny little hotels , and we would climb up to the roof and drink vinho verde and watch the sun set and play checkers .
so i was thinking how i could explain myself better about how big and enormous this code is .
it &apos;s about an m.p. called geoffrey dickens .
and they made their own comics , starring the cartoon lunch lady alongside their actual lunch ladies .
now let &apos;s add a mycorrhiza plant into the diagram i used earlier .
we all know that as we form thoughts , they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains .
so it seems right .
and my job is to look at lots of different species of animals and try to figure out how their tissues and organs work when everything &apos;s going right , rather than trying to figure out how to fix things when they go wrong , like so many of you .
and this gets us back to the mushrooms .
and you then feel you must act .
and what it is — it &apos;s a twist on health .
and not just us . it &apos;s also kids .
will it be under $ 20 ?
our collective vision at naya jeevan , which for many of you , as you all recognize , means &quot; &quot; new life &quot; &quot; in urdu and hindi , is to rejuvenate the lives of millions of low income families by providing them with affordable access to catastrophic health care .
right ? so these guys are kind of the hungry and foolish and colorful guys , right ?
because the zetas organization was founded in treason , they lost some of the linkages to the production and distribution in the most profitable markets like cocaine , but what they did have , and this is again based on their military origin , was a perfectly structured chain of command with a very clear hierarchy and a very clear promotion path that allowed them to supervise and operate across many , many markets very effectively , which is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do .
and they did this by painstaking observations of numerous distant galaxies , allowing them to chart how the expansion rate has changed over time .
i have given the slide show that i gave here two years ago about 2,000 times .
jodi lomask , and her wonderful troupe capacitor , joined me in the canopy in my rainforest site in costa rica .
we &apos;ve literally consumed an entire river in north america for irrigation .
and yet when i think of the poverty of society which doesn &apos;t give freedom to its people , i don &apos;t admire those buildings .
my personality was entombed within a seemingly silent body , a vibrant mind hidden in plain sight within a chrysalis .
voice 1 : you &apos;ll have to stay here in the safe house until we get word the terrorist threat is over .
now that i know it &apos;s a photograph , i &apos;ve got dozens of other binary translation techniques to visualize and understand that information , so in a matter of seconds , we can take this information , shove it through a dozen other visual translation techniques in order to find out exactly what we were looking at .
it &apos;s the first working prototype of the clock .
and whenever we discuss one of these problems that we have to address — child labor in cottonseed farms in india — this year we will monitor 50,000 cottonseed farms in india .
and technology was going to carry us along .
and it was in this , preliminary to these pieces of furniture , that ricky and i worked on furniture by the slice .
the other way is to change the type of food .
it &apos;s bigger than the difference between the microbes in this reef and the microbes in this prairie .
and he took lithium , and he went down the line .
auke ijspeert : absolutely . so the robot — we have some spin-off projects where we would like to use the robots to do search and rescue inspection , so this robot is now seeing you .
we regarded each other , scrutinized one another .
i &apos;m going to start by asking you a question : is anyone familiar with the blue algae problem ?
the first thing you will notice on signing up to one of these sites is how familiar it looks .
i study ants in the desert , in the tropical forest and in my kitchen , and in the hills around silicon valley where i live .
have you ever hoped that there was some ability you hadn &apos;t discovered yet that you were just naturally great at ?
have you ever eaten a booger long past your childhood ?
this is not a wardrobe malfunction . i have to take my belt off here .
that &apos;s actually not true .
by coincidence , as lorna and judith worked behind the scenes to reform the criteria , people all over the world were seeing an autistic adult for the first time .
this may seem minor , but it is terrifying to hear rumor after rumor after rumor that another tidal wave , bigger than the last , will be coming at exactly 1 p.m. , or perhaps tonight , or perhaps ...
and i could spend hours talking about them , because they &apos;re all kind of heroes .
in that same year , i &apos;ve found out , only 20 % of people had used these surgery-bank checks .
we had the journalist &#91; heather &#93; brooke speaking about her battle against government corruption , and she introduced me to this website , alaveteli.com.
i mean it &apos;s , &quot; &quot; i have my friends , therefore i am . &quot; &quot; lt : ( laughter ) jf : no , it &apos;s true .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve noticed , but there &apos;s been a spate of books that have come out lately contemplating or speculating on the cognition and emotional life of dogs .
on the other hand , if you &apos;re visiting an underdeveloped country , and 25 dollars buys you a gourmet meal , it &apos;s exorbitant for a big mac .
2005 , anthony fitzherbert , an agricultural engineer , could travel through helmand , could stay in nad ali , sangin and ghoresh , which are now the names of villages where fighting is taking place .
and i was on fire — excruciating , excruciating pain .
tom &apos;s hand . tom &apos;s hand . tom &apos;s hand . ( laughter ) anyway .
what if we zoomed out and actually tried to experience our own cultural big bang ?
some people have called a cyberwar what may actually be just a spy operation — and obviously , a quite mishandled one .
we proposed a building that was audacious , that was different than any of the forms that the community was used to , and we were scared and our client was scared and the community was scared , so we created a series of photorealistic renderings that we put onto facebook and we put onto instagram , and we let people start to do what they do : share it , comment , like it , hate it .
we live in one world .
on the right-hand side , &#91; 0,0 &#93; input is a 1 output , which goes up .
recently , i showed this to my students , and i just asked them to try and explain why it happened .
another example , this was completely packed with houses , and then we built this , what we call , a knowledge square .
so , there &apos;s another picture . here , this one . i really do like this picture .
he showed him , &quot; &quot; you know , we don &apos;t have to do this wrong .
the last time you were in the presence of a baby — this happens to be my granddaughter , mitra .
and if you pick up one of those magazines , it &apos;s hard to resist , isn &apos;t it ?
with tania singer at the max planck institute of leipzig , we showed that the brain networks for empathy and loving-kindness are different .
i was thinking , i &apos;m mutilated ? i &apos;m a mutilated person .
you can be a general , a politician , an economist who is depressed , a musician in a minor key , a painter in dark colors .
and then we introduce them to somebody who they come to hate immediately , the drill sergeant .
yes , we built our first satellite prototype in our garage .
the reason why we forgot that is because the times in history when architecture did the most to transform society were those times when , actually , the one percent would build on behalf of the 99 percent , for various different reasons , whether that was through philanthropy in the 19th century , communism in the early 20th , the welfare state , and most recently , of course , through this inflated real estate bubble .
but the one thing they didn &apos;t capture was making love .
and so what i want to do with you in , oh god , only 10 minutes , is to really think again this juxtaposition , because it actually has massive , massive implications beyond innovation policy , which just happens to be the area that i often talk with with policymakers .
you put it in your search engine , and you create the drug to treat the threat .
i &apos;m going to share with you some of the exciting work that &apos;s going on .
powered by the massive data from imagenet and the modern cpus and gpus to train such a humongous model , the convolutional neural network blossomed in a way that no one expected .
this is a korean church that we did in queens .
and for me , the man of steel , christopher reeve , has best raised the awareness on the distress of spinal cord injured people .
these animals , they were being demonized .
now comedy travels along a distinct wavelength from other forms of language .
and he says , &quot; &quot; i want my cheese sandwich . &quot; &quot; and he takes this one .
but this conclusion would ignore a tectonic shift taking place in egypt far from the cameras in tahrir square .
but my spirit is strong as ever .
and so , those two individuals have different numbers of friends .
and just now in england they had a cold spell .
we are now the major agent of impact on our earth .
i was all set to be a diplomat , teacher , doctor — all laid out .
allow me to try to answer this question in the few coming minutes .
you can see a timeline , showing you the exciting moments throughout the story .
that narrative of gratitude runs through a lot of the stories i hear .
he said in his lifetime he had climbed a great mountain , the mountain of challenging and then defeating racial oppression and defeating apartheid .
so this behavior of risk avoidance is a very old evolutionary response .
well in surgery , you couldn &apos;t have people who are more specialized and you couldn &apos;t have people who are better trained .
if you just run the simulation , it will just collapse , like this .
and this is the ability to program physical and biological materials to change shape , change properties and even compute outside of silicon-based matter .
i remember one particularly low moment .
and the maps of violence in most u.s. cities looked like this .
they are not meant to stay .
( laughter ) ( applause ) so we are natural-born dualists .
so what does play do for the brain ?
this has to be described as an adventure , not a burden .
alzheimer &apos;s disease : there &apos;s five million people affected , and you can check vital signs , activity , balance .
and you start to see things .
well , he told me .
( laughter ) allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame .
what will we know ? what will we learn ?
so why are screens so pervasive in our analog life ?
you should always use a condom , &quot; &quot; and yet , in her relationship , she &apos;s not empowered — what &apos;s going to happen ?
one can become an object of public ridicule because of a misplaced b.
it &apos;s not one of these statistics which is very doubtful .
you sell your products more expensively .
and the large companies , they typically have wonderful wellness programs , but the medium-sized companies that typically fall between the cracks on issues like this , they started to get engaged and used our program as a model for their own employees to try and have contests to see who might be able to deal with their obesity situation in a way that could be proactively beneficial to others .
we &apos;re going to learn how to make one flap .
i thought , &quot; &quot; oh gracious , if these two players , either one of them &quot; &quot; — they were different years , but i thought about each one at the time he was there — &quot; &quot; oh , if he ever makes the varsity , our varsity must be pretty miserable , if he &apos;s good enough to make it . &quot; &quot; and you know , one of them was a starting player for a season and a half .
so the train is now pulling into the third stop along the 6 line .
and another story of the cylinder begins .
you &apos;re seeing a plot .
as a scientist , i always wanted to measure that resonance , that sense of the other that happens so quickly , in the blink of an eye .
thinking , how can that be ? you &apos;re cheating . the lines are curved .
secondly , in the communist ideology , there &apos;s no place for criticism .
again , chiming with your view that china has a militarized regime ready to , you know , mobilize its enormous forces .
this is a spectacular coral garden .
all right . i understand . if you &apos;re unwilling to — all right , well , we can discuss that after class .
i was not a great student .
but because so many of the issues in education aren &apos;t just in school , they &apos;re in family and community , what you also need , definitely , is more on the right hand side .
imagine that that earth is at the center of the universe , and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere .
you are somebody who wants to make a difference .
but you also have to provide usable evidence that you are trustworthy .
five or less digits . so , if you &apos;re in the tens of thousands you &apos;ve got to sit down .
we worked like dogs down in the garment industry every single day .
i want us all to change the verb .
now , there &apos;s no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of brad superimposed over another actor &apos;s body .
( laughter ) but what about this day , this one particular friday ?
less than one day of exxon &apos;s revenues .
once we &apos;ve discovered somebody has low vision , the next big challenge is to work out why , and to be able to do that , we need to have access to the inside of the eye .
there are different programs for graduate students , for executives at different companies .
and i wonder what he &apos;s soaking in .
i particularly like the little linux penguin in the back . ( laughter ) so one of the things that that &apos;s leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion .
the first paradox is that growing up is about rejecting the past and then promptly reclaiming it .
to just bring them to justice . &quot; &quot; but of course , they don &apos;t listen .
i should be able to ask my house where my shoes are .
so like the periodic table , we came up with our own table of the elements : new lifeforms that were computationally grown , additively manufactured and biologically augmented .
here &apos;s the mr. it provides the framework .
the closer one gets , the more new features one discovers .
but there &apos;s also another problem from ships that i &apos;m illustrating here , and that &apos;s the problem of collision .
and to me this was a key component that somehow , through this medium of photography , which allows us to contemplate these landscapes , that i thought photography was perfectly suited to doing this type of work .
and there &apos;s a difference there too , because if we , you in the audience , or i , if we decide to have a designer baby , then their children will also be genetically modified , and so on , because it &apos;s heritable .
my head snapped back over my red seat .
that was designed on that machine , in the woods behind the institute .
what i want to do more generally is to get you thinking about the place of uncertainty and randomness and chance in our world , and how we react to that , and how well we do or don &apos;t think about it .
he was strong , steady , disciplined .
i found this one watering hole , and felt if everything remained the same way it was behaving , i had a real opportunity to capture something unique .
( laughter ) so i &apos;m sorry about that .
we &apos;re talking about energy .
it &apos;s fundamental to darwin and mendel and so on .
thank you very much indeed . ( applause )
our city is very spread out .
i &apos;m going to argue that , in fact , business strategy has always been premised on assumptions about technology , that those assumptions are changing , and , in fact , changing quite dramatically , and that therefore what that will drive us to is a different concept of what we mean by business strategy .
i &apos;m a corporate lawyer most of the time for an organization called enablis that supports entrepreneurs in south africa .
and that &apos;s a little image of the tree of stansted .
that all seems like win to me .
and i fell into those thousands of connections that i &apos;d made , and i asked my crowd to catch me .
there was no place to stay , so i stuck my computer in , i went away , came back after a couple of months , found kids playing games on it .
so , describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt . go ahead .
and it &apos;s a rare fungus .
principle number two : we have to recognize and celebrate diversity in this stuff .
however , huge supercomputer analyses , done of the likely effectiveness of this , show that it won &apos;t buy us much time at all .
what you &apos;ve done makes people laugh and then think .
and they know how to bring it back because they have demystified one big myth , which is the myth of spontaneity , which is that it &apos;s just going to fall from heaven while you &apos;re folding the laundry like a deus ex machina , and in fact they understood that whatever is going to just happen in a long-term relationship , already has .
so the idea is that we get the speed and efficiency benefits of using these physical dials together with the flexibility and versatility of a system that &apos;s designed in software .
so , there &apos;s plenty of non-zero-sumness .
should one of them stop working or reduce hours to be home ?
in other words , they mastered the art of doing more with less , which is the essence of frugal innovation .
left home .
so i think that actually step two , that i called a step a moment ago , isn &apos;t a step at all .
what am i doing this for ?
and a variety of other studies have shown that the microbial community that lives in and on us helps in development of the immune system , helps in fighting off pathogens , helps in our metabolism , and determining our metabolic rate , probably determines our odor , and may even shape our behavior in a variety of ways .
but unfortunately , he died prematurely in 1970 , and so he wasn &apos;t really able to live that dream completely .
it makes use of the gps — you &apos;re familiar with gps in your automobile , but you may not be familiar with the fact that there &apos;s a gps u.s. , there &apos;s a russian gps , and there &apos;s a new gps system going to europe , called galileo .
you know , that &apos;s not good enough .
it &apos;s even on thongs , but compressed to &quot; &quot; how about never — is never good for you ? &quot; &quot; now these look like very different forms of humor but actually they bear a great similarity .
they said , one , the bridge doesn &apos;t exist .
if you go on , that &apos;s a slightly more complicated program that &apos;s now doing all sorts of algorithmic things and creating user interface and so on .
so i sent a cold email to info @ equaljusticeintiative.org : &quot; &quot; dear bryan , &quot; &quot; it said , &quot; &quot; i think your building project is maybe the most important project we could do in america and could change the way we think about racial injustice .
ln : and at some point , she noticed something .
because to imitate a complex act requires my brain to adopt the other person &apos;s point of view .
thirteen species — highest diversity we can find in one single area in africa .
and one night , there &apos;s a knock at his hotel room door .
it was 11 : 50pm .
mm : it starts playing immediately .
they &apos;re ways in which we can have greater choice for refugees beyond those basic , impossible three options i explained to you and still leave others better off .
we find that if we get them out of institutions and into loving families early on , they recover their developmental delays , and go on to lead normal , happy lives .
is it something as obvious as that jealousy , which boils down into person , desire , impediment , is such a solid narrative foundation ?
the experts call this the girl effect .
and before we have the debate , i &apos;d like to actually take a show of hands — on balance , right now , are you for or against this ?
for every dollar given to a women &apos;s program , 20 dollars are given to men &apos;s programs .
and what have you always wanted to ask someone from the other side ?
when the terrorist incidents occurred in the united kingdom a couple of years ago , i think even though they didn &apos;t claim as many lives as we lost in the united states on 9 / 11 , i think the thing that troubled the british most was that the perpetrators were not invaders , but homegrown citizens whose religious and political identities were more important to them than the people they grew up with , went to school with , worked with , shared weekends with , shared meals with .
( laughter ) if you put it next to contemporary architecture , it feels totally natural to me .
so i just want to welcome all of you onto the ride .
and it was through crowd-sourcing , it was through the kindness that strangers were showing me , that i could uncover parts of my past that were haunting me .
i &apos;ve been at this for 30 years , and in that time i &apos;ve seen the ability , the commitment , the will of government to do this decline , and i don &apos;t see them making a comeback right now .
i lived with incredible birds , incredible animals , i swam in our small rivers with our caimans .
and we keep setting our expectations higher and higher .
so don &apos;t hang on till the bitter end .
deah and his wife yusor were a young married couple living in chapel hill , north carolina , where they both went to school .
but every generation has the chance to make it better .
and i &apos;m not going to take them somewhere and say , one day all of this will be yours .
they start at the surface of the brain , and then they dive down into the tissue itself , and as they spread out , they supply nutrients and oxygen to each and every cell in the brain .
what we want is to make sure that those individuals with autism can be free from the devastating consequences that come with it at times , the profound intellectual disabilities , the lack of language , the profound , profound isolation .
they &apos;ve bounded the city with a line .
the president of ethiopia said he would do it .
naghma lived in a refugee camp with her parents and her eight brothers and sisters .
ca : so that seems like a win for the consumer .
so my moment of truth did not come all at once .
this is a very nice pattern , and it &apos;s true , because 5 + 5 = 2 • 5 , etc .
but it also tells us something about policy .
so you &apos;ve got a lot of information . that &apos;s great .
now it &apos;s all done on my iphone , and it all goes straight up to my server , and my server does all the backend work and categorizes things and puts everything together .
they are the slaves .
and yet what we proved then is the u.s. has more market power than opec .
how do we get that to a million ?
and he wished me luck and he gave me some free books and he showed me out the door .
by that i mean , not just the choice to use a gene drive , but also the choice not to use one .
let me step back and take a look at why the city is so good for the blind .
that component is that we cannot be attached to outcome .
ca : wait , wait , wait , not doing anything ?
we can also magnify small mechanical movements , like vibrations in engines , that can help engineers detect and diagnose machinery problems , or see how our buildings and structures sway in the wind and react to forces .
i went to congo with msf , and contributed to a book and an exhibition that focused attention on a forgotten war in which millions of people have died , and exposure to disease without treatment is used as a weapon .
and none of this takes more money and none of this demands a bureaucracy , but it does demand that you think things differently and you are prepared to bend budgets and work programs in order to create that supportive framework that communities can bounce off .
except it &apos;s supposed to be brown .
here , instead of through the lens of a genome , through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record .
( laughter ) so , i couldn &apos;t let myself feel condescending towards these boys .
now , david builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab , but before he does that , he works with dancers to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place .
now , the best way of ending human suffering caused by war is to never go to war .
so let &apos;s start off by defining some terms .
you leave aside what is natural to be natural .
so when we went through the numbers , and just added that up — how much nuclear do we see china and india bringing online over the next 15 years , how much do we see at risk of being taken offline — this was the most startling finding .
few high schoolers had access to computers in those days .
and that is , of course , europe .
but of course , lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy .
in different contexts , cells do different things .
the life of a small-shareholder farmer is miserable .
and as you &apos;ll notice , it &apos;s still pretty gosh darn fast slowed down 333 times . it &apos;s an incredibly powerful movement .
in situations where you can &apos;t go about thinking how you &apos;d reverse this feeling of injustice , you can still think , maybe not what you can do , but what you can not do .
i blush whenever i show this .
so if this theory were true then it meant that light as it passed the sun should actually be bent around it .
some of that &apos;s good : oxfam , a great non-governmental actor .
and i have a volunteer subject in the audience today , julie .
and in fact , if you compare it to data , it fits very well with the development of cities and economies .
and this is an excerpt from my first editor &apos;s letter , where i say that rookie , we don &apos;t have all the answers , we &apos;re still figuring it out too , but the point is not to give girls the answers , and not even give them permission to find the answers themselves , but hopefully inspire them to understand that they can give themselves that permission , they can ask their own questions , find their own answers , all of that , and rookie , i think we &apos;ve been trying to make it a nice place for all of that to be figured out .
and experience is not just a kind of entertainment in a non-casual way .
and who &apos;s responsible ? designers .
and yamaha makes an incredible thing called the disklavier pro that looks like a nice grand piano there .
it can be deadly .
so whatever you get that can make you happy can go away .
it &apos;s a very frightening , very , very frightening thought .
it is the same in the 21st century . that &apos;s why i am going to decide to give this machine only for poor women across india .
i remember a journal article about this new question answering software that had a graph .
instead , she said , &quot; &quot; no , no . work and leisure can be together . &quot; &quot; yeah , that &apos;s particularly gorgeous — it &apos;s the tv dinner of 2001 .
it &apos;s out in the middle of the pacific , right around the equator .
so there was only one possibility — to bring the column out of the computer .
i hope when you learn things , like about how the natural world works — i just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper or you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child .
so cyber weapons are dangerous by nature , but in addition , they &apos;re emerging in a much more unstable environment .
and sneakerheads are the ones who drive the marketing and the hype and the pr and the brand cachet , and enable nike to sell millions of $ 60 sneakers .
well it so happens that we have a singular body .
the inventors don &apos;t know what the invention is .
this is the most disruptive technology — i &apos;ve been told by executives of the pesticide industry — that they have ever witnessed .
with the help of the family , they cross oceans , they cross deserts , they cross rivers , they cross mountains .
of my four-and-a-half-year commandship in that district , three years in , after putting pastors in the car with my police because i knew this — it &apos;s a little secret — i knew this : it was hard to stay a nasty police officer while you &apos;re riding around with a clergy .
now the first interface is called a drivegrip .
people &apos;s moral values , they &apos;re their most deeply held beliefs .
thank you .
so what happens if you start to explain space to them ?
here is a list of last year &apos;s graduates , graduated in june , and what they &apos;re currently doing — 48 of them .
now , sylvia browne is the big operator .
the conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold was able to learn .
i stay . if i go , i will be killed .
and by rating it and by rating the different people who submit information , we can get refined results and weighted results .
the cab stopped , and i pulled my body from it feeling each ounce of weight as i walked to the elevator .
and we think that this alignment is necessary for communication .
i was at the top of the general assembly just looking down into it and seeing it happen .
she looks at me like i &apos;m her , you know , her moron child , the cretin , the one she &apos;s got to speak to very slowly and distinctly .
and so that &apos;s what makes me lie awake at night , i guess , you know .
there are people now online that are friends ; they &apos;ve never met .
now i have carefully cropped this sequence to be exactly the duration of a human eye blink , so in the time that it would take you to blink your eye , the fly has seen this looming predator , estimated its position , initiated a motor pattern to fly it away , beating its wings at 220 times a second as it does so .
lots of people are used to having a spiritual tribe , or a church tribe , having a work tribe , having a community tribe .
if i zoom on it , you can see : that &apos;s the rover on the surface .
that &apos;s why i like what i do .
so that &apos;s one thing , to introduce the idea of doubt into graphics .
( dolphin noises ) you see , they &apos;re synchronizing with their partner as well as the other dyad .
beautiful , because it has symmetry .
this is a photograph taken about 100 years ago of my grandfather and great-grandfather .
i &apos;ll never forget that day back in the spring of 2006 .
i don &apos;t mean to be rude , but you know what a psychopath is .
he had installed the heavy equipment for his new process in an abandoned store in the vicinity of kings mountain , and for two months these 16 men would live and work together , mastering the new process .
in the words of the poet longfellow , &quot; the human voice is the organ of the soul . &quot;
( laughter ) every country is different and it &apos;s confusing , okay ?
and in the intervening years i had two daughters .
and now , brrrrrrrrrr , just like when you were a kid .
it was complex , but there was something capricious about its complexity .
but that doesn &apos;t mean we shouldn &apos;t do everything in our power to protect the environments that we rely and depend on , and like everest , the remote location and inadequate infrastructure of the orbital environment make waste disposal a challenging problem .
and that &apos;s also a higher hurdle . people drop out .
to the top right of the graph , are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well-being , but they &apos;re using a lot of planet to get there .
so the next time a victim of a privacy violation comes up to you , instead of blaming them , let &apos;s do this instead : let &apos;s shift our ideas about digital privacy , and let &apos;s respond with compassion .
but it &apos;s still true that a neuron , a nerve cell , looks the same in a crayfish , a bird or you .
he would promote the policeman immediately , so that p.c. bloggs became detective inspector bloggs in the course of the conversation and wave us on merrily .
let &apos;s see by a show of hands .
why don &apos;t we see more innovation in sanitation ?
but we can let that insecurity make us brittle or supple .
it &apos;s a simple choice , so we &apos;ve worked for many years with the forest stewardship council , with literally hundreds of other organizations , and there &apos;s a point here about collaboration .
first one : forbid installation on ground zero .
acinetobacter is a nasty hospital bug , and carbapenem is pretty much the strongest class of antibiotics that we can throw at this bug .
since i &apos;m home-schooled , i went to go hear him speak one day .
( to audience ) thank you , guys .
after treatment , the child gains significant functionality .
they had six million between them — and we beat them .
we used quantitative arteriography , showing the narrowing .
my measurements .
now , the rate is still too high — still too many people unnecessarily losing their lives .
shyness is about fear of social judgment .
so you ’ ve got that covered .
when i was a student at mit , we all shared one computer that took up a whole building .
and when they find them they pull them out and they pin them to the wall like butterflies .
for fashionistas , they want to stay ahead of the curve .
( video ) so you &apos;re me , and you &apos;re in math class yet again , because they make you go every single day .
it turns out that everyone &apos;s anecdotal experience out camping is actually true .
the devices are also biodegradable .
and as i &apos;ve shown here , we have the audience .
i didn &apos;t have to think about the notes .
we need now to adopt a new conception of agriculture .
so i said , have what , shall i translate the internet into some indian language ? that &apos;s not possible .
and here &apos;s an example .
the issue of privacy and personal data is much bigger than just the government , and so learn the facts .
when this happened to me 17 years ago , there was no name for it .
and when i have the question , it is a focus .
take a look at gabby .
the landscape has sadly become much more populated with instances like mine , whether or not someone actually make a mistake , and now it &apos;s for both public and private people .
so , the tiger is the icon .
and we have to resist to the changes .
and one of the first things that we discovered that i think is really helpful for understanding polarization is to understand that the political divide in our country is undergirded by a deeper moral divide .
and when the sun shines , you get copious quantities of these things , called neutrinos , pouring out .
crossing miles and miles of sastrugi — frozen ice snowdrifts that could be hip-deep .
but what you do know is that that introduction was nothing short of transformative .
one of my viewer &apos;s uncles died on a particular day and he chose to commemorate it with a piece of hate .
i &apos;ve met a lot of them .
if she is married to a man she doesn &apos;t like or if she is married to an old man , she has to accept , because she does not want to be dubbed as disobedient .
together you have changed the zeitgeist from analog to digital , and pushed the boundaries .
so i am convinced that if we can unlock the technologies that are commonplace in the richer world to be able to transform foods .
when the wildfires broke out in san diego , in october of 2007 , people turned to twitter to report what was happening and to find information from neighbors about what was happening around them .
it ain &apos;t okay . you know what ? it is not okay .
there &apos;s a whole gray market for lego , thousands of home-based businesses .
( laughter ) ( applause ) ( music ) sb : we ended up at what was advertised as the world &apos;s largest speed dating event .
so there is this key benefit that is relevant to state policy makers in terms of economic development .
the thing that caused massive policy changes to occur was race to the top for education .
and we learn and adapt the program accordingly .
and that was the job of the journalist . it was filtering all this stuff .
they are all remodeled . they all become specialized for the task at hand .
quite nice in itself , they &apos;re little , sort of , airplane things .
they were mostly reacting to my accent , that it is not normal for a narrator to have an accent .
in the u.k. we have an epidemic of facial injuries among young people .
thank you .
when you have a non-stick pan , it costs about , maybe , 250 rupees , five dollars , six dollars .
eighty-five to 95 percent of species at this time die out , and simultaneous to that is a huge , dramatic spike in carbon dioxide , that a lot of scientists agree comes from a simultaneous eruption of volcanoes and a runaway greenhouse effect .
it means that you can &apos;t get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so much .
is it a part of a circle ?
we feel awkward and shameful talking about it .
dp : when a guy is happily married , no matter what happens at work , no matter what happens in the rest of the day , there &apos;s a shelter when you get home , there &apos;s a knowledge knowing that you can hug somebody without them throwing you downstairs and saying , &quot; &quot; get your hands off me . &quot; &quot; being married is like having a color television set .
and there &apos;s all this crap sort of circling around it , dust and stuff .
but what if you had to drive four hours to charge your phone because you had no reliable source of electricity ?
he was talking about the space aliens .
one way to change our genes is to make new ones , as craig venter has so elegantly shown .
it can be in a basket . it can be in a loaf pan , but we pan it .
ca : but to make this happen , you have to look at each part in the chain — the police , who else ?
i also see a world where we can erase unwanted memories .
but it &apos;s also useful , because it tells us that extreme simplicity in movement rules at the individual level can result in a great deal of complexity at the level of the group .
bia &apos;s school stayed in place .
but let &apos;s start off by remembering that darwin showed how we &apos;re the outcome of four billion years of evolution .
it was around this time we went from 1k to 16k , which was quite the leap .
now , like doc edgerton , a scientist himself , science became art — an art of ultra-fast photography .
for every four barrels of oil that we consume , we only discover one .
the more i thought about it , i realized , no , it &apos;s still important .
and in just four weeks , the brain learns to process this new sensation and acquires a new sensory pathway — like a new sense .
it gives it information . by adding information to matter , it gives it a function that &apos;s different than without that structure .
but we also know it &apos;s only through experiment that we &apos;ll discover exactly how to run a low carbon city , how to care for a much older population , how to deal with drug addiction and so on .
as a matter of fact , we added to the contract .
( applause ) we &apos;ve hired and trained hundreds of facilitators to help guide people through the experience .
he said , &quot; &quot; what do you think it &apos;s like trying to run a country with 400 kinds of cheese ? &quot; &quot; but at the same time , we realize that our products are not safe and healthy .
mk : yeah , we were friends for a long time .
and this is about good taste , good traditions .
true story . true story .
we don &apos;t know the details of how this works , but we do know then that foxo genes can impact the lifespan of people .
if you look at our ancestors , the neanderthals and the homo erectus , our immediate ancestors , they &apos;re confined to small regions of the world .
what you just heard is &quot; &quot; skylife &quot; &quot; by david balakrishnan .
she said things she &apos;d always needed to say .
we also recognize that a lot of the products that we make — those videos and so forth — you know , they don &apos;t reach everybody , and so we &apos;ve been fostering projects that reach people outside of academia , and outside of the choir that most ecologists preach to .
this is why basically you have all this creative mistrust between the representatives and those whom they represent .
over the course of last year , open-source hardware hackers have come up with multiple models for usable , linux-based mobile phones , and the earth phone could spin off from this kind of project .
the greek word poem , it just means &quot; &quot; a made thing , &quot; &quot; and poetry is a set of techniques , ways of making patterns that put emotions into words .
so that &apos;s an asset because if you &apos;ve got to deal with the crash protection issues of the automobile , forget it — you &apos;re never going to fly it .
now , the irony is , of course , that every large company started off as a small , entrepreneurial company .
i was at one of their fundraising events earlier this year , and i was inspired to give a one-off donation when i remembered that my firm offers to match the charitable contributions its employees make .
she &apos;s here . she &apos;s also a doctor .
it &apos;s real stuff .
this is an old bicycle tube , which gives you a broad rubber band , two safety pins .
we actually met on mission blue i in the galapagos .
i get to read about mother-in-law jokes from mesopotamia from 3,500 years ago .
i &apos;m going to make a cut right there .
and you can see here that what it &apos;s doing is it &apos;s recording my eyes every time i blink .
there were no motel 6 &apos;s or howard johnsons for me .
and then the kids graduate , and you have no responsibility any more — that &apos;s very good , too .
and that will stop reusing a syringe 20 or 30 times .
i asked them to name me just 20 .
so you ask yourself , if education has become so much more expensive , has it become so much better ?
think enron , madoff , the mortgage crisis .
it &apos;s an acknowledgment of need or fallibility .
if you look over the past couple decades at the returns to capital — in other words , corporate profits — we see them going up , and we see that they &apos;re now at an all-time high .
and i pressed her , and i asked her , &quot; why did you come back and get your care here ? &quot;

( laughter ) and we are certainly not waiting for that check to drop through the letterbox before we start , and most importantly of all , we are not daunted by the sophisticated arguments that say , &quot; these small actions are meaningless in the face of tomorrow &apos;s problems , &quot; because i have seen the power of small actions , and it is awesome .
i &apos;m being a bit mysterious for those of you out there . what were they accused of ?
but not from a top-down institutional perspective , rather from the perspective of a refugee .
and then , finally talk a little bit about a third way , about another technology , which is probably better than anything we have , but which — there hasn &apos;t been any enthusiasm for adoption precisely because people are so enamored with the current car seat solution . ok .
but since it didn &apos;t happen here , we can put it out of our minds , and people like jenny mccarthy can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like &quot; &quot; oprah &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; larry king live . &quot; &quot; and they can do it because they don &apos;t link causation and correlation .
that i happen to own that fits inside a cereal box , and could maybe , without even touching their bird , i swear , get a perfect 3d scan . and i &apos;m even willing to sign pages saying that i &apos;ll never let anyone else have it , except for me in my office , i promise .
open your eyes , ezra .
and the jar of pills he had , he said , were the tiniest little pills he could find , so small you could barely see them .
the second shock feels less painful , because you get a bit used to it .
there are some people who are very good at this .
motorola makes the most widely used one , and you can see that they &apos;re used by secret service , they &apos;re used in combat , it &apos;s a very , very common standard in the u.s. and elsewhere .
and it &apos;s based on the cochlear of your ear , able to pick up internet , wireless , television signals and radio signals , in the same chip .
you know what you are ? a crocodile .
well , we actually surveyed over 120 individuals , and the results were mixed .
according to relevant researchers , 83 percent of the population of this planet lives in the societies without independent press .
experiments suggest that lightning could be the next gps .
so i decided — i had this crazy epiphany at two in the morning .
look at the strength and the will radiating from this woman .
simple rule number one : understand what others do .
bd : novocure &apos;s also working on lung cancer as the second target .
it &apos;s not enough to simply write people off .
look in the gray areas , and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there — yeah , it &apos;s amazing . there &apos;s nothing there . it &apos;s no trick .
we tell ourselves a story about other people &apos;s lives , and these stories make us feel terrible because they &apos;re designed to make us feel terrible .
the encyclopedia is just one in a long line of arabic erotica , much of it written by religious scholars .
they never even got out of their clothes .
lots of scientists did a lot of work to make crispr happen , and what &apos;s interesting to me is that these scientists are being supported by our society .
and as the father was administering these instructions , a car drove by , slowly , and just after it passed the father and the teenagers , a hand went out from the front passenger window , and — &quot; &quot; bam , bam ! &quot; &quot; — killing the father .
he actually raises money , solves my disputes .
we have seen a revolutionary breakthrough in the emergence of these exponential curves .
and if i want to explore the world — uh-oh , romo &apos;s tired — if i want to explore the world with romo , i can actually connect him from any other ios device .
not only are nba players ridiculously tall , they are ludicrously long .
people have found the collective as the slime mold finds the oats .
and then i was looking at my good work , and what i was doing is i was cutting the forests around here in b.c.
ka : it seems to me , among other things , a lovely piece of civic infrastructure .
and then , as he was doing that , he made an accidental click by hitting the touchpad — you &apos;ll see him do that .
and it is , to prevent rickets and so on .
and so , what did they test her for ?
we made progress in a lot of the areas like automated harvesting and efficient lighting .
now , this is subject to a lot of debate and controversy .
so again this is what they can see under the microscope .
her mother &apos;s doing everything she can .
this would tell you , you don &apos;t have my permission to send this image out .
( laughter ) by far .
you know , maybe it &apos;s not just humans at the right side of this chain that &apos;s duncey .
any one of you who gardens knows that there is something called the root-shoot ratio , and plants need to keep the root mass in some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy .
we &apos;re going to force you to act against your will , to bend to our will . &quot; &quot; then , number two , we keep these rules a secret from the dog .
is it being directed effectively ?
and so that &apos;s not going to be a solution that &apos;s going to get us global with biologic tissue .
and today , artists armed with that emotion , are grasping anatomy from the medical world , and are reinvigorating it through art in the most imaginative ways .
but originally the significance of the bindi is to symbolize the third eye between the spiritual world and the religious world .
that &apos;s what i call globalization chinese style .
so i set out to study electrical engineering and robotics , and my end-of-studies project was about building a robot called er-1 — it looked like this — that would collect information from its environment and proceed to follow a white line on the ground .
what we do is the exact opposite .
as you can see , the brain area is going up and down in each one of them , but the responses are very different , and not in sync .
and then marge deton .
this last fall , i went to the snow and ice data center in boulder , colorado , and talked to the researchers here in monterey at the naval postgraduate laboratory .
this is , of course , unless your whole life is about being secure .
what was my calling ? what should i do ?
the reason is you never go and bother to ask the losers who also purchased lottery tickets and didn &apos;t end up winning the prize .
none of the straight lines are actually straight .
but they get a lot more information about what you do online , what you like , what interests you .
they send it out for amateur rocketeers , and it said in there do not ever heat a mixture of potassium perchlorate and sugar .
his name was john belk . some of you will probably know him .
we then got to the last ancestor .
&#91; bbc news : &apos; end of virginity &apos; if women drive , saudi cleric warns &#93; ( laughter ) and only then we realized it &apos;s so empowering to mock your oppressor .
let &apos;s now see how the rest and the west compares in terms of how rich you are .
and one story i want to tell you about is how can we find targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder — a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear .
and civic leaders should deploy sensors and civic drones to detect rogue drones , and instead of sending killer drones of their own up to shoot them down , they should notify humans to their presence .
they made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work .
easy , right ?
it was all i did .
&#91; jennifer brea is sound-sensitive .
and you can see we got a guy from — who &apos;s just a fanatic about dinosaurs to do the sculpting for us , down to the spoon-shaped teeth and everything .
he comes back and instead of deciding that , well , now since i &apos;ve lost my leg , that second dream is over , he decides that he still has that dream of playing baseball , and he starts this group called vetsports , which now works with veterans all over the country and uses sports as a way of healing .
i &apos;m going to go off script and make chris quite nervous here by making this audience participation .
why would i want to go back to a body that was so broken ?
they don &apos;t represent what our views are .
what we &apos;re seeing in many of them is the rise of the youth bulge .
at 12,000 feet , where the air is thin , i once built two hole in the wall computers , and the children flocked there .
now , montel williams is an intelligent man .
for example , brazil — this beautiful country hosting tedglobal has the world &apos;s ugliest record .
and i would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice , that i was making a three-dimensional drawing of a horse that somehow moves in space .
and so that was the idea .
man 7 : after this bridge , first exit .
we should find out what they &apos;re doing and transfer that skill to other people . &quot; &quot; but i can tell you that absolutely is not happening today .
( applause ) oh , sorry .
they are generated by specific mechanisms that may make them predictable , perhaps controllable .
suddenly , we &apos;re seeing actions on the ground from local government . we &apos;re seeing this mainstreamed .
that would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint .
so i went back there with a 28 mm lens .
and countries with islam as the majority religion , all of them almost had six to seven children per woman , irregardless of the income level .
now , how does the most powerful country in the world handle these displaced people ?
( applause ) i like it . ( applause ) ( laughter ) dl : oh yeah , okay , in my family we had seven girls , four boys , we had two fiddles and one piano , and of course we were all fighting to play on the instruments , so dad and mom set a rule that you couldn &apos;t kick anyone off the instrument . you had to wait until they were finished , so of course , what we would do is we &apos;d get on the piano and you wouldn &apos;t even get off to eat , because you wouldn &apos;t want to give it up to your brother or sister , and they &apos;d wait and wait and wait , and it &apos;d be midnight
and it will cost you upwards of a billion dollars for that one success .
but i had this question .
it &apos;s extremely good at using available means to achieve a state in which its goal is realized .
and this is one of the great things about fruit flies .
and it actually happened again , with the fall of the berlin wall .
recording : ♫ daisy , daisy ♫ ♫ give me your answer do ♫ ♫ i &apos;m half crazy ♫ ♫ all for the love of you ♫ ♫ it can &apos;t be a stylish marriage ♫ ♫ i can &apos;t afford a carriage ♫ ♫ but you &apos;ll look sweet upon the seat ♫ ♫ of a bicycle built for two ♫ ak : so james surowieki has this idea of the wisdom of crowds , that says that a whole bunch of people are smarter than any individual .
the computer then talks to a machine — a computer-operated machine , a cad-cam machine — that can make a zillion different changes , at a moment &apos;s notice , because the computer is just a machine .
and the country that does this first will , in my view , leapfrog others in achieving a new economy even , an improved economy , an improved outlook .
let me give you two stats that seem like they &apos;re on opposite ends of the issue , but are actually two sides of the same coin .
so i just said , &quot; &quot; well , if that &apos;s the case , then i &apos;d like to leave . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and it never worked .
( laughter ) well , we would like to encourage all of you to do your part to help protect einstein &apos;s animal friends , and to do your part to help protect their homes that they live &#91; in &#93; .
republicans really dislike the democrats . we &apos;re changing .
state your name and age for the commission .
we all use wikipedia .
what about full knee replacements , from your data , made to measure , where all of the tools and guides are 3d printed ?
and the way i can figure that out is by looking at chunks , sequential chunks of binary information , and i look at the relationships between those chunks .
and i had the pleasure to work on the central plaza .
but it turns out that love is very strictly forbidden in the lower ranks of the guerrilla , so their romance was discovered and they were separated .
and the difference between performance and theater is huge .
and yet two random people will mate and have this child , and both of them have some pretty rotten genes , and the child is likely to come out to be average .
take your skin color , and celebrate it .
that &apos;s no longer the case . logging roads provide access to urban areas .
and it merges the stop sign and yield signs .
because at first i wanted — you know , i &apos;ve taken him on a couple of trips , but i wanted him to see people that live on a dollar a day or less .
bruno giussani : miguel , thank you for sticking to your time .
there are so many things to be happy about .
this is the grand cafe here in oxford .
it &apos;s no money down , and your utility bill decreases .
you &apos;re safe . it &apos;s fine .
earlier this year , with our friends from the imazon nonprofit here in brazil , we launched the first subnational social progress index .
and so i went to both — two race riots , one of which was the los angeles riot . and this next piece is from that .
take mexico , for example .
it &apos;s not completely gone . i &apos;m going to come back to that .
if you make some noise you can feel the effect .
it &apos;s a giant airbag .
but that all happened later .
it appears that the more secretions she &apos;s got , the more likely the baby is to suckle quickly .
these are the sounds you would expect , but they are also the sounds of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds screeching in the night , the high-pitched honest cries of children and the thunderous , unbearable silence .
they have invented narco-submarines and boats that are not detected by radar .
there &apos;s consequences for carbonate organisms .
but when it comes to our cities and thinking about how death fits in our cities , there &apos;s much less regulation and design and thought than we might imagine .
from regular , relative skydiving i went on to freeflying .
for doing this , i was incarcerated for a year in an assessment center which was actually a remand center . it was a virtual prison for young people .
and i &apos;m not really one for the warm , fuzzy feeling .
they sacrifice fun time . they sacrifice personal indulgence .
we can &apos;t stifle innovation in our business .
it &apos;s not linear . and our intuition is linear .
other creatures can enjoy them too .
this studies the circuitry in two people &apos;s brains that activates while they interact .
and then worked for the jerry brown administration .
my own child , i let that happen to . &quot; &quot; so that &apos;s an investigation of the negative imagination .
i found a couple in the work of matt groening , although matt groening told me later that he could not make my talk because it was a morning session and i gather that he is not an early riser .
she has this show right now at moma , where some of these early works are here on display at moma , on the walls .
but maybe mission blue can fill in that ocean that we can &apos;t see .
what do you think about your movie ?
yeah , the dad was really upset .
when the architects came , they brought us these things , and you &apos;ve probably seen things like this .
and what are the results ?
if we know what that set point is , we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow , and it will be when your challenges are higher than average and skills are higher than average .
so almost all the biology that we observe can be thought of as a series of problems and their corresponding solutions , and the first problem that every organ must solve is a continuous supply of nutrients to fuel all those cells of the body .
it &apos;s one of the largest organizations in the world for young people .
last year , i told you the story , in seven minutes , of project orion , which was this very implausible technology that technically could have worked , but it had this one-year political window where it could have happened .
and yeah , sub-atomic physics is deconstructive . you literally try to tear atoms apart to understand what &apos;s inside of them . but sculpture , from what i understand from great sculptors , is deconstructive , because you see a piece and you remove what doesn &apos;t need to be there .
these cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field , like a screen .
( laughter ) having a little bit of richard time . that &apos;s nice , that &apos;s good .
and those dreams are getting fulfilled .
now , up there , 20 feet above the stage , that &apos;s 10 trillion .
maybe applied for your driver &apos;s license , tried to do your taxes on your own .
so we ask the question again , &quot; &quot; how many straight lines can i draw through the point , but never meet the original line ? &quot; &quot; does someone want to guess ?
good question . there are two main reasons .
and first of all , you have to go with me for a second , and say , you know , you could take the word &quot; &quot; love &quot; &quot; out of a lot of things in our society , put the word &quot; &quot; design &quot; &quot; in , and it still works , like this quote here , you know . it kind of works , you know ?
i was asked last year to give a speech at the oslo freedom forum .
what do we find now ?
i assessed how long they were going to stay and how much it would take to feed them .
or die alone ?
the sound you &apos;re hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close .
now , we &apos;ve all seen a lot of tedtalks online , so let &apos;s watch one now with the sound turned off and the closed captioning turned on .
&#91; &quot; &quot; evict twitter &quot; &quot; &#93; somebody sent me this photo a few weeks ago , and it shows what is happening on the ground in san francisco , and i think you can actually try to understand that through looking at a map like this .
so my favorite visual effect in the movie is the one i &apos;m about to show you .
when you leave the opera house , you &apos;ll find there &apos;s braille signage in the lifts .
okay , you &apos;ve got something ? one more thing .
moving on from this , the next person to explore this field was a gentleman called hans jenny in the 1970s .
i wondered , what work ?
some of what we fear , i suspect , we fear in common .
and unbelievably , in 40 years , i was the first indian to be honored .
i think we should make this even more explicit .
so , that primal medium , which your brain is exquisitely wired for ...
the first one is we &apos;ve targeted the intraspecies communication system .
well , it might look a little bit like the 4,000 community-interest companies that have sprung up in the u.k. over the last five years and a similar rise in b corporations in the united states , enterprises that have ecological and social goals written into their constitution at their heart — companies , in fact , like this one , ecosia .
collaborator : i felt really sad when he died .
in addition , there can be some infectious agents that can also cause autism .
they checked .
design thinking is a process for innovation and problem solving .
&quot; &quot; i recall one patient who was at that point no more than a skeleton encased in shrinking skin , unable to speak , his mouth crusted with candida that was resistant to the usual medications .
they &apos;re good for the environment because they enable no-till farming , which leaves the soil in place , getting healthier from year to year — slso keeps less carbon dioxide going from the soil into the atmosphere .
and so , for example , let &apos;s take jupiter .
if you didn &apos;t , you failed .
she looked at me , and she said , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re exactly the person i need to talk to .
every time a forest is cut down , every time a marsh is filled in , it is a potential lab that goes with it , and which we will never , ever recover .
computers ! what about computers ?
it looks like a horse . it must be a horse .
and yet , the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn &apos;t silent .
they send little pulses of electricity down their processes to each other , and where they contact each other , those little pulses of electricity can jump from one neuron to the other .
why are you fighting so hard not to be yourself ?
don &apos;t create a problem for us , for manufacturing , for application , then we have to buy new companies , we have to buy our competitors , we have to do all kinds of things because you sold too many widgets .
this makes it a remarkably easy and powerful system to use .
there were just 254 left .
he would know what time the sun would rise , and what time it would set .
it &apos;s a space that is playful in its own way , and also purposeful , and in that space , the cartoons are different .
in many parts of sub-saharan africa , the droughts are so much worse .
it &apos;s the romantic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
i kept looking , and i looked at the far end of the town in mountain home , and there was a small trailer park .
what if we put holly into the same context as humans ?
so you say , yeah , well , what are really the chances of this happening ?
( laughter ) and here is our factory in cape town where we make horses .
there were a lot of them .
we have identified over 400 species of bees in pennsylvania .
on the other hand , you &apos;re doing something new , no one &apos;s ever done before , you get it completely wrong . how should you be treated ?
and our new project is having the inmates and ourselves learn how to raise the oregon spotted frog which is a highly endangered amphibian in washington state and oregon .
our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work , they should be able to choose between at least a handful of different cities that were all competing to attract new residents .
i can photograph it from any angle , and it will still look 2d .
but anyway , i think we need to beat them again .
together they grow their own food .
in fact , it was so successful that there &apos;s no way that these days you could make a book like this .
we get to exercise some ancient , ancient drives .
they &apos;ve incurred violent infractions by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners .
and also it takes them forever to act on cells .
this is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine .
i really want to live in a world where disability is not the exception , but the norm .
three-fourths of our oil fuel is transportation .
and he was going to speak at the high school next door to us .
thank you .
we use these things as stopgaps for things that we can &apos;t explain .
let &apos;s do the reflection in x first , followed by the rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise .
we go to magic shows in order to be fooled .
so for example , action unit 12 , it &apos;s not a hollywood blockbuster , it is actually a lip corner pull , which is the main component of a smile .
and what you see are substantial improvements of their immediate memory , of their ability to remember things after a delay , of their ability to control their attention , their language abilities and visual-spatial abilities .
and the wonderful elation that we had when we finally completed it .
now , this suggests that if you could just block waterborne transmission , you could cause disease organisms to shift from the right-hand side of that graph to the left-hand side of the graph .
that eventually we &apos;ll train monkeys to do , or cells or robots , or maybe not even need to do it at all , i was off running the future of the residency program , which is really the future of medicine . &quot; &quot; and they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back .
in africa last year , africans ate 600 million wild animals , and consumed two billion kilograms of bush meat .
unfortunately , empirical data , good , hard stats , don &apos;t exist , and therefore to prove my point , i first of all had to find some proxy way of uncovering how much food was being wasted .
and they kind of took me into the farm and showed me what it was like to live and work .
that &apos;s great , except the places that have malaria really bad , they don &apos;t have health care systems .
and if you &apos;re a fish , and you haven &apos;t gotten your glob in the morning , you &apos;re going to get it in the afternoon , because they &apos;ve got your number .
we are coming out of 50 years , most unusual years , of history in which we have had a totally mono-polar world , in which every compass needle for or against has to be referenced by its position to washington — a world bestrode by a single colossus .
that will blow away a lot of the opposition .
we have charted our love for our child over time .
when you eat healthier , manage stress , exercise and love more , your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen .
and it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question , and it &apos;s extremely hard to answer .
so that people could have something more than just sms ?
the myth of national identity and the vocabulary of coming from confuses us into placing ourselves into mutually exclusive categories .
our enemies shall talk themselves to death , and we will fight them with their own confusion .
this is where gut decisions come from .
we saw geysers coming out .
and for the purposes of this talk , i wanted to isolate just a part of a project that &apos;s even a part of a project that touches a little bit on this theme of architectural special effects , and it happens to be our current obsession , and it plays a little bit with the purging and adding of distraction .
you know , someone sitting next to you in a seat — that &apos;s ok because you &apos;re in a theater , but if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you , you &apos;d freak out .
why is it important to reboot ? what does the red represent ?
so we &apos;d say things like , let &apos;s agree that you &apos;re going to sell 57 widgets per week .
your heart gets more blood flow .
and then i realized i have no idea how we &apos;re going to solve this problem , but i do know one thing : we have got to change the tone of this conversation .
but i think it &apos;s worth the effort , because the alternative , to blindly fight all hackers , is to go against the power you cannot control at the cost of stifling innovation and regulating knowledge .
we &apos;re living in an era of scientific creationism , 9 / 11 conspiracy theories , psychic hotlines , and a resurgence of religious fundamentalism .
governments and civil societies are experimenting with new approaches .
but a place , i think , where the effort is really worthwhile is where people are wrestling with quite serious problems — things like education or security or finance or health .
i was frozen by fear , curled up in the corner of my pitch-black closet clutching my gay grenade , and moving one muscle is the scariest thing i have ever done .
it was a joke .
thank you very much .
so basically , every time we feel that we are on the brink of peace , the conflict explodes again .
it has to do with the favelas , the slums — whatever you call it , there are different names all over the world .
by invisible , i mean it doesn &apos;t absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum .
mom says , &quot; &quot; if they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them , you must always say , &apos; nothing . &apos; and if they insist , say , &apos; whatever you mind to give me . &apos; &quot; &quot; this was the nature of being at that table .
thank you very much .
perhaps the tremendous progress we &apos;ve made over the last century by a series of forces are , in fact , accelerating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of abundance .
so no ego problems .
so i &apos;m very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross-section of my work that i &apos;ve done on the polar regions .
ca : to a lay person it seems like he has certain things to offer the u.s. , the government , you , others , in terms of putting things right and helping figure out a smarter policy , a smarter way forward for the future .
we can understand how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation that was set down 13.72 billion years ago — and yet , we can do calculations today to predict how it will look and it matches .
i guess we could make a glow chicken .
the driving cities in the sun belt , the dallases and the phoenixes and , sorry , atlanta , these cities are not appearing on the list .
in my mind , and in my dreams every night i chagall-man float over the city twirl and swirl with my toes kissing the floor .
there will be stronger storms and greater flooding .
but to a liberal , it sounds like this dog is running for the republican nomination .
that sense of hope , we &apos;re going to hold ,
we want to stop that gene from turning on , fusing those hands together , so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand , like the archaeopteryx .
only when women have critical mass in every department at your companies , including building platforms from the ground up , will the conversations about priorities and solutions change .
however , i also think it &apos;s got to do with the fact that bats come out at night , and we don &apos;t really understand them . we &apos;re a little frightened by things that can perceive the world slightly differently than us .
and this is something that a lot of americans want .
( music ) ♫ i don &apos;t understand myself , ♫ ♫ why they keep talking of love , ♫ ♫ if they come near me , ♫ ♫ if they look into my eyes and kiss my hand . ♫ ♫ i don &apos;t understand myself , ♫ ♫ why they talk of magic , ♫ ♫ that no one withstands , ♫ ♫ if he sees me , if he passes by . ♫ ♫ but if the red light is on ♫ ♫ in the middle of the night ♫ ♫ and everybody listens to my song , ♫ ♫ then it is plain to see . ♫ ♫ my lips , they give so fiery a kiss , ♫
inca sculptures are regarded as treasures in british museums , while shakespeare is translated into every major language of the earth .
( applause ) ( boomerang noises ) it was coming straight for me . i had to . it was , yeah .
the truth was my grandfather took me to parades , we had lots of those .
and so what we see , i think , is that small , collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope .
these people don &apos;t mind that i once worked as a singing waitress to help pay for college .
we only get one , and wow , did we ever get a good one .
what release finally , the embrace : though we were wary — it seemed so audacious — how much unspoken joy there was in that affirmation of equality and communion , no matter how much misunderstanding and pain had passed between you by then .
would you like a better system ?
and to remind you that here is an example in which architecture actually did something .
one value of older people is that they are increasingly useful as grandparents for offering high-quality childcare to their grandchildren , if they choose to do it , as more young women enter the workforce and as fewer young parents of either gender stay home as full-time caretakers of their children .
my background should have led me to a different direction .
mr : thank you very much indeed , cynthia kenyon .
but i come to this work after a long history as a social justice activist , and so i &apos;m really interested in the ways that people talk about nonfiction storytelling as though it &apos;s about more than entertainment , as though it &apos;s about being a catalyst for social action .
much of the debate in the u.s. has been about metadata .
that conflict , that tension , will be with us forever , that sometimes it wants to do what it wants to do , and sometimes it &apos;s going to do things for us .
actually , it &apos;s a small manufacturing plant set up by grameen danone , a joint venture between grameen bank of muhammad yunus and the food multinational danone to make high-quality yogurt in bangladesh .
and then back to simplicity again .
that means there &apos;s no waiting for chemical reactions to take place , no need to use reagents that can run out and no need to be an expert to get actionable information .
we &apos;ve heard a lot about what they can and can &apos;t do .
within a year , everybody over 40 was dead .
think about ipods compared to stereos .
read that great piece in the new yorker about how our echo boomers , 19 to 25 , over in iraq taught each other how to do sys admin work , over the internet in chat rooms .
how risky is this ?
what we need are for people to care , to actually go use it , just like they &apos;ve cared enough to use kiva to make those connections .
and then when it &apos;s not using it , it actually can roll it down into its head just like the headlights on your lamborghini .
in that year , we are not available for any of our clients .
they assumed two percent , and that made it a pretty hopeless story , because population growth was two and a half .
and who would talk to terrorists ?
our vice president of operation kissing the board . obviously very , very excited .
and i remember this plan , born out of frustration from a kid who kept calling me &quot; &quot; yogi , &quot; &quot; then pointed at my tummy and said , &quot; &quot; too many picnic baskets . &quot; &quot; turns out it &apos;s not that hard to trick someone , and one day before class , i said , &quot; yeah , you can copy my homework , &quot; and i gave him all the wrong answers that i &apos;d written down the night before .
there are entrepreneurs in the netherlands that produce them , and one of them is here in the audience , marian peeters , who &apos;s in the picture .
so the sweet spot is between 5 and 13 .
he &apos;s going to listen and be really interested .
now , how do i know that i &apos;m right about this somewhat confusing poem ?
people seem to think politics is sexy .
there i would hear people say my father was a &quot; &quot; moudjahid &quot; &quot; and that means &quot; &quot; fighter . &quot; &quot; later on , in france , i loved eavesdropping on grownups &apos; conversations , and i would hear all sorts of stories about my father &apos;s previous life , especially that he had &quot; &quot; done &quot; &quot; world war ii , that he had &quot; &quot; done &quot; &quot; the algerian war .
so as i shake this ketchup bottle , i get some true sensory feedback as the function of time in the bottom row .
but if you don &apos;t need it , and somebody else gives you the shock , it &apos;s not a good thing .
i &apos;ve been simplifying things for 30 years .
we need to take a really positive view .
the brain could only change within certain set limits .
if you have a good wi-fi connection or 3g , this process is very , very quick .
he voted in favor of the bill , in favor of a law that would allow businesses to not serve me .
l-dopa &apos;s a drug , as you know , given for treating parkinson &apos;s disease , which is related to a decrease in dopamine .
you have to take 1,000 pictures per second to see this .
i think you might get a random jumble of letters that looks like this .
my doctor told me that in order to heal my brain , i had to rest it .
unencumbered by clinical responsibilities , unwilling to take no for an answer from those bureaucracies that tend to crush patients , and with an unparalleled ability for information retrieval honed through years of using google .
peter diamandis : probably the most difficult thing that i had to do was raise the capital for this . it was literally impossible .
it &apos;s a business plan for a corporation .
okay , now why then is this curious reluctance and curious hostility to consciousness ?
for example , the psychologist daniel oppenheimer , a few years ago , teamed up with high school teachers .
&quot; please get fisa right . &quot;
and he was working on gyroscopes ; he has a number of patents for that kind of thing .
so , these are early examples in the lab of emerging technologies to digitize fabrication . computers that don &apos;t control tools but computers that are tools , where the output of a program rearranges atoms as well as bits .
and here &apos;s what that means for us .
so very carefully we had to mechanically scrape off all the wax .
tk : that hand &apos;s not so good for clapping .
other ones are kind of going like this . all right .
because what happens in a singly-linked list — this is trying to remove an existing entry from a list — and there &apos;s a difference between if it &apos;s the first entry or whether it &apos;s an entry in the middle .
they were reeling from the earthquake , they were reeling from cholera that was brought in by un peacekeepers and still hasn &apos;t been eradicated .
so here &apos;s an image of red blood cells , and now we can actually map where the hemozoin and where the malaria parasites are inside those red blood cells .
it &apos;s important for us to grow organically .
but he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me to work directly for him in the white house .
it has 300 options , i &apos;m paying for 300 ; i &apos;m using only three but i &apos;m willing to live with it , therefore it is scaling up .
the message reads , &#91; arabic &#93; &quot; you can crush the flowers , but you can &apos;t delay spring . &quot;
all this striving for security , in fact , has made you much more insecure because now you have to watch out all the time .
they were sitting at a table . they were brought together for us .
so , close to 200,000 people a day migrate from the rural to the urban areas .
it &apos;s very ironic .
and i &apos;ve been thinking a lot about what i have learned over these last particularly 11 years with v-day and &quot; &quot; the vagina monologues , &quot; &quot; traveling the world , essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet to stop violence against women .
in fact , when we run the numbers , it looks like it &apos;ll take us at least 15 years before we can fully finance all our conservation efforts .
and i &apos;m only showing you a little bit of this .
thank you frans de waal , wherever you are , i love you and i &apos;d give anything to meet you .
and this is what we spend a lot of our time doing , is just making sure that we can keep up with this kind of traffic load .
and essentially , the oceans are breathing through the southern ocean .
you &apos;re wrong , because it &apos;s the opposite .
the stories of the colonoscopies were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
the only way you can do that is to not swim on top of the water .
the way i look back in the past is by using the fossilized remains of deepwater corals .
and i was getting it all on film and i was recording it , and i was thinking , &quot; &quot; this is it . this is the possibility of it maybe working .
dreams are a form of consciousness on this definition .
so , there &apos;s this guy , right ? victorian era .
and i would like to make a case to you that over the years since we first developed atomic weaponry , until this very moment , we &apos;ve actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world that &apos;s characterized by two phases , which i &apos;m going to go through with you right now .
the first one is harm / care .
jay chiat is a glutton for punishment , and he hired me to do a house for him in the hamptons .
but the bird , instead of flying away , goes flop , flop , flop and lands on my head .
that &apos;s how the system &apos;s supposed to work .
ck : yes , that &apos;s right .
there is different type of barbaria .
and then sort of through a process of wandering around , i got to the thought that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars , in a way that is convenient and affordable , you could get to a solution .
number one : china feels as if it &apos;s been humiliated at the hands of the west through a hundred years of history , beginning with the opium wars .
don &apos;t be daunted . just do your job .
i started a foundation to bet on these good people doing good things .
( laughter ) &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve misjudged this women , &quot; &quot; thought mr. dickens .
but what i want to point out is you can buy this from itunes .
you &apos;re going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so , i gave myself the job title of ted custodian for a reason , and i will promise you right here and now that the core values that make ted special are not going to be interfered with .
he was trying to tell people how they should live through the medium of sermons , the classic medium of delivery of religions .
and there &apos;s evan .
and so i &apos;ll just go get them .
and sometimes it &apos;s about a legacy of the neighborhood , like in morrisania , about the jazz history .
so when i went through the data , i had very surprising results , because i found that four out of the five marinating ingredients actually inhibited the carcinogen formation .
how many inventors and untold entrepreneurs live out this phenomenon ?
and fundamentally , it &apos;s a story about how starting as very small children and continuing out all the way to the greatest accomplishments of our culture , we get the world right .
i don &apos;t see anybody actually being able to do that very effectively .
what i &apos;m showing you again here is this map of the human microbiome project data , so each point represents a sample from one body site from one of 250 healthy adults .
i recognize the pain they caused to others , for which there can be no forgiveness , but the pain they caused to me , there is , &quot; &quot; she said .
and if not , can you make yourself smart again ?
those girls have never touched google .
today i want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have , which is the choice overload problem .
and afghanistan , afghanistan , we think has probably stopped polio repeatedly .
eh : not bad .
we don &apos;t know how far it will go , but it &apos;s going on .
he had a bold idea that — what he called the cognitive trade-off hypothesis .
so here &apos;s the situation .
i like the idea of collaboration with people like that because it pushes you .
we are policing the world , and how are we doing that ?
bob dylan is 23 years old , and his career is just reaching its pinnacle .
war and malnutrition kills people together with hope .
and the reason it does is not because of the clever encryption .
now , i know what you &apos;re thinking .
ok , that &apos;s fair enough .
the next bit , we &apos;d chartered a pretty elderly russian plane to fly us up to a town called khatanga , which was the sort of last bit of civilization .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve had these people approach you before .
i have faith , for instance , that peace in the middle east is possible despite the ever-accumulating mass of evidence to the contrary .
so how we use yeast in the future is going to be really interesting .
so these are a couple of instrumentalists .
everest is an extreme environment .
that &apos;s what the experience of the last 20 years has been .
on the other end of the spectrum , some were so sick they had to live in complete darkness , unable to tolerate the sound of a human voice or the touch of a loved one .
maybe some of you have received an email that says something like , &quot; &quot; hi , i &apos;m a nigerian banker , and i &apos;d like to give you 53 billion dollars because i like your face . &quot; &quot; or funnycats.exe , which rumor has it was quite successful in china &apos;s recent campaign against america .
if someone was to throw an egg at the sistine chapel , we &apos;d all go crazy .
( music ) and so they &apos;re beautiful , but this libertarian has some important lessons he wants us to learn from this .
and so we prospered in a way that no other animal has .
and it didn &apos;t stop there .
so after i returned home , i received word that one member of the family had been shot 30 times in the face .
and then we took these flies and allowed them to make choices .
but in this country , where the government apparently does not feel compelled to provide health care for citizens , ( laughter ) we &apos;ve taken a very different approach .
all four of my oars broke before i reached halfway across .
but this one is — the bible says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month , and more than that , you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat .
so , why is that ?
it may just take the right crazy idea .
so in this image , what you can see is that everything smaller than five nanometers is going from the blood , through the kidney , into the urine , and everything else that &apos;s bigger is retained .
( audience : random . ) michael sandel : at random . you would do it by lottery .
but when you get specific , when you actually ask about the actual taxing and spending issues under consideration , people are remarkably centrist , they &apos;re remarkably open to compromise .
so every second , half of the library of congress is swooshing around in this machine . it &apos;s a big machine .
and you all know that if you are going to determine whether you &apos;re related to your brother or your sister , you can &apos;t do it by looking at differences .
now , technology has changed a lot since the victrola days .
so with all these theatric elements , this pushes me in another role , and that would be , possibly , the dramaturge .
we &apos;ve discovered things like , for example , rna interference only a few years ago , and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work .
so let &apos;s make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana .
just think of sebastian and how he bought the cat to influence his .
the person i believed for half of my life to have superpowers suddenly needed help to get dressed or to cut food .
the good news is i &apos;m very aware of my responsibilities to get you out of here because i &apos;m the only thing standing between you and the bar .
not enough to stabilize the climate .
who &apos;s not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings — if you &apos;re different from all the other beings ?
and then you &apos;d see an image of britney spears to remind you of this funny anecdote you want to tell .
take the planet venus .
( music ) but basically , it &apos;s just a b , with four sads .
( laughter ) so , i took a look at my life , a hard look at my life , and i saw some things very disturbing . ( laughter )
and i don &apos;t mean the whole economy , because to grow an economy of india to the size of u.k. — that &apos;s a piece of cake , with one billion people .
on the other side , there is this girl .
and some people think that &apos;s a good thing .
right ? and then i realized , that was on my website , and then it said , like , you know , the quote was attributed to me and i thought , oh , i said something , you know , in an interview .
it &apos;s got a remarkably clear yes / no answer , and just requires phenomenal grunt .
i hope that you will take a look at it .
( laughter ) but , you know , i could pop a book on in the middle of the night , and — ( laughter ) ( applause ) now , the kurzweil reader is simply a program on my laptop .
they would not leave me alone until i let them have a piece , but it was not a good one . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) well , it occurred to me that i should invite dr. robicsek to lecture at wofford college on — what else ?
education is often of poor quality .
and if they &apos;re on a smartphone on google , they &apos;ve got access to more knowledge and information than president clinton did 15 years ago .
&quot; &quot; strange , &quot; &quot; he agreed .
i &apos;m excited when i glimpse that kind of thinking writ large .
i &apos;m a historian by training , and what i study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy — meaning human bodies , animal bodies — how they dealt with bodily fluids , concepts of bodies ; how have they thought about bodies .
however , i longed to share my life with someone .
but yes there are some solutions .
and when this story posted , i ran to my computer to send it to the imf official .
yeah , you all have a body , right ?
it stayed here and tried not to move any part of its body .
next is maynard sipes .
guys , we have an issue .
if you look at birds , which live a long time , cells from the birds tend to be more resistant to a lot of different environmental stresses like high temperature or hydrogen peroxide , things like that .
and that begins to lift a heavy burden off the world &apos;s poor .
here &apos;s another case that i think is interesting .
what has changed our society has been wireless devices .
how important is this ?
it means that you have to save more today .
i don &apos;t quite mean that the golden rule itself is written in our genes , but you can go to a hunter gatherer society that has had no exposure to any of the great religious traditions , no exposure to ethical philosophy , and you &apos;ll find , if you spend time with these people , that , basically , they believe that one good turn deserves another , and that bad deeds should be punished .
he came up with our name and logo . we &apos;re mission motors .
now , years ago , when i was working at youtube , we were looking for ways to encourage more people to rate videos , and it was interesting because when we looked into the data , we found that almost everyone was exclusively using the highest five-star rating , a handful of people were using the lowest one-star , and virtually no one was using two , three or four stars .
i made a promise that the next time i would fly around the world , it would be with no fuel , independent from fossil energies , in order to be safe , not to be threatened by the fuel gauge .
if you remember what i told you about fls at the beginning , it &apos;s knowledge and skills .
( laughter ) okay . okay . oh , well .
now , in the 20th century we had a revolution that was initiated at the beginning of the 20th century , and which is still going on .
and i don &apos;t think that we should give up on beauty .
why don &apos;t we take it a little longer — maybe two hours instead of an hour — and have less of this intensity ? &quot; &quot; and the nurses told me two things .
how well are we doing determining what piece to move where ?
they just thought , &quot; &quot; well , we &apos;ll give a course of 10 .
and no tricky shit behind the thing . i mean , it &apos;s all — you &apos;ve got to be very honest with what you &apos;re doing if it really is going to work .
the idea is that the building blocks of the digital economy are connectivity and entrepreneurship .
and i think we probably do need to pay some more attention to that , because it &apos;s actually kind of fragile .
and at seven o &apos;clock every night , i took me some more girls , already corrupted .
they have learned their lesson . they will control .
nl : i am the peer of whoever i &apos;m talking to .
thank you .
unfortunately , i don &apos;t fly trans-atlantic business class often enough to know , or any other kind of business class really , but i assume that in business class , you don &apos;t hear many expressions of , you know , bigotry about racial groups or ethnic groups , because the people who are flying trans-atlantic business class are doing business with all these people ; they &apos;re making money off all these people . and i really do think that , in that sense at least , capitalism has been a constructive force , and more fundamentally , it &apos;s a non-zero-sumness that has been a constructive force in expanding people &apos;s realm of moral awareness . i think the non-zero-sum dynamic ,
sometimes i can stand before the world — and when i say this , transformation is a difficult and slow process — sometimes i can stand before the world and say , &quot; &quot; my name is chris abani .
ok , so , confession : i &apos;ve always been weirdly obsessed with advertising .
and different people will have different places they want it set .
so this is a picture of me holding one of the first watercolor paintings i ever made .
men have sex before marriage , and people more or less turn a blind eye .
in fact , nothing expresses that assumption more clearly than three simple numbers : 9-1-1 , which , of course , is the number for the emergency police operator here in canada and in the united states , where the average response time to a police 911 emergency call is about 10 minutes .
but the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first .
tbl : can you say &quot; &quot; now &quot; &quot; ?
as an absolute connection , it only works one way .
and on the other end of the spectrum , this is a microstructure .
( laughter ) and when she saw him , he was down on one knee , he had the ring out .
now we can take the words and start to build sentences out of them .
but then he decides , &quot; let me tweak my tactics a little bit . &quot;
so this is a plate of nachos .
there &apos;s something that it feels like to drink beer which is not what it feels like to do your income tax or listen to music , and this qualitative feel automatically generates a third feature , namely , conscious states are by definition subjective in the sense that they only exist as experienced by some human or animal subject , some self that experiences them .
they &apos;re all searching for their staircase .
office worker : got a ham and swiss on rye ? bm : no .
so i don &apos;t know , it started to become an interesting mix .
you degrade forests , you go beyond the boundary on land , you undermine the ability of the climate system to stay stable .
i pushed back .
if you really want great hamburger , it turns out it makes a difference if you align the grain .
it would have the interdisciplinarity of the ted conference .
that &apos;s one of the themes that sylvia reminds us about : understand this ocean of ours , this basic life support system , the dominant life support system on the planet .
and we &apos;d sing this old song . she didn &apos;t have a whole lot of energy , so i &apos;d sing , &quot; &quot; hey , hey ! &quot; &quot; and she &apos;d just answer back with , &quot; &quot; black-eyed susie . &quot; &quot; oh , hey , hey , black-eyed susie ! hey , hey , black-eyed susie !
and fortunately , in the course of this project , the transplant surgeons and the other people decided , forget common practice . we have to switch .
( laughter ) so in the studio , rather than drawing , we began to learn how to knit .
there is some modeling of ecosystems going on now .
and from , you know , fattushis , to taxistan to , you know , for the fashtoonks , botoxia , pashmina , khlintunisia , you know , we were able to take the city and make fun of this completely foreign , who are — what &apos;s going on over here ?
this is why i can wear my gho with pride .
but then i thought , oh , i &apos;m sending myself mixed messages .
maybe we don &apos;t recognize it every time , but we understand that it happens .
i do dream in x-ray . i see my projects in my sleep .
and this is just a very simple way of understanding what kind of innovation , what kind of different design we need .
literally hundreds of elevator rides were spent with me alone stuffing the pump into my spanx , hoping the doors wouldn &apos;t open unexpectedly .
and what hotel means , in kenya and india , is an eating-place .
talk to any astrophysicist .
as you get towards the 1970s , things are going to start to change .
some of them were toys . some of them were candy .
and if you don &apos;t know them , that &apos;s okay . most casual players probably do .
from my american perspective , when a paying customer makes a reasonable request based on her preferences , she has every right to have that request met .
it &apos;s just a question to use some techniques like the time lapse .
i know most people don &apos;t see it that way .
food can be there and people can &apos;t buy it .
jihad may at times take the form of fighting , but only sometimes , under strict conditions , within rules and limits .
take , for example , the incidents of suicide baiting .
here &apos;s another one . bang .
he went into a coma .
so there &apos;s some that are all about the toast , and all about the transformation of toast .
it took me weeks of internal thinking to try to reconcile the good reasons we had to assist that family and the soldier of fortune he became .
and it seemed like time that we become that way ourselves .
well , i thought there would be a podium , so i &apos;m a bit scared .
and in that sense , ballooning is a beautiful metaphor .
should i take vitamin c ? should i be taking wheatgrass ?
we hired a team of physicists , software engineers and biologists to work on this , and the first thing we had to work on was to create the human body , basically .
my story begins right here actually in rajasthan about two years ago .
just a few examples : an artist who paints with fluorescent physarum ; a collaborative team who are combining biological and electronic design with 3d printing technologies in a workshop ; another artist who is using the slime mold as a way of engaging a community to map their area .
but in fact , in a few years , organizations will know so much about us , they will be able to infer our desires before we even form them , and perhaps buy products on our behalf before we even know we need them .
i have to say , these are very hybrid places .
we were spending so much time with this leopard and getting to understand her individualism , her personal character , that maybe we were taking it a little bit far .
and just to give you a flavor of how well this works , this is the result we get when we analyze this for some familiar words .
what &apos;s missing ? what would i like to know ?
this is bringing together international — there are 50 nations involved in this mission — interagency — these development agencies — and private-public , to take on this kind of security .
the scientific embargo — if it &apos;s ever submitted to &quot; &quot; nature , &quot; &quot; hopefully , it will be accepted .
i &apos;m a member of the blackfeet nation .
it &apos;s a satellite that goes into space , which is probably the least open-source thing you can imagine , and it contains an arduino connected to a bunch of sensors . so if you know how to use arduino , you can actually upload your experiments into this satellite and run them .
they &apos;ve been bombed by the military , they &apos;ve been besieged , they &apos;ve been stormed by isis and they &apos;ve been cut off from supplies for years .
it &apos;s about the same as yours and mine .
i think , if you live with your head in the clouds every now and then , it helps you keep your feet on the ground .
let &apos;s look at the pantheon and the piazza della rotonda in front of it .
i &apos;ve been building topsoil .
you &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; aha , but new zealand has a higher gdp than chad ! &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a good point , well made .
i was a new mother and a young rabbi in the spring of 2004 and the world was in shambles .
so the country in the world with the highest social progress , the number one country on social progress is new zealand .
when did we originate as a species ?
so the 20th century , then , saw how much more complex reality was , but it also saw a positive side .
they couldn &apos;t hear what i was saying in the context of a 10 back-to-back powerpoint presentation conference .
soon , you &apos;ll be able to look inside your brain and program , control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there .
and i &apos;m not talking about all comedy here , because , clearly , there &apos;s plenty of humor that colors safely within the lines of what we already think and feel .
now we &apos;ve got the data , plus we have metadata .
you &apos;ve gone through hundreds of tv channels , just switching channel after channel , and then suddenly you actually stop on one .
i have won a lot of awards through this work .
leandro started a campaign using one of our tools , the pressure cooker , the same one that bia and jovita used , and the state government changed their minds before christmas eve .
so what you do one day is you take a pile of arrowheads , and you walk up to the one that can &apos;t speak very well , and you put the arrowheads down in front of him , hoping that he &apos;ll get the idea that you want to trade your arrowheads for finished arrows .
there &apos;s also a huge emotional impact .
rb : yeah , as it turned out , it proved to be the right move .
well , you know , sometimes the most important things come in the smallest packages .
the important question is , &quot; &quot; is it interesting ? &quot; &quot; and i follow this question , not worrying about &quot; &quot; is it music ? &quot; &quot; — not worrying about the definition of the thing that i &apos;m making .
then you can look at the ratios of those numbers , and figure out for a data center where you don &apos;t have that information , you can figure out , but maybe you only have one of those , you know the square footage , then you could figure out well , maybe the power is proportional .
in contrast , they will walk an extra mile to avoid people who are not having fun .
i received a poignant tweet .
well , we &apos;ve seen that that can &apos;t be true .
on the other , the non-u.s.-related threats out of those 54 , the other 42 of them , the prism program was hugely relevant to that , and in fact was material in contributing to stopping those attacks .
and she looked at me , and she said , &quot; &quot; but , aimee , that &apos;s not fair . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) ( applause ) and the incredible thing was she really meant it .
jb : it &apos;s so powerful . richard ford , who &apos;s won the pulitzer prize , says that dyslexia helped him write sentences .
it made it possible for us to take close-up pictures of people 100 kilomteres away , like this one . ( laughter ) people called us and asked , how is this man doing ?
and they &apos;re coming into the city by rail .
now i &apos;m going to play the burst for you .
from &apos; 83 to &apos; 95 : two percent per annum .
so if we had some way to stop this scaling — and so i picked up some shells on the beach . and i asked them , what is scaling ? what &apos;s inside your pipes ?
this is all done in between the ribs .
it &apos;s just love . that &apos;s all it is .
so we &apos;ve developed certain tactics and strategies to cover up .
the paper you &apos;re holding in your hand contains the details of iraqi civilians that died as result of the invasion .
thus 900,000 people either have died or have significant damage to their heart muscle .
and she makes them so they could either be broken up into payments , or they could be like these , which are leaves that can be payments .
pretty quickly i saw that if you had more than a few values you &apos;d never remember on the screen where things were .
for me , the design exercise always begins here with the periodic table , enunciated by another professor , dimitri mendeleyev .
because even through the squeaks of his hearing aids , his understanding of music was profound .
in june 2010 , internet changed my life forever .
and i says , &quot; &quot; well , try me . &quot; &quot; and then he said , &quot; &quot; but i don &apos;t believe that you can do this . &quot; &quot; so i said , &quot; &quot; ok . &quot; &quot; so , to cut a long story short , i went home , went underneath the microscope , and i crushed up a piece of glass , crushed it up .
the next moment , as soon as they finished and disappeared into the shadows , a young man with a propane lantern came on , hung it up on a tree , set up a curtain .
now , these ideas and these events allow us even to deconstruct iconic places that many of you have been to , like machu picchu .
i could feel the wind against my face and the beat of my racing heart as if it were happening in that very moment .
and maybe something else .
now , the balance that i try to fight for , i , as any good liberal , try to fight for first by looking to the government . total mistake , right ?
instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem , design the solution around what the human will do as well .
these legs that i was on , which i &apos;ll take out right now — i was the first person in the world on these legs .
i &apos;ll just take you to bangladesh for a minute .
the computer was cracked open .

i want to say , &quot; &quot; computer , let &apos;s design a car , &quot; &quot; and the computer shows me a car .
so , a patient can come in and actually blow into their device .
i mean kgb , and not just kgb , used to torture in order to actually get this data .
thank you .
then you can of course always go and see this guy .
it &apos;s the coolest stuff .
now , why would neuroscientists say that we don &apos;t just construct , we reconstruct ?
but some day , some day , maybe it &apos;s going to work .
so netra was stuck with 30 paintings of mine .
you see how resistant it is to those very ideas .
we can see them indirectly , because black holes wreak havoc on their environment .
she looked at me and i looked at her .

one on the extreme right is a photograph of an american footballer .
if we do more in a kind of a stupid way , the simplicity gets complex and , in fact , we can keep on doing it for a very long time .
and all of the muslim majority countries across the income are coming down , as do the christian majority countries in the middle income range .
a few energy geeks spread out across the room .
now , it &apos;s interesting , because we &apos;ve embraced this darwinian view of a continuity in physical evolution , this physical continuity .

so what this means now is that those traits we then look at and so readily see — facial features , skin color , hair structure — are not determined by single genes with big effects , but are determined by many different genetic variants that seem to vary in frequency between different parts of the world .
particularly , there &apos;s a place called europa , which is — europa is one of the moons of jupiter , where we see a very level ice surface , which looks as if it &apos;s floating on top of an ocean .

the spirit of these labs , it &apos;s open , it &apos;s positive , but , you know , sometimes when people think of us , the first thing that comes to mind is bio-safety , bio-security , all the dark side stuff .
and when these four cells work together in health and harmony , they create an extraordinary symphony of electrical activity , and it is this electrical activity that underpins our ability to think , to emote , to remember , to learn , move , feel and so on .

and in terms of the line of poetry , why does the poet use the word hare rather than rabbit ?

out of a list of 26 topics , salary is only number eight .
we &apos;ve taken this information and we &apos;ve made a mathematical model out of it .
and myth says that he had an audience with the oracle , and it foretold his destiny of greatness .
as a journalist , i think these stories of what people in power do when no one is watching , are precisely the stories that we need to tell .
and not only that , i am documenting it — documenting my own cultural shortcomings .
but i took a liking to them because they dwell on the fringes of society .
so i thought this morning i would try to be the optimist , and give reason to hope for the future of the internet by drawing upon its present .
something amazing happened during this shoot .
now here &apos;s the even more striking thing .
so 100 years ago , hormones had just been discovered , and people hoped that hormone treatments were going to cure aging and disease , and now instead we set our hopes on stem cells , genetic engineering , and nanotechnology .
oncosearch was a good example .
so think about it .
ok , so as a matter of fact , child number one is telling the truth , child number two is lying .
i was gaunt . i walked as though my legs were wooden .
in fact , we call first year science and engineering , typically around america , weed-out courses or barrier courses .
so as soon as i see a question about things i &apos;m afraid of , which might be earthquakes , other religions , maybe i &apos;m afraid of terrorists or sharks , anything that makes me feel , assume you &apos;re going to exaggerate the problem .

to deal with contradictions , for example , they add branching patterns and parallel patterns .
it should imagine a user .
and i found myself in front of an hr manager in 1999 , saying something i never imagined that i would say .

and he explained that ebola threatened everything that made us human .
so then we tried a blend , and in a blend combination we tried it against h5n1 , and we got greater than 1,000 selectivity index .
and this is the kind of thing that i got back .
many of you may remember the magic wall that we built in conjunction with perceptive pixel where we quite literally create an infinite wall .
de : that &apos;s a great question . we actually have no idea what the theoretical limits are of what kind of data the brain can take in .
so in the technological world , we don &apos;t have experience to judge models .
i could talk to you about it right now if i wanted to , because it unlocked it .
the other reason why i really like this is because it offers an alternative entry point into the complexity of science .
i come from a family that doesn &apos;t have a whole lot of money .
we make assumptions about so-called disabilities .
once we fix it , we just might solve this problem .

you have the crude oil .
a little , tiny guy walks along . more servo drives , lots of servo hacking , lots of mechanical stuff .
management of forests , transportation , the oceans , the melting of the permafrost .
so we were in front of a strange new cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently .
( laughter ) the microbes that cover us .
it shows very well that eyes can hear , and this is interesting to me because technology allows us to present sound to the eyes in ways that accentuate the strength of the eyes for seeing sound , such as the removal of time .
and here was the most intriguing result : the task allocation .
i went to turin in may .
to understand all this , i interviewed a top official from the ruling party in turkey , and i ask him , &quot; &quot; how do you do it ? &quot; &quot; they too use digital technology extensively , so that &apos;s not it .

after the fourth rejection , we requested reconsideration of the manuscript , because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology .
i knew nothing about wofford and even less about methodism , but i was reassured on the first day that i taught at wofford college to find , among the auditors in my classroom , a 90-year-old hungarian , surrounded by a bevy of middle-aged european women who seemed to function as an entourage of rhinemaidens .
captive breeding will be a major part of bringing back these species .
the first question is , how did the number of deaths per year from natural disaster , how did that change during the last century ?
so the project is going very , very well , and i urge you to check out the website and watch this space .

the gas that they used at first , in many cases , was oxygen .
can we observe them taking place in the natural world ?
the nurses , anesthesiologist , the surgeon , all the assistants are waiting around .
if they did , it probably was right there at ground zero .
and i think there &apos;s almost a paradox with those .
but , in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries , our language isn &apos;t allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want , the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable .
we spend so much time in this culture being driven and aggressive , and i spend a lot of time being those things too .
we haven &apos;t even started the american stockpile .
the other piece of good news , for a scientist at least , is that much remains to be discovered .
what we mean when we say those things is : i see you there .
you know , you would ask patients questions and some people would tell you , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t , don &apos;t , don &apos;t listen to what the patients said . &quot; &quot; we know that patients know and understand their bodies better , but these days we &apos;re trying to divorce them from that idea . we have to reconcile the patient &apos;s knowledge of their body with physician &apos;s measurements .
so he doesn &apos;t actually do anything himself .
across my residual limb are electrodes that measure the electrical pulse of my muscles .
turns out it wasn &apos;t so easy .

this number exploded with the great recession , but it turns out people actually like living this way .
and you have to , first you have to convince yourself .
we can see that they travel different countries , so if you focus on a problem locally , it &apos;s not going to help you .

so we can throw it out like that . let &apos;s reset it .
do you know that it takes years for a drug to go from an idea to being tested on cells in a laboratory , to animal studies , to then clinical trials on humans , finally to go through a regulatory approval process , to be available for your doctor to prescribe to you ?

we began with a small literacy class to read the koran , then a math class , then an english class , then computer classes .

( clicks ) thank you .
the thing is , this idea of chinese-american food doesn &apos;t exist only in america .
some poems even tell you that that is what they can do .
let me talk about my own experience .
we &apos;re going to start and realize that the entire visible universe , everything we can see in every direction with the hubble space telescope plus our other instruments , was once in a region that was smaller than an atom .
it &apos;s a very trivial thing .
we don &apos;t know what the atmospheres of these planets are like because the planets are so small and dim compared to their stars and so far away from us .
and if everything goes smoothly , one to two weeks from now you &apos;ll know where the epidemic was today .
and so folks like ami klin have developed methods to be able to take infants , small babies , and be able to use biomarkers , in this case eye contact and eye tracking , to identify an infant at risk .
how about 40 ? okay , it &apos;s a whole varied response .
it all started when we at cern saw something intriguing in our data : a hint of a new particle , an inkling of a possibly extraordinary answer to this question .
in northern california , we &apos;re beginning to take observations with the first 42 telescopes of the allen telescope array — and i &apos;ve got to take a moment right now to publicly thank paul allen and nathan myhrvold and all the teamseti members in the ted community who have so generously supported this research .

he was a christian guy during the weekends , but during the week he was a scientist .
i love those experiments , but i think that the most profound and life-changing experiment that i &apos;ve done is my most recent experiment , where i spent a year trying to follow all of the rules of the bible , &quot; the year of living biblically . &quot;
what crazy person would pop their head through a glass ceiling ?
and he took schwarzschild &apos;s idea to the prussian academy of sciences the next week .
but this is not a very efficient way to organize a regulation of wealth dynamics .
so let me show you the scene , and then i basically used the trick that was identified by sergei eisenstein , which is , if you have a camera that &apos;s moving with a moving object , what is not moving appears to be moving , and what is moving appears to be stopped , so what you &apos;re actually seeing now is the train is not moving at all , and what is actually moving is the floor .
in this country , if we win the election , we are going to make all government spending over 25,000 pounds transparent and available online , searchable for anyone to see .
sooner or later , sooner or later , the rule of history is that where power goes governance must follow .
so really the resolution is quite incredible .
it shows a cockroach moving over incredibly rough terrain without tipping over , and it &apos;s able to do this because its legs are a combination of rigid materials , which is what we traditionally use to make robots , and soft materials .
and there are hints of this .
now this is a real project that we worked on , literally , you would not believe how hard .
if you are a bit short in mathematical skills , don &apos;t worry .
so here &apos;s the thing .
this time , there &apos;s new treatments on the horizon .
tackling social and environmental problems at the same time with the same solution yields great cost savings , wealth generation and national security .
if she fails , we &apos;re all headed to the gallows ; if she passes , we can leave to vietnam .

the game costs about 80 million dollars to make , so basically it pays for itself in about a month .
so i time-stamp my life every few moments .
what makes our story especially important is that we have learned so much from a group of students who are typically not at the top of the academic ladder — students of color , students underrepresented in selected areas .

now , at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists or physical anthropologists in the audience , basically there &apos;s not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups .

but they didn &apos;t think that those numbers were related to them .
we here inside the room , i believe that we have the same concern , and the model that we created in brazil , we can transplant it here .
so we know flowers , we know fruits and vegetables , even some alfalfa in hay that the livestock for the meats that we eat , rely on pollinators , but you &apos;ve got male and female parts to a plant here , and basically pollinators are attracted to plants for their nectar , and in the process , a bee will visit some flowers and pick up some pollen , or that male kind of sperm counterpart , along the way , and then travel to different flowers , and eventually an apple , in this case , will be produced .
it &apos;s just a design of pitches and silence and time .
of course , we know that we &apos;re going to get old .
so again , financial engineering was helpful here .
they can create a much happier life for billions towards the future .
and i ask you that because we are increasingly in one .
well , i plan my route so that i &apos;m drifting with the winds and the currents while i &apos;m sleeping .
and then we poll the public and see where they score worst .

khaled saeed was killed in june 2010 .
there is no kind of center where everything happens .
why ? because if they aren &apos;t seeing that , it could be a red flag that their organization isn &apos;t as aligned as it could potentially be .
the self that lives in the long narrative arc and the self that experiences the moment become one .
and it also involved new choices for leaders .
simple menus put on a board , achieving , kind of , the sort of balance .
it takes a long time to learn how to do that , and they excavated the area and they found that this material culture , this way of doing it , these rocks , had passed down for at least 4,300 years through 225 chimpanzee generations .
i haven &apos;t told many people this , but in my head , i &apos;ve got thousands of secret worlds all going on all at the same time .
heike moses : hello everyone , i &apos;m heike , and i think it just kills the intrinsic motivation , so in the respect that children , if they would like to read , you just take this incentive away in just paying them , so it just changes behavior .
and to my mind , the scientific method — trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it doesn &apos;t — is one of the great accomplishments of humanity .
they &apos;re normally backroom or basement hardware service providers , but they need to be elevated to software strategists .
he said , &quot; &quot; do you have any questions ? &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; just one , doc .

well , for animals that are trying to avoid predators by staying in the darkness , light can still be very useful for the three basic things that animals have to do to survive : and that &apos;s find food , attract a mate and avoid being eaten .
they didn &apos;t want to go to a componentized system .
the second is for continued population , human population expansion .
gambia : we went to select a grandmother in gambia .
and ultimately , we become more human .
it was a little over 100 years ago that beijerinck discovered viruses .
let &apos;s consider for a while the option of monotasking .
so that means that they can try out new stuff without the embarrassment of having to pay if it didn &apos;t work , which for still quite a lot of bits of government , that &apos;s a serious issue .
there are lots of small streets .
it was just , &quot; &quot; because i say so .
and after about 15 or 20 minutes of this , she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said , &quot; &quot; come on , bryan . you and i are going to have a talk . &quot; &quot; and i remember this just like it happened yesterday .
what may be more reprehensible , if climate denial continues , is extermination of species .
and the very structure of an affair , the fact that you can never have your lover , keeps you wanting .
i &apos;m going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet , and not in the traditional sense , not just the gay closet .
and that fascinated me , to explore that territory .
and if it stops us from noticing and fixing those problems , well , then that &apos;s really bad .
rather than preceding the insurgency , the taliban followed the troop deployment , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , the troop deployment caused their return .
so these are the three arguments that i &apos;m going to give you quickly today .
10 years ago there , were very few countries that received sovereign ratings from the standard &amp; poors , moody &apos;s and fitch &apos;s .
it &apos;s odd . it has a battery .

her cancer continued to grow .

this one came from the sulfur dioxide from mount pinatubo in 1991 — cooled the earth by half a degree .
and i also have a little bit of a sort of smartass subtitle to this .
anyhow , i &apos;ll end that there , and thank you very much .
instead of , like , copper in 10 or 15 .
it works just purely on its form .

there are four on-board micro-controllers that , each time this ring rotates it , as it passes the rear of the display , it picks up a position signal .
and this actually represented kind of a sea change to me .
it adjusts continually . and we removed the air conditioning .
they love them .
but the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now , but that things are already inevitably changing , and what we need to do is to work creatively with that , based on asking the right questions .
the second point , would you really buy a car just based on the advice of the dealer ?
yet we have this idea , we humans , that the earth — all of it : the oceans , the skies — are so vast and so resilient it doesn &apos;t matter what we do to it .

i drew the logo for citibank on a napkin in the first meeting .
and most of the time , you &apos;ll find this insect lives in and around your home , so this — whatever we do has got to get to that insect .
when we started this out , we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem , which is why we chose the smallest genome .
now the first step , pretty easy .
in fact , it was beginning , and the 23 years since is a story of acknowledgment , apology and atonement .
what about martin luther king ?
he blew himself up , killing six .
i would say , we should call ourselves coctivors — ( laughter ) from coquere , to cook .
so , scientists knew all of that already , but it still doesn &apos;t fully explain how natalia found one so far north .
am : so , these are the sprint legs , and i can put my other ...
and they said you have to say bye to her , you have to do what you have to do .
it &apos;s pretty amazing , isn &apos;t it ?
i mean , who &apos;s carrying around an electron microscope in their pocket ?
we need to know what they say they want , not what they want in their heart of hearts , not what they think they can get , but what they say they want , because that is a strategically chosen position , and we can work backwards from that to draw inferences about important features of their decision-making .
suppose a terrorist wants to blow up a building , and he wants to do this again and again in the future .
your brain is locked in a vault of silence and darkness inside your skull .
thanks very much , and give me your card and sometime we &apos;ll talk . &quot; &quot; i didn &apos;t know ebay from that jar of water sitting on that piano , but i had the presence of mind to go back and talk to one of the techie kids at my center .

we invited 10 of the top mars scientists to the langley research center for two days .
and the simple fact is , if we are focused on ourselves , if we &apos;re preoccupied , as we so often are throughout the day , we don &apos;t really fully notice the other .
and finally , in part because of technology , the world is incredibly flux at the moment .
that &apos;s how linked data works .
and that &apos;s how i &apos;ve discovered that if i feel what is in the story — in one story — then i come the closest , i think , to knowing what compassion is , to feeling that compassion .
probably because when we admit we can do something about it , we &apos;ve got to do something about it .
they develop a persona , a signature style , much like fashion designers .
there is nothing — but a nuclear war of a kind we &apos;ve never seen — that can stop this &#91; growth &#93; from happening .

she won with 75 percent of the vote .
this is from stanford &apos;s computer science 101 class , and the students are supposed to color-correct that blurry red image .
and one day i was exploring this cul-de-sac hidden away a few streets away .
we have the individual power to go , &quot; &quot; this is what i want to do . &quot; &quot; and in a pointless universe , that , to me , is a wonderful thing .
it &apos;s serving the purpose of illumination , but at the same time , we are able to transmit this data .
and then a funny thing happened — they sold .
( laughter ) i promise .
we figured out how to put a vapor-compression distiller on this thing , with a counter-flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat , then using a little bit of the electricity control that process , and for 450 watts , which is a little more than half of its waste heat , it will make 10 gallons an hour of distilled water from anything that comes into it to cool it .
and how far down into it you figure we &apos;ll have to scroll to get to the golden ticket ?
i never saw his face .
i was the youngest by at least a decade , but somehow the poets at the bowery poetry club didn &apos;t seem bothered by the 14-year-old wandering about .
this allows you to drag and drop these blocks of semantic code and create any behavior for this robot you want .
remember , i was young then .
what in the laboratory that i see out there , the laboratories of democracy , what has happened ?
the real issue in cellular biology is we are never going to understand everything , because it &apos;s a multidimensional problem put there by evolution .
that &apos;s why we are so scared about flu , isn &apos;t it ?
my inspiration comes from problems in my daily life .
i think it &apos;s time for the subject to go public .
i needed to go deeper .
and in 2011 , he was running a big campaign to address everyday corruption in india , a topic that indian elites love to ignore .
where does it lie on that chart ?
so , when i started this , i didn &apos;t have an overall plan for the machine , but i did have a sense of the gesture , and a sense of the shape and how it would occupy space .
and it &apos;s something i &apos;m very excited to be a part of .
peace piberesima : we &apos;re doing films for the masses .
as an evolutionary biologist , i &apos;d say this : our brains have evolved to help us survive within the orders of magnitude , of size and speed which our bodies operate at .
we get far more questions right on i.q. tests than each succeeding generation back to the time that they were invented .
the goal was to destroy secretly the self-confidence of people , for example by damaging their reputation , by organizing failures in their work , and by destroying their personal relationships .
and then in moments of high adrenaline , like when something exciting was happening , i would up that photographic frequency to as many as 37 photographs in five minutes .
and it &apos;s a brand new leadership challenge .
one of the things i did not stress in that introduction was that , systematically , the pace of life decreases as you get bigger .
and i was calling about how to make ajiaco . it &apos;s a cuban meal .
when we &apos;re turning , we have the feeling of surfing , and the way it &apos;s going up-wind , it &apos;s very efficient .
i started to prospect under the benches of bakeries and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points .

he got married . he had a son called jeremiah .
but there &apos;s a far worse danger confronting us .
i was hooked . i was hooked . ( laughter ) cold water was constantly on my mind , and from that point on , my career focused on these types of harsh and unforgiving environments , and it took me to places like russia , norway , alaska , iceland , chile , the faroe islands , and a lot of places in between .
so our cost for this was less than 10,000 dollars , all right .
income per person . i can put that here .
now these provisional structures have , in some cases , remained standing for the better part of a human lifetime .
so basically , you have a group of people who are excited by the idea .
i &apos;m not taking sides .
let me give you an example .
so , naturally , they chased him out of town .
here &apos;s the united states — considerably richer than new zealand , but with a lower level of social progress .

( laughter ) yesterday , the automotive guys gave us some new insights .
so if you go back about two and a half billion years , the earth was this big , sterile hunk of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around on it .
and here , here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the tanzanian giraffe .
like , hats off to south africa and turkey and israel and somalia and japan and gambia .
what if my roommate knew about the female lawyer who recently went to court in nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband &apos;s consent before renewing their passports ?
so that &apos;s idea one : recognize interdependence .

we actually need to bring all of our intelligence to becoming stupid again — clueless &#91; before &#93; the immensity of the unknown .
but the modality of attention , or what is happening today , what &apos;s happening tomorrow .
then , at the top , there is a before and an after image of the landing .
so what can we do about that ? what can we say ?
on the other hand , we don &apos;t know how to accommodate it into our scientific view of the world .
wipe it up , throw it away .
pretty clever , right ?
basically they went to the ballot boxes to tell that they have nobody to vote for .
special olympics is transforming their lives off the field .
when the room smelled gross , what we saw was that individuals actually reported more negative attitudes toward gay men .
and i &apos;m not even sure we know what technology is .
they were identical except for one thing .
we parse it out on an as-needed basis , sometimes for very good reasons , other times just because we don &apos;t understand the gaps in our lives .
i had them keep track of their time for a week so i could add up how much they worked and slept , and i interviewed them about their strategies , for my book .
i would not let an adult drive my robot .
what if you had no access to public libraries ?
one , two , three and four .
we know that the brain is capable of extraordinary change , and the best way to achieve that , even in adults , is to change and modulate our environment .
so thank you .
i &apos;m here to talk about very real killer robots , autonomous combat drones .
it &apos;s 350 people on the committee for oklahoma city , which is why we thought of this as a sort of ad-hoc , spontaneous solution that expanded on union square and the places that were ad-hoc memorials in the city already .
there &apos;s an anteroom with photographs of children who perished and then you come into a large space .
and basically , it &apos;s a system made of two components — a sensing and an actuating component .
ma : i think we &apos;re slowly changing , but obviously there are whole pockets in countries where nothing is different .
foremost among them is the exorbitant cost of sending money home .
for example , true story : just a few weeks ago , this cab driver , upon finding out that a friend and i were in town for a game developers &apos; conference , turned around and said — and i quote — &quot; &quot; i hate games . waste of life .
think about this for a second .
as long as these devices are there , or there is suspicion of landmines , you can &apos;t really enter into the land .
it has a tail . and just when you think you &apos;ve figured out nature , this kind of thing happens .
( laughter ) my company , called freelance programmers , and that &apos;s precisely what it was , couldn &apos;t have started smaller : on the dining room table , and financed by the equivalent of 100 dollars in today &apos;s terms , and financed by my labor and by borrowing against the house .
i &apos;m going to talk to you today about hopefully converting fear into hope .
so this is a local person potentially deciding whether to enter the babysitting market .
be aware of these people who &#91; are &#93; coming to you in order to ruin your great civilization . &quot; &quot; fortunately , people right now cannot be deceived .
we know now that that is not the case because of the greenhouse gases that coal produces .
and yet the politicization of never again , the operationalization of never again , had never occurred in the 20th century .
we &apos;re all mammals here , we all have a lot of neural and hormonal programming that makes us really bond with others , care for others , feel compassion for others , especially the weak and vulnerable .
dh : i think so , that &apos;s right .
and we make the machine meet them half way .
and because working in a store was so hard , i liked going to school ; it was like heaven .
and they &apos;re totally emotionally excited about the fact that they walk around thinking of themselves as a creative person .
but also it &apos;s part of being any monthly magazine — you live in the future . and we have a long lead-time .
( laughter ) i &apos;m teasing you , sweetheart . no , i &apos;m comfortable with any question .
everything we blog , everything we tweet , and everything we click is a public act of making media .
not just with their puppy , but with the rest of the family at class .
if you read a book , pull things up .
before most kids are 12 , they &apos;ll have been to disney world more times than they &apos;ve been in a canoe or camping under a starry sky .
governments executed people for frivolous reasons , like stealing a cabbage or criticizing the royal garden .
so the five of us , two americans , two italians and a spaniard , we — ( laughter ) you know , it &apos;s a worldwide project . ( laughter ) so we came together in this design institute called the interaction design institute ivrea , which was teaching interaction design , this idea that you can take design from the simple shape of an object and you can move it forward to design the way you interact with things .
ab : 987 squared is 974,169 .
and it was then that i thought back to my jittery hands .
i have worked with more than 500 companies .
can i tell you how un-canadian that is ?
so what do you do with a dead mall , dead office park ?
do we really believe that god is the kind of male boss that we &apos;ve been presenting in our worship and in our liturgies over all these years ?
and we have a lot of it sitting around , because this is a big problem .
azuri , hi , how are you doing ?
here &apos;s an ad in the new york times somebody did for a play called &quot; &quot; mind games . &quot; &quot; then &quot; &quot; chicago &quot; &quot; came out , used similar graphics , and the public theater &apos;s identity was just totally eaten and taken away , which meant i had to change it .
this change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in africa , and they allowed us to start to expand around the world .
here , this is a protocell , and it &apos;s vigorously shedding this skin .
but i really believe that a fully operating , rich society needs these seeds coming from all directions and all disciplines in order to keep the gears of inspiration and imagination flowing and cycling and growing .
it has curves in two directions , one curve upward and opposite transverse curve down the other , so any kind of perturbation spreads the forces over the surface of this type of shape .
and it &apos;s apparently okay to marry a boy from georgia , but not to have hair from texas .
and the umbrella campaign was &quot; &quot; thank god it &apos;s monday . &quot; &quot; so , we tried to take this — what was perceived as a negative : their over-competitiveness , their , you know , long working hours — and turn it into a positive and not run from it .
if they have a hip fracture we go with them and we study their entire discharge experience .
so i couldn &apos;t handle it .
still exists back home .
&quot; &quot; it is a pity , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; that the police in this country are not tough enough on bad drivers . &quot; &quot; i was baffled .
or should they not ?
80 percent of africans still rely on traditional medicine .
if you can use jelly to make a robot — now , we eat jelly , right ?
so in the morning , in between six and seven in the morning , the body is then transported inside of the body bag to our center and is being scanned through one of the ct scanners .
the participants at improv everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other new yorkers , they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way .
and i thought like , &quot; &quot; wow . i &apos;m like , living in a science fiction movie .
and what we &apos;re seeing is , can we expand the human umvelt so that he comes to have , after several weeks , a direct perceptual experience of the economic movements of the planet .
einstein once said , &quot; &quot; logic will get you from a to b.
and i did one that was about 35 feet long .
that &apos;s where i live , and it &apos;s my university as well .
in the lab , we get people to come to the lab , sit in front of a computer screen , and we give them little tasks that i &apos;m going to get you to do again .
so you can see that the fibers wrap in helices , and those fibers can reorient as the skeleton moves , which means the skeleton &apos;s flexible .
they are my heroes and my father is my hero , who understood democracy and guided me through it .
these vibrios , these bacteria , can actually infect people .
think of the expense , the human cost of that .
we should be angry , because this is wrong , and it &apos;s rude , and it should not be done .
not because it &apos;s a job , not because it &apos;s a career , but because it &apos;s a calling .
you can stay with me for 20 years , go tomorrow .
we &apos;re talking about a pick , pack and ship setting here .
noise becomes music .
a country like america has four times the amount of food that it needs .
and as you know , everybody loves that , too .
as weeks of deprivation stretched into months , some resorted to eating tulip bulbs .
or does somebody want to run a marathon , or does somebody want to ballroom dance ?
so what i &apos;m going to do is , every now and again , i will make this gesture , and in a moment of powerpoint democracy , you can imagine what you &apos;d like to see .
well , we used to use trampettes . in the old days , that &apos;s all they had .
we &apos;re going to then apply one of those stains to it , and we scan it .
you could regain this time .
the mind , our most valuable and precious resource , through which we experience every single moment of our life .
and that &apos;s more or less the story of the coral reefs of the caribbean , and increasingly , tragically , the coral reefs worldwide .
( laughter ) you know , that &apos;s what you call a lead . ( laughter )
and these are sometimes unsafe places to send our sickest patients , especially in an era of superbugs and hospital-acquired infections .
how are we going to find these planets ?
think about it with the corexit hitting the membranes , and it will clog up the gills , and then these animals are going to be getting something like what you call chemical pneumonia , trying to aspirate the compounds .
granted , we &apos;re not sending humans up at the moment , well at least with our own launch vehicles , but nasa is far from dead , and one of the reasons why we write a program like this is so that people realize that there &apos;s so many other things that we &apos;re doing .
this is still not really ideal for research , though , because it &apos;s not entirely clear where all of these passwords came from , or exactly what policies were in effect when people created these passwords .
get yourself a fat reward . life &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; i can &apos;t do it .
i &apos;m a contemporary artist and i show in art galleries and museums .
and portland is not alone here .
i know many well-intentioned non-muslims who &apos;ve begun reading the koran , but given up , disconcerted by its &quot; &quot; otherness . &quot; &quot; the historian thomas carlyle considered muhammad one of the world &apos;s greatest heroes , yet even he called the koran &quot; &quot; as toilsome reading as i ever undertook , a wearisome , confused jumble . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) part of the problem , i think , is that we imagine that the koran can be read as we usually read a book — as though we can curl up with it on a rainy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn within reach , as though god — and the koran is entirely in the voice of god speaking to muhammad —
so essentially , the shape of the building that you &apos;re born into is the shape of the structure which carries you to your ancestral resting place .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s , since it was invented a year or two ago , has given me untold happiness .
we did not prioritize right .
we call it &quot; &quot; liquid lead dancing . &quot; &quot; jf : let &apos;s try this with a latin dance , salsa .
we want to strike a balance where they have the freedom to do anything but not a lot of money showered on them so they could go out and do nothing .
people here get very confused about what a punishment is .
we need women to work . we need working women to have babies .
so what we find is that there is this great deal of wasted crisis information because there is just too much information for us to actually do anything with right now .
what does this all mean ?
it is this fear that &apos;s feeding the diet industry , which is keeping so many of us from making peace with our own bodies , for waiting to be the after-photo before we truly start to live our lives .
how cheap ?
we got dirty , and we loved it .
so that &apos;s what i do . i study color a lot .
this is a book written by a consummate player by the name of kevin carroll .
after finishing his bedtime rituals , he looked at me and he asked a question : &quot; mommy , are we bad people ? &quot;
and these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid .
and we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places .
and they look like this . they &apos;re basically very simple arrangements .
we are always doing things we like in our life .
by definition the outcome is outside of our control , and if that &apos;s where we spend all of our emotional energy , we are going to get drained as we do .
and i thought , you know , what were they thinking ?
unconsciously , a concert will be connected to a brush and a roulette game will be connected to a hat .
and so we know that , for example , openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success , but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and , occasionally , odd .
dh : please stand up , richard . ( whip cracks ) oh , sorry . ( laughter ) dh : now richard , please ... ( whip cracks ) bf : ok , sorry .
this was a work made by mike tyka in our group , which he calls &quot; &quot; animal parade . &quot; &quot; it reminds me a little bit of william kentridge &apos;s artworks , in which he makes sketches , rubs them out , makes sketches , rubs them out , and creates a movie this way .
and i put 100 million cells in his cisterna magna , in his lumbar cord , and filled out the irbs and did all this work , and i never really knew .
sk : so that &apos;s the final element in it that just makes it that much more ridiculous , that there is a flag design within the milwaukee flag .
but maybe they have another faculty , something else that would seem equally irrational to us , but they actually tap into some great possible value there .
there are actually a wave of startups like connect.me and legit and trustcloud that are figuring out how you can aggregate , monitor and use your online reputation .
♫ just a little rain , just a little rain , just a little rain ♫ ♫ i want what i can &apos;t have , need what i can &apos;t want ♫ ♫ have what i don &apos;t have , what i want ♫ ♫ what i can &apos;t have , need what i can &apos;t want ♫ ♫ have but i don &apos;t have ♫ ♫ my mind won &apos;t stop , and my heart says go ♫ ♫ nobody knows how to hold me ♫ ♫ my mind won &apos;t stop , and my heart says , ♫ ♫ &quot; &quot; good things come to those who wait &quot; &quot; ♫ ♫ and i can &apos;t stand in ... ♫
maybe even find a tumor , in some cases .
a hundred companies , we can work with .
so we &apos;re seeing there &apos;s a real extension of middle age .
so i actually went to school in belfast , which was where all the action happened .
in the andes , this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city .
( laughter ) i later had a child , after getting married , and i was living essentially the egyptian-american dream .
i &apos;m going to tell you five facts about myself .
thank you .
there is the beijing olympic games coming in august 2008 , and it &apos;s very clear that the chinese government is controlling the economy and doing what it takes to also avoid any wave and control the stock market . &quot; &quot; three weeks after my presentation , the markets lost 20 percent and went through a phase of volatility , upheaval , and a total market loss of 70 percent until the end of the year .
and they &apos;re big mountains , thousands of feet tall , some of which are tens of thousands of feet and bust through the surface , creating islands like hawaii .
well , the question of origins , as with so many other questions in biology , seems to have been answered by darwin over a century ago .
i learned so much about myself .
true aliens , stocks that arrived from outer space .
you see india , you see brazil .
so as you can guess , my mother tongue is french .
which kind of delivered the answer , which i couldn &apos;t really answer , which is , &quot; &quot; what do i do with my life ? &quot; &quot; i love diplomacy — i have no career — i expected my entire life to be a diplomat , to be serving my country .
and these women would get together and just talk .
my wife , yvonne , and i , we have four kids , three grown ones and a 15-year-old .
after 12 days of storm i get to row for four hours without a flagging wind .
sophal ear : so , notwithstanding the 1970s narration , on april 17th 1975 we lived in phnom penh .
everything i was looking at seemed like it was going to kill me , but i couldn &apos;t explain why .
one more time .
but it didn &apos;t lead to the exceptional results that they were hoping for .
europe of and by the people , a europe , an experiment in deepening and widening democracy beyond borders .
and we calculated several scenarios , and the picture always looked like this .
it &apos;s a place where families can stay together to enjoy quality time with their children , many of whom are there for respite stays , some with repeated visits over a span of many years .
it can happen that these two protons can hop over .
we tend to think of emotions as just feelings .
and when it is full , it is blocked and it can go to the next .
after six days , thomas died in ross &apos;s arms surrounded by our family .
they clung to certainty in the belief that doubt would undermine them .
and i &apos;m going to show a video of the older version of it , which is just a minute long . okay .
as a matter of fact , i think a lot of my design ideas come from mistakes and tricks of the eye .
she did so much . she was a playwright .
it &apos;s one part of the form and content .
( laughter ) and with this rationale , i look at these days and i think , i &apos;m not retired . i don &apos;t feel retired at all .
now language &apos;s subversive power has been recognized throughout the ages in censorship , in books you can &apos;t read , phrases you can &apos;t use and words you can &apos;t say .
how many here would say that casey martin does have a right to use a golf cart ?
then we thought that the earth is the unmoving center of reality because it looks that way .
it &apos;s a little bit like the invasion of the body snatchers .
in this hypothetical circumstance , this civilization would have exhausted the energy supply of their home planet , so where could they get more energy ?
and so i began to sort of mess with the computer at the time .
eve , first woman .
but the question is , does this matter to babies in how they treat the puppets ? and it matters a lot .
in 2012 , we entered the competition for the angelini innovation center , and the aim was to build the right environment for knowledge creation .
they &apos;ve found small objects such as these .
and that &apos;s not the only leopards that were being killed through that period .
and then , after they get that care — like the mouse , like the skier , like the 65-year-old woman — they &apos;ll wake up .
so we &apos;re really entering the era of wearable robotics actually .
there &apos;s lots of businesses that would like to locate in the americas , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there &apos;s lots of people who &apos;d like to go there .
and the same is true for the troops .
and one of the things i really like about open source is it really allows different people to work together .
these big issues that will change the world , change national security , change economics , create hope , create threats , can only be resolved when you bring together groups of people who understand science and technology back together with government .
so you have what &apos;s called the xenon pit , and so some of these fission products love neutrons .
around that time i met an extraordinary human being , peter thum , who inspired me with his actions .
i was afraid that people would see me for who i really was , that i wasn &apos;t the perfect , popular kid in high school everyone thought i was , that beneath my smile , there was struggle , and beneath my light , there was dark , and beneath my big personality just hid even bigger pain .
&#91; the civil war in syria may seem far away &#93; &#91; until you experience it yourself . &#93; ( girl singing ) ( explosion ) &#91; project syria &#93; &#91; a virtual reality experience &#93; np : we were then invited to take the piece to the victoria and albert museum in london .
the time is now for us to show them fairness , and we can do that , you and i , by starting where we work , in the businesses that we operate in .
honeybee robotics designed the mars driller , and it was really very much fun to work with them .
we decided to do something a little bit different and transform flavors that were very familiar — so in this case , we have carrot cake .
it becomes more and more and more expensive to dig them out .
what i found incredibly astonishing and so motivational was that these families were so motivated to support their children .
( laughter ) ( applause ) there is obviously einstein , niels bohr , de fermat &apos;s last theorem , and i &apos;m not sure whether that &apos;s james coburn or richard harris . ( laughter )
( laughter ) ilkka hanski was an ecologist in finland , and he did this experiment himself .
in a survey , 74 percent of women said that miscarriage , they felt , was partly their fault , which is awful .
in fact , this is the score for dan &apos;s piece , completely composed by dan in hyperscore .
and my first car was a 1975 electric-green mustang .
this is called &quot; &quot; i &apos;m an emotional creature . &quot; &quot; and it happened because i met a girl in watts , l.a.
i question the entire premise of this piece , but i &apos;m always interested in hearing what they &apos;ve come up with before they call me .
( applause ) chris anderson : so , ashraf , until recently , you were the finance minister of afghanistan , a country right at the middle of much of the world &apos;s agenda .
a caterpillar &apos;s mouth .
today , their share has more than doubled to above 20 percent .
and i put a piece of tape around it , as you see there , and realized you could sit on it , and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on .
he ruled the country with an iron fist , and anyone who dared question his authority was arrested , tortured , jailed or even killed .
all we are left with is the skeleton , if you will , of the liver , all made up of collagen , a material that &apos;s in our bodies , that will not reject .
you can actually see the point when i know what i &apos;m doing , and a lot of light and dark comes into it .
holy cow ! that &apos;s just amazing .
and sooner or later , we &apos;re going to have to accept the fact that health care innovation can &apos;t always come at a much higher price .
but we can make it possible for most .
so these simple projections of the goldman sachs type are not telling us what we need to know about power transition .
in the context of this broad range of digital relations , safely seeking strangeness might very well be a new basis for that innovation .
who loves the wedding almost as much as the bride ?
and the way to it , for me , was through artistic means .
and she also got books for herself .
the first thing i learned that day was that i never ever wanted to work that hard again .
how are they connected , and what does that global conversation look like ?
these beautiful illustrations are then shut back into the pages of a medical textbook , or an app , referenced only when needed .
so one of these works is the &quot; &quot; spelling spider . &quot; &quot; so the spelling spider is a cousin of the spelling bee .
i &apos;m going to give you some building blocks and they &apos;re nonrectilinear cactus building blocks , so it &apos;s totally legit . &quot; &quot; but he doesn &apos;t really know what to do with these .
why are we conscious ?
okay , now i promised you to tell you some of the outrageous things said about consciousness .
as much as we know , there is so much more that we don &apos;t know , and so i invite all of you to be able to help us think about how to do this better , to use as a community our collective wisdom to be able to make a difference , and in particular , for the individuals in families with autism , i invite you to join the interactive autism network , to be part of the solution to this , because it &apos;s going to take really a lot of us to think about what &apos;s important , what &apos;s going to be a meaningful difference .
so i thought , why don &apos;t we get into that business ?
or perhaps an ordinary person like you or me ?
and these hands were influenced by this man , mr. inami naomi .
they need an inclusive process where the real fabric of this very complicated society can deal with their issues .
some of my hypotheses are that when you first think about skeletal muscle , there &apos;s a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle .
( applause ) thank you .
unaids tell us that the hiv rate in zambia is 20 percent , and mortality estimates suggest it &apos;s only about 5 percent .
i had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end .
it &apos;s also very biologically active , as anyone with hay fever will understand .
now this is an extremely complicated subject , in part because the things that we call beautiful are so different .
and what you don &apos;t see in this picture is that somewhere between these riders there , there &apos;s a teenager sitting on a rock , saying , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m not moving from here . forget it .
so you &apos;d just see her feet .
or are there deeper structural factors that have led us to where we are today ?
don &apos;t want it to leave me behind . &quot; &quot; and from all around as people started singing and answering back , he sang : &quot; &quot; good news , good news : chariot &apos;s coming .
in a small country that could be my country , but could be also your country , they took a decision — it is a real case story — that all of the governmental decisions , discussions of the council of ministers , were going to be published on the internet 24 hours after the council discussions took place .
having spent 18 years as a child of the state in children &apos;s homes and foster care , you could say that i &apos;m an expert on the subject , and in being an expert , i want to let you know that being an expert does in no way make you right in light of the truth .
when they kept this under wraps , but soon others got to know .
the other week , i went on one of these sites , appropriately called swaptree , and there were over 59,300 items that i could instantly swap for my copy of &quot; &quot; 24 . &quot; &quot; lo and behold , there in reseda , ca was rondoron who wanted swap his or her &quot; like new &quot; copy of &quot; sex and the city &quot; for my copy of &quot; &quot; 24 . &quot; &quot; so in other words , what &apos;s happening here is that swaptree solves my carrying company &apos;s sugar rush problem , a problem the economists call &quot; &quot; the coincidence of wants , &quot; &quot; in approximately 60 seconds .
i &apos;ve had a grenade thrown at my office .
how are we going to do these attacks ?
so at the end of it , we concluded that groups of children can learn to use computers and the internet on their own , irrespective of who or where they were .
because our dental anatomy is actually made , not for tearing down raw meat from bones or chewing fibrous leaves for hours .
so what &apos;s going on ?
and some of these patients played a video game where they drive around a small town .
so , if you ’ re designing an interaction between two people — such as , i don ’ t know — ordering food at a fast food joint or something , you need to be able to imagine how that experience might feel over a period of time .
it was astonishing . they were also producing mangroves in a plantation .
we don &apos;t live to eat and make money .
the great hall at the met is one of the great portals of the world , awe-inspiring , like a medieval cathedral .
six hours later , up goes the temperature .
so now it &apos;s going from fish and sharks into reptiles , which , again , this is only one month old , but it shows us that we know almost nothing about this hawksbill turtle &apos;s vision .
and fish are much more interesting than corals , because they have really advanced vision , and some of the fish even have , the way that i was photographing it , they have lenses in their eyes that would magnify the fluorescence .
they put it on fire . it was boiling hot , getting ready to give to the kids .
that &apos;s 127 rides per second , showing that this is a cross-cultural phenomenon .
and i studied very much in sweden .
the phones just aren &apos;t ringing about the people . &quot; &quot; and the reason i give you this moment is there &apos;s a deep truth in it .
to take the example of migration , we know that immigration is a net positive for the economy as a whole under almost all circumstances .
your brain does a lot of its work behind the scenes , and that is a good thing , because your conscious mind — how do we put this politely ? — it &apos;s easily distracted .
so for the partner who had the affair , for nick , one thing is to end the affair , but the other is the essential , important act of expressing guilt and remorse for hurting his wife .
now it should be clear by now that this book is in bad condition .
it &apos;s the kind of original movement for any puppet for us onstage .
they &apos;re closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason , and i believe we shouldn &apos;t tolerate that either .
when we think about why we hear , we don &apos;t often think about the ability to hear an alarm or a siren , although clearly that &apos;s an important thing .
it &apos;s about how do you create a new product or develop a new product or manufacture a new product , but not a new product itself ?
now , i became a psychologist to help mitigate human suffering , and for the past 10 years , my target has been the suffering caused by ptsd , as experienced by veterans like carlos .
first of all , if you can , don &apos;t fight the patent , fight the infringement .
zero became a person and not just a character in a play .
now , in 2010 , the australian national university did an experiment where they sent out 4,000 identical applications to entry level jobs , essentially .
so she now works full-time on this for very little pay .
thank you .
second is salicornia bigelovii . very difficult to get around the world .
&quot; drugs are fun in the beginning but become a drag later on . &quot;
and when someone accesses your medical record , a research doctor , they could see , you could see which doctor accessed it and why , and you could maybe learn about what conditions you have .
i read a dictionary . i got into college .
when food was scarce , our ancestors &apos; survival depended on conserving energy , and regaining the weight when food was available would have protected them against the next shortage .
and if we do that , we &apos;re going to stop seeing cities as big , metropolitan , unproductive blobs , like this .
ca : five years ago you had an idea . what was that ?
sebastian : draw thy sword .
i am a neuroscientist with a mixed background in physics and medicine .
we can recover sounds from other objects , like plants .
you must be tolerant .
there was another unusual boat out there at the same time , doing as i was doing , bringing awareness to the north pacific garbage patch , that area in the north pacific about twice the size of texas , with an estimated 3.5 million tons of trash in it , circulating at the center of that north pacific gyre .
so she goes from oxford , she &apos;s sent to the north of england to a mother and baby home , and appointed a social worker .
we all want to share our stories , whether it is the trick we saw at the party , the bad day at the office or the beautiful sunset we saw on vacation .
and then she gets in her root-beer colored 1994 cadillac seville , and tears down the san bernardino freeway , where she still volunteers for seven different organizations .
and we did not know that u.s. intelligence agencies go to extremes such as infiltrating standardization bodies to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose .
so how do we test that ? well , that &apos;s easy .

these families had been through what we had been watching on the tv .
my neck was so stiff i couldn &apos;t touch my chin to my chest , and the slightest sound — the rustling of the sheets , my husband walking barefoot in the next room — could cause excruciating pain .
and we set ourselves a goal of turning the continent green .
and my claim is that mathematics has to do with patterns .
i think that &apos;s part of what the complexity of architecture is .
what do they tell us ?
and then it got stranger .
and japan is trying to move up there .
these places , these origins , represent governance gaps .
but as i said earlier , this kind of logic applies across the board for infectious diseases , and it ought to .
horses &apos; hearing is very important .
you stop by a wall , and start painting on that wall .
we had relay races with condoms , we had children &apos;s condom-blowing championship .
so we at the hebrew university , about 10 years ago , decided to focus on probably the most important biomaterial for humans , which is collagen .
the ripples of the personal dna revolution may be hard to predict , but one thing is certain : revolutions don &apos;t go backwards , and dna technology is already spreading faster than our imagination .
i think it would be interesting to see what everyone did with a project like this .
it &apos;s a dream . and it became a dream also .
this is data from the congressional budget office showing its most realistic forecast of what would happen if current situations and expectations and trends are extended .
sunlight is the best disinfectant .
it motivates me to make sure that i stay on the right path .
i &apos;m showing here venus , earth and mars — three planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size , but only one of which is really a good place to live .
i think it &apos;s extremely important that we have sustainable transport and sustainable energy production .
now , i should pause and say , what do i mean by puzzle ?
as he said , i was co-inventor of the furby .
well it allowed you to do that .
this is morocco last year in the atlas mountains , training in preparation for some high altitude jumps .
primates emerge from jungles , as tarsiers first , becoming lemurs not much later .
and those are frozen solid , and they &apos;re shipped to seattle .
( applause ) from malta , madagascar , thailand , vietnam , jordan , egypt , israel , as far north as alaska and as far south as new zealand .
what &apos;s ended up happening over the past few decades is the kind of coverage that you had as a head of state or as a great celebrity is now being applied to you every day by all these people who are tweeting , blogging , following you , watching your credit scores and what you do to yourself .
sand , water , all the equipment we don &apos;t need anymore .
now my husband , chris , and i love this show .
that is , you have to decide what that other person expects of you .
thank you .
finally , there &apos;s one of evening primrose that bjorn rorslett from norway sent me — fantastic hidden pattern .
but i wasn &apos;t there for nine months at a time like the filipino seafarers , who , when i asked them to describe their job to me , called it &quot; &quot; dollar for homesickness . &quot; &quot; they had good salaries , but theirs is still an isolating and difficult life in a dangerous and often difficult element .
what it &apos;s all about is the selective representations of things that are important to the brain .
the animal could be a cow , lamb , or even something more exotic .
put that another way — of all of them who test positive — so here they are , the individuals involved — less than one in 100 actually have the disease .
and then there &apos;s this one : &quot; if there &apos;s grass on the field , play ball . &quot;
he &apos;s one of more than 175 so-called terrorists , for whom the fbi has created hollywood endings .
i think this film is one of the hardest watches of modern times , &quot; &quot; the road . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a beautiful piece of filmmaking , but everything is desolate , everything is dead .
so over the 200 years of whaling , when we were busy killing and removing these carcasses from the oceans , we likely altered the rate and geographic distribution of these whale falls that would descend into deep oceans , and as a result , probably led to a number of extinctions of species that were most specialized and dependent on these carcasses for their survival .
and i &apos;m not saying there was no pair-bonding going on .
president obama understands that .
women are especially vulnerable to recruitment malpractices .
but the problem with relying on rules and incentives is that they demoralize professional activity , and they demoralize professional activity in two senses .
my mental illness — well , i &apos;m not even going to talk about my mental illness .
whether it be a mother , a daughter , a sister , a friend or a grandmother .
this pig at 10 : 06 was having a heart attack .
there are three featured in the film .
information visibility drives efficiency .
and in this , you &apos;d have like a — something that looks like a cloud , and it is a cloud at the same time .
i photographed him at the scene of the crime at the snake river in idaho .
so here &apos;s the thing . it sounds like a simple question .
but it &apos;s the best music making , like this .
or the sensual feeling .
then i thought , &quot; &quot; wait a minute , what am i doing ? &quot; &quot; a book is not only a neat way of collecting and storing information , it &apos;s a series of layers .
&quot; &quot; a maimed monument and a maimed mall for a maimed collection . &quot; &quot; almost four decades later , how will this building expand for a new progressive program ?
so that was the low-fear group .
but that would sort of be jumping to the middle of the story , and i &apos;m not going to show you that polished video .
we can see everything on wikipedia .
first , i &apos;m going to fly you over the rings .
and they all seemed to be ok .
so if you give just to one side or the other , you &apos;ll have tension or friction .
some of the organisms see all of the reality , others see just part of the reality , and some see none of the reality , only fitness .
calvin washington was convicted of capital murder .
but actually , the most exciting part of this new manufacturing revolution goes much beyond productivity .
we &apos;re going to do it non-invasively using mri .
but she ate it .
and one of those i &apos;d like to share with you today .
we have the tendency for people to go for 50 dollars now over waiting a month , but not if that decision is far in the future .
( laughter ) i recommend you all do this .
both parties know exactly what the speaker means , and the speaker knows the listener knows that the speaker knows that the listener knows , etc . , etc .

imagine you &apos;re learning to play tennis and you want to decide where the ball is going to bounce as it comes over the net towards you .
but i &apos;d heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time , so how did the good and bad go together ?
the dark side of the web is allergic to the light .
i mixed them up , heated them , cooled them down , and i got 50 billion little smiley faces floating around in a single drop of water .
and then i was also surprised by the city &apos;s propensity for kindness and care as opposed to indifference or worse .
now we may think that &apos;s good or bad , but in either case it &apos;s real .
ah , avaricious heaven !
i think this one here , there &apos;s a pop song that really describes philippe starck for me , you know , this is like you know , this is like puppy love , you know , this is cool right ?
i can &apos;t tell , nor can any of our algorithms , but in the case of a driver assistance system , that means it can &apos;t take action , because again , if it presses the brakes unexpectedly , that &apos;s completely unacceptable .
in the past , before air conditioning , we had thick walls .
and overlying this is the skin drape , which is a hugely complex three-dimensional structure — taking right-angled bends here and there , having thin areas like the eyelids , thick areas like the cheek , different colors .
the phantasmagoria , the actual experience that we try to understand and organize through narrative , varies from place to place .
thank you .

this is my collaborator ryota kanai .
my name is rashid , and i never been at ted before , you know what i &apos;m saying .
not only that , but some really bad scientists want to do some experiments on him , and they &apos;re looking for him .
many of you don &apos;t think of this yet , but the ocean will be in your pocket .
and i was actually rowing for my school here until this fateful day , and i flipped over right in front of the entire school .
and i sought out the most remote places .
moreover , once we can do that , we can actually activate specific neurons or we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those neurons .
and i feel like i &apos;m actually depriving them of information by telling them this , at which point i usually panic and spit out the first thing that comes to my mind , which is , i have no idea what i &apos;m doing .
meds don &apos;t equal medical care .
my job is to actually make sure that we make progress on all of these disorders .
exploring with them the forest canopy has been one of the most lovely things of my existence on earth .
i normally teach courses on how to rebuild states after war .
and even so , you can still see the shadows of these great beasts in our current ecosystems .
thank you .
they want to hunker down , they want to look to the future .
but that &apos;s changed .
and the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
slightly embarrassing admission : even when i was a kid , i used to have these little spy books , and i would , like , see what everybody was doing in my neighborhood and log it down .
but the challenge is , again , they don &apos;t get much value , because they can &apos;t afford anything more than the scooter .
designs were refined and developed with 150 older people and their families before the service was launched earlier this year .
but just the technological savings in heavy trucks can get to two-thirds .
there was no one there to look at treatment approaches .
do you remember , 20 years ago , no one had ever heard of west nile fever ?
we landed with 40 kilos .
what am i doing with the architecture ?
and how much will these samples be worth ?
this is actually a picture of the printing mechanism for another machine of his , called the difference engine no. 2 , which he never built , but which the science museum did build in the &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s .
we &apos;ve been around as homo sapiens — that &apos;s a rather generous definition , sapiens — for perhaps a quarter of a million years , a quarter of a million .
it happens . right ?
you and i — even you in the back — we live in three dimensions of space .
which is also increased when we &apos;re with our women friends .
i was active in the youth ministry .
right now , profounder &apos;s right at the very beginning , and it &apos;s very palpable ; it &apos;s very clear to me , that it &apos;s just a vessel , it &apos;s just a tool .
there is lots of showing off .
but finding me busy , she fled , with the dawn .
well , in this , there &apos;s personalization all the way .
but instead of having constant accidental or mindless interruptions , we &apos;re now only creating conscious interruptions , so we &apos;re doing two things here .
( music ) but , what if ...
for multiple defenders , we can look at how the player &apos;s moving and predict the shot type .
well , if you take the informational , panpsychist view , she certainly has complicated information processing and integration , so the answer is very likely yes , she is conscious .
and we had this mantra : &quot; human . kind . be both . &quot;
a great way to start , i think , with my view of simplicity is to take a look at ted . here you are , understanding why we &apos;re here , what &apos;s going on with no difficulty at all .
that &apos;s because it &apos;s cheaper .
unfortunately , this is often lacking or inefficient in a lot of developing countries .
and i was driving home from work , and a truck was coming the opposite direction , came over into my lane , ran over the top of my car and his axle tore my arm off .
you look busy . how are you ?
it has no meaning , just — desoto discovers the mississippi , and it &apos;s a desoto discovering the mississippi .
actually any primate will do that .
and how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality .
and so , together with my colleagues , i &apos;ve called for a global conversation about the technology that i co-invented , so that we can consider all of the ethical and societal implications of a technology like this .
you can see it in the way we raise our young kids .
and instead that money went to underwrite the wars in yugoslavia and line the pockets of unscrupulous individuals .
tell my wife i love her very much she knows . &quot; &quot; ground control to major tom , your circuit &apos;s dead , there &apos;s something wrong .
( applause ) you have to separate fact from bias , right .
and that &apos;s going to impact how it &apos;s going to evolve .
we &apos;re going to share lots of things with people , but nothing &apos;s going to happen until we risk putting those ideas into action .
and that this , of course , one of the themes for us is that we think that candor and brutal honesty is critical to us collectively being great parents .
enjoying it so far ? ( laughs ) ( laughter ) sorry , i just feel such a , i feel such a cassandra here . ( laughter )
on the one hand , we can choose between a new golden age where information is more universally available than it &apos;s ever been in human history , where we all have the answers to our questions at our fingertips .
after a kind of long , awkward period of time , steve broke the silence .
don &apos;t black-box history . don &apos;t check your principles at the door .
( applause ) danit peleg : thank you , rebecca .
yet each pales to insignificance with the completion of that magnificent accomplishment of twenty-first-century technology , the digital superhighway .
i convinced my 10th grade english teacher to allow me to do my book report on stephen king &apos;s &quot; &quot; misery &quot; &quot; as an animated short . ( laughter ) and i kept making comics .
that word , &quot; &quot; good , &quot; &quot; and the number 6.8 and the discovery that &apos;s behind it have changed my life .
the thing is , they see their lives and the risks they run decidedly differently .
( laughter ) here &apos;s me , just so we &apos;re even .
we have to take matters into our own hands , not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone — and that &apos;s the hard part — but by improving our own .
i &apos;ve made clear again and again and again that i go to sleep every morning thinking about what i can do for the american people .
little by little it gets colder until eventually it approaches absolute zero .
peers are giving and doing things that are incredibly expensive for companies to do .
when i was a graduate student , it was one of the most exciting times to be working in nanotechnology .
they run some more of the numbers , and at the end of about three or four weeks , turns out they have mapped the exact trajectory of this satellite around the earth , just from listening to this one little signal , going off on this little side hunch that they &apos;d been inspired to do over lunch one morning .
and what went wrong ?
this is sometimes called &quot; &quot; the mama bear effect . &quot; &quot; like a mama bear defending her cubs , when we advocate for others , we can discover our own voice .
and you &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ve got to take this . &quot; &quot; the really beautiful thing is , you know how when somebody &apos;s sitting next to you , sometimes they can sort of hear a little bit of the caller .
so we talked to some sources in hama who we had been back and forth with on twitter , and we asked them about this , and the bridge was interesting to us because it was something we could identify .
those are the ideas where there is no argument in a society , but you are not able to implement those things .
i do not want to have my conclusions tested . &quot; &quot; it feels so much more comfortable simply to lay down the law .
in this respect , the data has gone from a stock to a flow , from something that is stationary and static to something that is fluid and dynamic .
intimacy for us means a lot of different things .
&quot; &quot; if we accept the theory of evolution , then the first dawn of synthesis of life must consist in the production of forms intermediate between the inorganic and the organic world , or between the non-living and living world , forms which possess only some of the rudimentary attributes of life &quot; &quot; — so , the ones i just discussed — &quot; &quot; to which other attributes will be slowly added in the course of development by the evolutionary actions of the environment . &quot; &quot; so we start simple , we make some structures that may have some of these characteristics of life , and then we try to develop that to become more lifelike .
that was his idea of a performance-enhancing drug .
the worship of those we hate .
so i &apos;m like , whoa .
because once john committed himself to putting his life back together — first physically , then emotionally , and then spiritually — he found that there were very few resources available to someone who has attempted to end their life in the way that he did .
second of all , i &apos;ll bet even you people who are untrained can see the difference , and we see here an st segment elevation right after this sharp line .
child : i think he is going to take that one .
tg : i believe that beauty is a basic service .
the bonobo , although shorter than us and their arms still longer , is more upright , just as we are .
i got into it because i wanted to help people feel better .
you don &apos;t need this for what you can get in wal-mart ; you need this for what makes you unique .
i was just so tired .
we dug and dug and dug , and there wasn &apos;t another bone around .
researchers at emory gave children a simple &quot; &quot; what do you know &quot; &quot; test .
hollywood gathers around power tables , and the valley gathers around power tables .
this is actually just a picture of the earth at night , and i &apos;m just putting it up because i think it &apos;s pretty .
and what we &apos;re looking for is the tiny dimming of light that is caused by a planet passing in front of one of these stars and blocking some of that starlight from getting to us .
we are but two threads cut from the same cloth .
and we ought to give it to them .
in particular , it tells us why we see immorality .
it &apos;s 40,000 dollars to build the university of pittsburgh medical school .
so how are they going to divide up breadwinning and caregiving responsibilities ?
who just turned out the lights ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) &quot; what &apos;s that over there ? &quot; &quot; what ? &quot;
it would be a personalized chip just for you .
we can &apos;t overestimate the amount of despair that we are generating with places like this .
( laughter ) and we stop listening .
suddenly , we &apos;re back in that trishaw again and we &apos;re bumping off the broad , well-lit streets ; and we &apos;re reminded , really , of the first law of travel and , therefore , of life : you &apos;re only as strong as your readiness to surrender .
i think there is outer truth and there &apos;s inner truth .
and the second thing it does , and it gives us a very clear direction of travel for new therapies — i mean , you don &apos;t need to be a rocket scientist to know what to do here .
it &apos;s not true .
it &apos;s very much like the rutting of mammals , including humans , you know , sorting out our differences , but gentler , no biting allowed .
it &apos;s a scraper bike ; it &apos;s called — from oakland .
no , well , i guess when i was a girl , we didn &apos;t really have a name for that either .
it took us about 10 minutes to climb up to the top of that dune , which goes to show why they had to move to a safer location .
so i started taking a look at them . ( music ) i saw one of them that featured a kitten and her mom and wishing her mom a happy mother &apos;s day .
and information will tell her when to go to market with which product .
i &apos;m suffering from gallery fatigue .
( applause ) thank you so much .
journalists , this is off the record ; it &apos;s embargoed .
they warned us earlier that every imaginable mishap has occurred to speakers up here on the stage .
here , this animation is zooming in onto our solar system .
i have friends who are very confident they can do certain things , but i realize that they overestimate their own competence .
but when you want to do something new , you have to apply the physics approach .
why does everyone get rid of me ?
i know when i had a job that required two bus rides and a subway ride every morning , i used to go to the library on weekends to get stuff to read .
you say , &quot; &quot; well , of course i can &apos;t write today , because i &apos;m giving a tedtalk and i have five media interviews , and then i &apos;m going to a cocktail party and then i &apos;ll be drunk after that .
there is more energy flowing through , per gram per second , than anything that we have any other experience with .
now , you can see how this could be a problem , especially because the government considers so much of what it does secret .
but usually that is linked to very strong social disparities .
we still think it is pristine .
any child can say , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m a tiger , &quot; &quot; pretend to be a tiger .
well , this is a lot of water , and again , we &apos;re mining water and using it to grow food , and today , if you travel down further down the colorado , it dries up completely and no longer flows into the ocean .
at the end of that time , i went off to australia , about 20 years ago .
as he was nearing his death , his disciples and followers kept asking him , &quot; &quot; what &apos;s the secret ?
we can start with mongolia , or as some call it , mine-golia .
so , let me just tell you how that goes .
sandy &apos;s story was about the return to the bronx of supreme court justice sonia sotomayor .
and it has not been the case for most of modern american history .
what if travel were like a magnificent buffet of local experiences ?
we don &apos;t know you &apos;re there , so it &apos;s kind of nice to say &quot; &quot; hello &quot; &quot; first .
we have superstar bankers .
( laughter ) and some of you guys are entrepreneurs , etc . , whatever .
this is what it looks like .
and a year after that , we did conquer it .
and so , i want to give you a greeting , as from a chimpanzee in the forests of tanzania — ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh !
and if you manipulate the speed of this rotor , you are actually able to crack the rotor and eventually even have the centrifuge explode .
and from alabama to alaska , a group of women who had always wanted to do something that mattered alongside the best of the best , and to make a difference for their country , answered that call to serve .
( video ) luke massella : i was really sick . i could barely get out of bed .
just when we know we need to be learning to live on the surface of our planet , off the power of sun , wind and waves , we are frantically digging to get at the dirtiest , highest-emitting stuff imaginable .
the other reason is this amazing bush glows .
now , as you gain elevation your iq goes down — ( laughter ) but your emotional affect goes up , which is great for having a mythic experience , whether you want to or not .
ag : we are getting more support .
so the effect that this stroke could have on mario &apos;s body could be the fact that he couldn &apos;t be able to control the left side of his body .
i left san francisco , where i live , on monday , and i was getting on the plane for this conference .
you can burst bubbles .
now , when we think about changing human nature , the first thing that comes to mind are these human modification technologies — growth hormone therapy , cosmetic surgery , stimulants like ritalin , adderall , anti-depressants , anabolic steroids , artificial hearts .
but of course , that only works when we have both of these components .
i &apos;m sure that in this room there are , like , 15 other wonderful stories of nonprofits doing spectacular work .
the modern healthcare sector has totally collapsed .
instead of crying or ceasing our play , instead of waking my parents , with all the negative consequences for me , a smile spread across her face and she scrambled back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn — ( laughter ) with one broken leg .
it &apos;s kind of an extraordinary story when you realize that this is twice as common as homicide and actually more common as a source of death than traffic fatalities in this country .
and i started thinking about a counseling program .
and what &apos;s really , really great about being here is i &apos;m sure that the questions that you guys have are very , very different than the questions that i think up myself .
step back , give your mother a break , okay .
cetaceans and primates have also an autobiographical self to a certain degree .
we &apos;re not born craving whoppers or skittles .
there &apos;s increased hunting and fishing for commercial purposes .
we said that if you stop to swap your battery more than 50 times a year we start paying you money because it &apos;s an inconvenience .
so what you can see now is that the ferrofluid has formed spikes .
&quot; &quot; oh , it &apos;s very easy . it &apos;s the western world and it &apos;s the developing world , &quot; &quot; they say .
and how futile seemed the words of advice to me from great british veteran conductor sir colin davis who said , &quot; &quot; conducting , charles , is like holding a small bird in your hand .
it &apos;s not in their taste , really . it &apos;s not in their texture .
why not apply that to our looking at paintings ?
( laughter ) he had no idea what that was , ( laughter ) so i spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans , and i walked out of the store — truth ! — with the best-fitting jeans i had ever had .
what does the inside of your computer actually look like ?
and artists who were formerly constrained can now do things that were never , ever possible for them before .
because of the overhanging leaves and branches , you &apos;ll notice that the understory is very dark , it &apos;s very still .
so you have to find rocks of the right age , depending on what your interests are .
can you place that down into the floor ?
let me start by asking you a question , just with a show of hands : who has an iphone ?
i was about 10 years old on a camping trip with my dad in the adirondack mountains , a wilderness area in the northern part of new york state .
it &apos;s twice the range of any electric motorcycle .
is it the exposure ? we have professors from mit , berkeley , stanford , indian institute of science who come and teach our children lots of scientific formulas , experiments , much beyond the classroom .
narrator : on january 24th , apple computer will introduce macintosh .
i &apos;d spoken to all the experts .
that &apos;s another argument for why we need to step into the lab and really measure the impact of technology on the brain .
as it turns out , these two abilities are also essential for all of us to function well in our society .
and just as one example of the kind of thing you can do , you can take a complex network , use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense network .
and i went there a few months ago — photos are still there — and it was missing a piece of the eye .
and of course , there &apos;s nothing special about cromwell or bladders — you have just breathed in a nitrogen atom that passed through the right lung of the third iguanodon to the left of the tall cycad tree .
both poets , writers , creatives with a long history of community work behind us , and big , huge dreams of a family in front of us , we shared a lot of things in common , but we were also incredibly different .
early visions of wireless power actually were thought of by nikola tesla basically about 100 years ago .
so where do we go from here ?
and when we go to cop15 at the end of this year we can &apos;t stop thinking of padding co2 .
one of the most impressive things about what some , perhaps 10 , of the speakers have been talking about is the realization , as you listen to them carefully , that they &apos;re not saying : well , this is what we should do ; this is what i would like you to do .
i think that &apos;s rather creepy , actually . why would a neighborhood have a logo ?
all of these new technologies just offer tremendous opportunities for us to be able to impact the individuals with autism , but yet we have a long way to go .
so now i ask you , how do i feel when the time finally comes and there &apos;s another dark night , sometime between midnight and 2 a.m. ?
the most surprising thing that i &apos;ve learned while running this contest is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research .
not quite the whole truth . anyway .
and so , the place that we took it to was this place called a brine pool , which is in the northern part of the gulf of mexico .
but unfortunately he gets sick . he gets really sick at the end of the story .
egyptians on social media were wondering , &quot; if tunisia did it , why can &apos;t we ? &quot;
so why all the big deal about genetics ?
let &apos;s start with the global challenge of urbanization .
when she gives birth to the first girl child , first daughter , she is sad .
physicists have told us for a long time that the metal of that train looks solid but really it &apos;s mostly empty space with microscopic particles zipping around .
but i &apos;d also like to point out that the oceans are much more connected than we think .
that &apos;s why they don &apos;t know whether their mutual fund manager is taking 0.1 percent or 0.15 percent of their investment , but they clip coupons to save one dollar off of toothpaste .
and at that point , the universe mysteriously starts accelerating its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger-scale structure .
so this is jonathan . he &apos;s 37 years old . he has a master &apos;s degree .
so here , in wool , through a domestic feminine art , is the proof that the most famous postulate in mathematics is wrong .
we &apos;re now 6.8 billion people , and we &apos;re expected to be 9 billion people by 2050 .
i &apos;d just like to point out , if you look at the map of africa , it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape .
the fear is the child .
now , unfortunately , i don &apos;t have a solution to this problem , apart from recommending that more of us think about it .
ev : dark chocolate with almonds .
we all live in this fast-paced , digital world , but we still crave and desire something that &apos;s relatable .
when you look at the incredible work that my colleagues are doing all around the world and what they &apos;re finding , i believe that there are millions of undiscovered archaeological sites left to find .

i was working on the cranial collections , and it just struck me as ironic that here were people coming to see this gory , primitive , savage culture that they were almost fantasizing about and creating without really understanding what they were seeing , and all the while these vast — i mean hundreds of thousands of skulls in our museums , all across europe and the states — were kind of upholding this enlightenment pursuit of scientific rationality .
obviously the church weren &apos;t very happy about this , and they tried to suppress it , but what they hadn &apos;t counted on was technology , and then they had the printing press , which suddenly enabled these ideas to spread cheaply , far and fast , and people would come together in coffee houses , discuss the ideas , plot revolution .

you don &apos;t need the 30-day waiting period .
and there was one more big soulful lesson , and that one i learned from albert einstein .
we were asked to undertake a study and investigate the potential of a site out in stratford in the olympic park .
and in that disconnected state , yeah , we can build factory farms with no windows , destroy marine life and use rape as a weapon of war .
darwin worried about the relationship between what he said and the truths of religion , but he could proceed , he could write books about his subject without having to say what the relationship was to the religious claims , and similarly , geologists increasingly could talk about it .
and if you take a look at the headline of stage five , which is &quot; &quot; life is great , &quot; &quot; this may seem a little incongruous .
in fact there are people in this room who may not want me to show you this clip we &apos;re about to see .
( applause ) the parking meter , invented in oklahoma city .
what if instead we just got really curious about what was happening in our momentary experience ?
jim cameron actually photographed the real titanic .
glucose is very important , and we know it &apos;s involved with diabetes .
in the past , i talked about it .
forty of the 50 most dangerous cities in the world are right here in latin america , 13 in brazil , and the most dangerous of all , it &apos;s san pedro sula , honduras &apos; second city , with a staggering homicide rate of 187 murders per 100,000 people .
and the result of that is , we &apos;re going to generate 83,000 new jobs , four billion dollars a year in annual income , and reduce the co2 emissions by 174 million tons a year .
so now we have a whole extended bacteria family , filled with virus sleeper cells .
as a quarter of the world population is influenced by it , you &apos;d be wise to do something about that .
so we documented this invention step by step on a website for inventors called instructables , in the hope that somebody would make it even better .
and this is so powerful that when they tweak their stats , when they say your crops wilt after eight hours , or after six hours , or after 24 hours , it changes the life cycle of some 70 million people during the day .
mark lynch , he &apos;s an amazing teacher and he &apos;s still a dear friend of mine , and i was 14 or 15 , and i walked into his comic book class halfway through the course , and i was so excited , i was beaming .
thank you .
so when the children see this , they say , &quot; &quot; ah ! acceleration , &quot; &quot; remembering back four months when they did their cars sideways , and they start measuring to find out what kind of acceleration it is .
so we started out trying to figure out . how do we get to 10 cents ?
they are less likely to see a therapist , less likely to be diagnosed with depression , less likely to be taking prescription medication .
it &apos;s not permanently in the exclusive economic zones of these five central american countries , but it moves with the season .
&quot; until you can get home ? &quot;
we &apos;re not just talking about a few pages of ones and zeros .
now is the time to create change in this industry and to push it into a sustainable direction .
the first component of the story that i thought was essential , however , was to give readers a sense of appreciation for the ocean animals that they were eating .
it was three steps .
so that plan was going really well , except the coding part , and then one morning a few months ago , i woke up to the news that the wife of a certain presidential candidate had given a speech that — ( laughter ) ( applause ) that sounded eerily like a speech given by one of my other faves , michelle obama .
bina rothblatt : it &apos;s been really an exciting journey , and i would have never thought that at the time , but we started making goals and setting those goals and accomplishing things , and before you knew it , we just keep going up and up and we &apos;re still not stopping , so it &apos;s great .
and most importantly , if the staircase is real , it explains the persistent undercurrent of dissatisfaction in modern life .
( video ) pilot : release our fire .
we can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death , seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
who was here or has otherwise seen hans rosling &apos;s talk ?
kyoto protocol system .
so what is open hardware ?
number one : we have to start with digital media literacy , and clearly it must have a gendered lens .
we think about a little boy trying to get to sleep .
this is a beautiful quote that i found — we &apos;re talking about serendipity there — from alexander fleming : &quot; &quot; when i woke up just after dawn on september 28 , 1928 , i certainly didn &apos;t plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world &apos;s first antibiotic . &quot; &quot; now , the explorers of the world of the atom did not intend to invent the transistor .
what if you could make them fun , attractive , clean , environmentally friendly ?
the ecliptic , which is the path of the sun , moon , and planets correspond to an offset circle .
i can tell you that the data on the number of children per woman is surprisingly good in all countries .
believing in each other , really being sure when push comes to shove that each one of us can do amazing things in the world , that is what can make our stories into love stories and our collective story into one that continually perpetuates hope and good things for all of us .
i think the headline in the new york times was , &quot; &quot; are you packing it on ?
let universality make way for plurality .
they range from 450 million years ago to the last , the k-t , number four , but the biggest of all was the p , or the permian extinction , sometimes called the mother of all mass extinctions .
it looks like a little of string pearls basically — in fact , three strings of pearls .
and the brain specializes for it .
when i travel through megacities from end to end — it takes hours and days — i experience the tragedy of extreme disparity within the same geography .
see those hands there ? these are not built for farming .
players are shown pairs of urban scenes , and they &apos;re asked to choose which one is more beautiful , quiet and happy .
and katy perry drinks her morning coffee out of an amber owl .
well , i eventually got to the rhode island school of design .
&apos;we &apos;ve got to case the joint .
and many , many things at google have come out of that , such as orkut and also google news .
as wealth goes up in a society , the suicide rate goes up instead of down .
the fact is no government in the world , with the exception of a few , like that of idi amin , can seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule .
( laughter ) so i &apos;m listening to all this , you know , and i &apos;m like , is this guy for real ? is he making some of this up ?
it &apos;s something like this : and i had blocks in the pyramid , and the cornerstones being industriousness and enthusiasm , working hard and enjoying what you &apos;re doing , coming up to the apex , according to my definition of success .
and so the question is , &quot; &quot; why is this happening ? &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not being imposed by fiat from above .
and in fact , when you &apos;re turning around , and you &apos;re looking inside the house , and you &apos;re looking for this stuff , this is where you look first , right ?
what does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time ?
they have a broad trans-ideological appeal , and because we want them actually to happen , we figured out ways to do them that do not require much , if any , federal legislation , and can , indeed , be done administratively or at a state level .
we have great examples of that , unfortunately .
wwb : wind , water , birds — stochastic natural sounds composed of lots of individual random events , all of it very healthy , all of it sound that we evolved to over the years .
they watched their children change and they had no idea how to help them .
thank you for that reaction .
whatever it is you are struggling to remember , it is not poised on the tip of your tongue , not even lurking in some obscure corner of your spleen .
and we &apos;re now in a very strange sort of twilight zone , where no one quite knows what &apos;s worked , or what doesn &apos;t .
( laughter ) what is a woman without a clitoris supposed to do with her life ?
the life cycle impact of that lettuce is astronomical .
bring it back up .
yet authorities in countries like the united states , the united kingdom and many other democracies are seeking to use the law to either weaken or outright ban strong encryption , because the bad guys are using it , too .
and not only that , that mycelium connects different individuals in the forest , individuals not only of the same species but between species , like birch and fir , and it works kind of like the internet .
so i wanted to create a new kind of medicine , in order to create a new kind of relationship between the patient and the treatment .
that &apos;s how it works .
and two days later i came to do my next emergency shift , and that &apos;s when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office .
the way i like to put this is : one idea . ideas are meant to be shared , so one idea can serve one world , one market .
so go ahead , ask yourself , what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail ?
one day in rehab someone , started talking about surfing and all these guys who &apos;d never surfed before said , &quot; &quot; hey , let &apos;s go . &quot; &quot; and they went surfing .
the struggle between for and against is the mind &apos;s worst disease . &quot; &quot; now unfortunately , it &apos;s a disease that has been caught by many of the world &apos;s leaders .
in order to sustain our work into the future , we use technology centers where we partner with local universities and colleges to take the technology to them , whereby they then can help us with digital preservation of their heritage sites , and at the same time , it gives them the technology to benefit from in the future .
but this has come as a great boon for them .
( audio ) natalia rybczynski : yeah , i had someone call me &quot; &quot; dr. dead things . &quot; &quot; latif nasser : and i think she &apos;s particularly interesting because of where she digs that stuff up , way above the arctic circle in the remote canadian tundra .
a child &apos;s playstation today is more powerful than a military supercomputer from 1996 .
and they said , &quot; &quot; jeez , you know , we think we could actually take a look at the slope of the doppler effect to figure out the points at which the satellite is closest to our antennae and the points at which it &apos;s farthest away .
again , we just take these lines and recursively replace them with the whole shape .
then , on december 26th last year , just two months ago , that underwater earthquake triggered the tsunami .
i use the garden , the soil , like it &apos;s a piece of cloth , and the plants and the trees , that &apos;s my embellishment for that cloth .
i might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday — that seemed pretty darn unlikely .
whereas before the farmer used to think local — meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market , eight to 10 kilometers away on average , and sell whatever they happened to have , without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was — now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market .
so each building has its own personality .
when muhammad told me his personal story , how his father , 55 years old , collapsed at home , had a cardiac arrest , and it took over an hour for an ambulance arrive , and he saw his father die in front of his eyes , he asked me , &quot; &quot; please start this in east jerusalem . &quot; &quot; i said to myself , i saw so much tragedy , so much hate , and it &apos;s not about saving jews . it &apos;s not about saving muslims .
but yet they &apos;re experiencing something so unbelievably pure , which is before the sound is actually happening .
camp two , another 2,000 feet higher up , what &apos;s called the western cwm .
some of them are not states anymore at all .
and this referendum would propose having those dollars go to law enforcement and safety .
i learned a lesson from it .
and this might be associated with some of the differences in health associated with cesarean birth , such as more asthma , more allergies , even more obesity , all of which have been linked to microbes now , and when you think about it , until recently , every surviving mammal had been delivered by the birth canal , and so the lack of those protective microbes that we &apos;ve co-evolved with might be really important for a lot of these different conditions that we now know involve the microbiome .
but not those babies — not yet .
and , of course , the heartbreaking , flip side of this study , is that they took the &quot; &quot; a students &quot; &quot; and told them they were &quot; &quot; d &apos;s . &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what happened at the end of that three-month period .
it &apos;s a spinning globe , the surface of which is entirely composed of the pictures and words and drawings of people that submitted to the time capsule .
i have started teaching part-time , and with my husband , who juggles several jobs , we &apos;ve opened a small bookshop .
they &apos;re not affronted by differences , they &apos;re fascinated by them , and that is a huge shift in mindset , and once you feel it , you want it to happen a lot more .
some of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores , a greater comfort level with the material , especially with the boys , that in going outside and playing , they aren &apos;t afraid to take on a double-digit multiplication problem — and also that the teachers are able to use these as assessment tools to better gauge how their students are understanding new material .
and what &apos;s worse , what they &apos;re learning there isn &apos;t even practically useful anymore .
so , back to mars .
those who embrace their roles and work to improve their performance grow , change and expand the self .
does the novel show us a way out ? i &apos;m not sure .
as a matter of fact , we think reaching 100 percent is very doable , even before the 2015 timeframe . in other parts of emerging countries , such as india and china , the progress has been good — has been solid , has been good . but in places that are not as developed , places like africa , latin america and other places in the world , the progress has been rather slow . as a matter of fact , i was just recently visiting south africa .
and again , i posted a conductor video , and we started accepting submissions .
they stand for numbers for a particular book .
is it different women who are doing the preserving and the radicalizing ?
( laughter ) behind the humor is the idea of making the cubicle more human . ) david kelley : so here &apos;s the final thing , complete with orange lighting that follows the sun across — that follows the tracks of the sun — across the sky .
( laughter ) so my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone — all races , all religions , all income and education levels .
and we have not had the other side of the argument fully aired so that people can draw their own conclusions .
but perhaps most heartbreaking of all are the stories of the abuse of even the most basic human rights , such as the young woman shown in this image here that are played out every day , sadly , even in the very institutions that were built to care for people with mental illnesses , the mental hospitals .
thank you .
it turns out , atrazine is the largest selling product for the largest chemical company in the world .
it is accepted that for such an aim , knowledge creation , interaction among people , face-to-face contact , it &apos;s important , and we agreed on that .
so a fundamental shift , and now you have environmentalists and economists like ed glaeser saying we are a destructive species .
well , it turns out that those cells used in that laboratory , they &apos;re male cells , and the animals used in the animal studies were male animals , and the clinical trials have been performed almost exclusively on men .
eight years later , when they discovered there was a plot to kill him , they dressed him up like a beggar and snuck him out of the country on horseback , and took the same trip that tamdin did .
first , because as i &apos;ve discussed on this stage before , i learned that the fbi has been monitoring my work .
does that mean that you think that the other things we think our brains are about — the dreaming , the yearning , the falling in love and all these things — are a kind of side show , an accident ?
chris anderson : i just have a couple of questions for you .
these are all complexity questions , and computer science tells us that these are very hard questions .
let &apos;s see what sweden has done .
and you say , &quot; &quot; if you were me , doc , what would you do ? &quot; &quot; and the doc says , &quot; &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot; &quot; and the result is — we call it &quot; &quot; patient autonomy , &quot; &quot; which makes it sound like a good thing , but it really is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision-making from somebody who knows something — namely , the doctor — to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions — namely , the patient .
it looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation .
follow the calculus tag on tumblr , and yes , you will see people complaining about calculus , but you &apos;ll also see people re-blogging those complaints , making the argument that calculus is interesting and beautiful , and here &apos;s a way in to thinking about the problem that you find unsolvable .
it &apos;s getting them wrong that is living .
these were the fears that danced in the imaginations of these poor men , and as it turned out , the fear they chose to listen to would govern whether they lived or died .
and roots and shoots is a program for hope .
and it has , but you also notice , right over there , that it has a very abstract image that it has still managed to recognize and cluster as horses .
we clearly can .
we &apos;ve got to get our hero , captain willard , to the mouth of the nung river so he can go pursue colonel kurtz .
well , they didn &apos;t . they didn &apos;t want to send their books .
so we developed a different approach .
well , surprisingly enough , amazingly enough , the anatomists had a very poor idea of the structure of the lung until very recently .
that implication was studied by boltzmann back in the 19th century .
to claim that he &apos;s &quot; &quot; not really nigerian , &quot; &quot; though , denies his experience in lagos , the rituals he practiced growing up , his relationship with family and friends .
this is peak fishing in a few seconds . the &apos; 60s .
night had fallen , and i went out under this great overturned saltshaker of stars , and i could see the tail lights of cars disappearing around the headlands 12 miles to the south .
last lesson , from a latin american : this is the great poet jorge luis borges .
i loved that i could hide within this shadow my own painted version , and it would be almost invisible until the light changed , and all of a sudden my shadow would be brought to the light .
doesn &apos;t mean that people who are in between don &apos;t experience racism , but it means that the closer you are to white on that spectrum , the better off you are .
well , most of you anyway .
okay , a few of you .
below the surface there is hard saline water .
and i decided that , in fact , i didn &apos;t really want to create complicated stuff .
so all of this money started pouring in , and all of this fame started pouring in .
and to help you , i &apos;ve got two things to leave you with , from two great philosophers , perhaps two of the greatest philosopher thinkers of the 20th century , one a mathematician and an engineer , and the other a poet .
and people in white hats sailing boats .
and so if you change the recipe , and you add things when you pour — so you add things to your liquid silk solution — where these things are enzymes or antibodies or vaccines , the self-assembly process preserves the biological function of these dopants .
i was a child , too young to understand the circumstances of my being there .
we gotta do something different . we gotta think radical .
( laughter ) . so they &apos;ve got a little bit of a sibling rivalry thing going on here .
it &apos;s in the developmental power of entrepreneurship , the ethical power of democracy .
and said , &quot; &quot; hi , i &apos;m trying to make a toaster .
i looked but didn &apos;t see .
( applause ) bruno giussani : thomas piketty . thank you .
i would love to see google maps inside some of these caves .
we redid the side of the building and re-proportioned the windows so it sort of fit into the space .
and so reading and educating your emotions is one of the central activities of wisdom .
so what &apos;s actually happening is that social networks and real-time technologies are taking us back .
the women in this room and watching in l.a.
i thought , the love you have for your children is unlike any other feeling in the world , and until you have children , you don &apos;t know what it feels like .
at the same time , for me and for many other people , that view is a bit too close to simply denying the datum of consciousness to be satisfactory .
so , her caretakers took her to the village medicine man , and instead of suggesting to the caretakers that the girl be taken to a hospital , the person decided to burn her abdomen with red-hot iron bars to drive out the demons .
and unfortunately or fortunately , chemistry won .
fortunately , the big tech companies seem to agree .
and the idea is that the character has an inner motor , a dominant , unconscious goal that they &apos;re striving for , an itch that they can &apos;t scratch .
hey , hey black-eyed susie , hey .
it &apos;s a nonprofit , venture capital fund for the poor , a few oxymorons in one sentence .
so my team has taken five days-worth of growth , a typical growth cycle for us , and condensed it into a 15-second time lapse .
they were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves .
and my theme was this : our earth has existed for 45 million centuries , but this one is special — it &apos;s the first where one species , ours , has the planet &apos;s future in its hands .
so does all this matter ? or is globaloney just a harmless way of getting people to pay more attention to globalization-related issues ?
he &apos;s had that arm for about 20 months , so he &apos;s pretty good with it .
and you might say , &quot; &quot; can you really be that specific ?
and on the surface , cassini has found liquid .
what &apos;s it gonna look like ? we have huge grand challenges these days of habitat loss . we have more and more people , billions of people , in 100 years , god knows how many people , and how little space there will be to fit all of them , so we need to change the way that we see cities , and looking at this picture on the left of new york city today , you can see how gray and brown it is .
imagine a coil . for those of you that are engineers , there &apos;s a capacitor attached to it too .
i &apos;m pleased to say that there is now also a website looking at effective animal organizations .
what we saw is a lot of people — actually , at the beginning , we saw a lot more people opening the app because they were curious what they would find when they opened it .
several of these nutrients are essential chemical elements : phosphorus , nitrogen and calcium .
and i understand that .
let me show you what you could do right now .
this is great smoky mountains national park , and the hemlocks are dead as far as the eye can see .
so we prowl from house to house looking for flies captured in spider webs and we set them free .
so we go out for about five months every summer in a 20-meter catamaran , and we live , sleep and work at sea for weeks at a time .
and so this woman , mrs. young-soon han , i suppose will have taught me the most that i have learned about race .
for those of you who &apos;ve been there , fantastic coral reefs , fantastic diving , fantastic snorkeling .
and this is all over mathematics and this is all over computer science , and there &apos;s a really deep connection between empathy and these sciences .
and in the spring , when the sun returns to the ice , it forms the phytoplankton , grows under that ice , and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed , and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life .
and we quickly realized that our coming together was more than just a union of two people , but was a model of possibility for the millions of lgbtq folks who have been sold this lie that family and matrimony is antithetical to who they are — for those of us who rarely get to see ourselves reflected in love and happiness .
so i decided , i &apos;m going to make this a real biennial .
( applause ) and that number is really powerful , because last year we only graduated 7,500 women in computer science .
so given the prince loved his music , haydn thought he &apos;d write a symphony to make the point .
( applause ) so i just want to say a couple more things about that particular story , and then try to generalize how could we have stories of success all over the place for these diseases , as sam says , these 4,000 that are waiting for answers .
so what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an asian person and a european person by looking at their ingredients list .
basically , i was brought up to be a good samaritan , and i am .
since i joined twitter in 2011 , misogyny and misogynists have amply demonstrated they will dog my every step .
we &apos;re on the verge of a whole new social science .
what is a chubby , curly-haired guy from holland — why is he whistling ?
he sees something in the path .
she did things she always wanted to do .
i &apos;ve brought with me , from southern california , the fm device .
this is a very , very low level in order to be kicked out of the health care system .
and in a plastic-wrapped and packaged world , he doesn &apos;t hold out much hope for that , either .
and providing data free of charge on the internet , for the world to use . thank you very much .
rsw : no . what did he say ?
( laughter ) so , it was in the course of these investigations that i ran into a map .
this is happening today .
i mean , it was so incredibly close .
they were basically a city living with a modern kind of industrial metropolis with an elizabethan public infrastructure .
i went there looking for truth .
it takes 20 years to produce somebody with a ph.d.
my bosses , in the beginning , were very surprised .
well , then you look to europe , and the most important alliance in the world has been the transatlantic relationship .
and some of this , again , is in the realm of political work .
on a typical day , do you wake up with hope or gloom ?
and after we failed , i just kept failing .
it had to be shipped to london .
ca : okay . so , thank you , mark .
so our team released a very easy , simple-to-use tool in plain language to help people prepare , to help ease their nerves , to help them feel more confident in taking the next step in pursuing their american dream .
and the problem is , that turns you into a shrewd animal who treats life as a game , and you become a cold , calculating creature who slips into a sort of mediocrity where you realize there &apos;s a difference between your desired self and your actual self .
and we didn &apos;t find a single record of any preference about goals , treatments or outcomes from any of the sets of notes initiated by a doctor or by a patient .
so for instance , we are asking ourselves , how can we create more light ?
and the exciting thing is it &apos;s starting to grow .
( applause ) chris anderson : stop . i &apos;ve got two questions .
but we only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged brain compared to the brain of an alzheimer &apos;s patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease .
it &apos;s just the female .
i became so hysterical over her treatment , that eventually , she was just beaten behind closed doors .
we have a long history of strong , courageous , independent women , ever since the viking age .
there &apos;s not a lot of clickiness .
i achieved access to the data , and today i &apos;m able to do physics at the level of the best astronomer , using sound .
his friends and former students became his doctors .
i hope that you will be able to see not just my taliban-like beard , but also the richness and color of my perceptions , aspirations and dreams , as rich and colorful as the satchels that i sell .
i &apos;ll tell you very quickly how the effect works .
for almost a century , we didn &apos;t know much about these .
am i going to be asexual ? &quot; &quot; because from what i knew about fgm , the whole aim of it was to control the sexuality of women .
to be clear , i &apos;m not suggesting that we do away with countries .
and suddenly the most amazing things started coming out of our daughters &apos; mouths .
we &apos;re now on the couch , looking out through the window at cars passing by .
people low on it like things that are familiar , that are safe and dependable .
they are 75 percent of the energy consumption — up to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
as i said , all the balconies can move , but they can also be disappeared completely .
consider that blue icon for a ted talk that you &apos;re writing .
they &apos;ve probably got these environmental risk factors and / or genetic risk factors we don &apos;t know about .
there &apos;s no waste .
and even being here — i mean , the last few days , i &apos;ve known heights of obsessive behavior i never thought about .
( breathes in ) ( breathes out ) so , i didn &apos;t always make my living from music .
but i think today that most would agree that greece was only a symptom of much deeper structural problems in the eurozone , vulnerabilities in the wider global economic system , vulnerabilities of our democracies .
they will say the worst things about you .
and , sadly , we don &apos;t know .
( laughter ) so why do we think that our choice of a four dollar shade-grown fair trade artisanal cup of coffee in a reusable mug matters , but what we do with 4,000 dollars in our investment account for our ira doesn &apos;t ?
and humor is a good way , i think , to address serious issues .
when the soul lies down in that grass , the world is too full to talk about .
they have the people and the government with this exclusive dependency , but the problem here is that congress has evolved a different dependence , no longer a dependence upon the people alone , increasingly a dependence upon the funders .
and after i left mattel , i started all these hamburger makers , and then got the license to make the maker .
this is one of the best-known phenomena in the quantum world , quantum tunneling .
that was fall of &apos; 95 . but then , by the time that winter was rolling around , he said , &quot; &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
many people said that night that it was the first time that they had a meaningful religious experience in their entire lives .
it gives us some information vegetables ; it gives us some information dessert .
we often dwell on human trafficking survivors &apos; victimization .
these were literally wild-posted all over new york one night , and there were definitely some heads turning , you know , people smoking and , &quot; &quot; huh ! &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and it was purposely done to look fairly serious .
conservation issues are normally guided towards rare , endemic plants , but what we call exotic plants , that is , the ones which grow in many different habitats across the world , they also need to be considered .
the second thing we believe is we believe in going with the grain of human nature .
when the industrial revolution started , the amount of carbon sitting underneath britain in the form of coal was as big as the amount of carbon sitting under saudi arabia in the form of oil .
it tries to balance out , and that &apos;s just .
and that would remind you that you would want to then introduce your friend ed cook .
3.8 billion years of field-testing .
there &apos;s something in new york city .
and it goes with a book that says , &quot; &quot; read my pins . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) pm : so is this a good idea .
that area of design interests me the most , and i think this for me is a real clear , very simplified version of what i &apos;m talking about .
as whole human beings , we will be better caregivers and breadwinners .
as one cmu prisoner said , &quot; we &apos;re not being tortured here , except psychologically . &quot;
so if you measure the precursor signal , you can actually identify pre- and post-maturity problems in advance .
and you know , and the troubling thing is that it &apos;s much easier to do something bad than to defend against all possible bad things , so the offensive uses really have an asymmetric advantage .
but this is not an ancient conflict .
ca : c &apos;mon , c &apos;mon . martial arts , games . c &apos;mon .
when you are told that carrots have human rights because they share half our genes — but not how gene percentages confer rights — wizard .
even the cowboys are pit crews now .
and meanwhile , at acting school ...
remember when images were first possible with a computer , those gorgeous , full-color images ?
now , what &apos;s important about what these people are doing is that they &apos;re beginning to learn how to communicate with species that are not us but share a common sensory environment .
it says , &quot; &quot; i will be a little late for school tomorrow . &quot; &quot; he was supposed to be in the school at 8 a.m.
so the idea that we can actually involve people in doing this thing together , collectively .
we &apos;ve got to wake up to the fact that we don &apos;t have any more and that this is a finite planet .
it &apos;s not special to us .
can we harness these same technologies for an emotionally sensitive output ?
( laughter ) and again , we think that &apos;s perfectly normal and natural , but that has not been the case for most of human history .
i must say there is magic in these moments .
my wife &apos;s loveliness almost consumes me .
if you drove past solly somewhere out on the reserve , you look up in your rearview mirror , you &apos;d see he &apos;d stopped the car 20 , 50 meters down the road just in case you need help with something .
i remember the searchlight that followed me when i made the night runs from my barrack to the latrine .
we need — we don &apos;t know where this thing is going .
as a matter of fact , ethologists know this .
so what do i have to do ?
it &apos;s being resolved at the level of items , or ideas , or words , if you want .
but in most of the rest of the world , that &apos;s not the case .
and third is that their image has nothing to do with africa and with ethiopia .
so one thing slammed up against another , such as in sao paulo here .
this is a remote operated vehicle beneath the ocean .
there &apos;d be virtually no learning curve .
he &apos;s speechless , but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best orators cannot .
and she said , you know , she &apos;s 90 . she &apos;s running out of time , she said .
you &apos;re probably thinking that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
really , it &apos;s just three things this whole age will be remembered for .
it took about three to four hours to run the simulation .
the last generation &apos;s problem was , we need more food and we need it cheap .
okay , you simply wouldn &apos;t .
ot : thank you .
( laughter ) and there is some truth to this , in the sense that we have something of a finite resource , and increased growth is going to push up demand for that .
sort of leadership by humiliation .
that would save hundreds of millions of dollars in legal costs in the united states and would decrease the cost of medicine for everyone .
because it turns out that the number one cancer in women , breast cancer , is regulated by estrogen and by this enzyme aromatase .
the little lego car in the beginning of the video references the big , real car near the end of the video .
we decided to give it a try , because we thought , &quot; &quot; hey , how hard could it be ? &quot; &quot; we have already an autonomous vehicle .
and this next postcard was made out of one of those photos .
so we bought 100,000 books and sent them to india .
and is it fair to say that it &apos;s simple ?
in other words , it is theoretically possible that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable of creating human beings that glow in the dark .
so , if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs , at some stage , the next step of the ladder has to follow .
and he beat me too . but that didn &apos;t change the fact that it was a nightmare for my family ; it was a nightmare .
hopefully it won &apos;t stutter .
so what you see here is a subtraction of areas in which there &apos;s more brain activity when you &apos;re playing people compared to playing the computer .
i estimated that , just today , across the world , we spent about 106 average world lifetimes teaching people how to calculate by hand .
we also have the mathematics to describe how neurons collect information , and how they create a little lightning bolt to communicate with each other .
where had he gone ?
they &apos;re made by the gazillions in china and india , and we can source them anywhere in the world , build the chair anywhere , and most importantly repair it , even out in a village with a local bicycle mechanic who has local tools , knowledge and parts available .
here &apos;s our hamburger cutaway .
when you make an investment , what you &apos;re really saying is , &quot; &quot; i accept that any one of these 100 things could happen to me and determine my wealth . &quot; &quot; now you can try to move your outcomes around .
you &apos;re live .
but there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it .
no , no , no , shush . we &apos;ve got to go quickly .
the low estimate is the nuclear energy industry estimate of nuclear .
a few years ago , a university student asked me , &quot; what is the greatest surprise in your life ? &quot;
in the worst cases , there are simply not enough jobs in the public health sector , where most poor people are treated , not enough political will , not enough resources , not enough anything — just too many patients with no care .
and then the child turned two , and i started using the cheap and easy treatment , and i wonder &quot; &quot; — and she wondered , like all parents who lose children wonder — &quot; &quot; if there isn &apos;t something that i could have done , like keep on using that complicated , expensive cure . &quot; &quot; and she told all the other people , and she said , &quot; &quot; how could it possibly be that something that &apos;s cheap and simple works as well as something that &apos;s complicated and expensive ? &quot; &quot; and the people thought , &quot; &quot; you know , you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s very important to learn that math is a great way to do that .
because i want to show the people what does data retention mean .
fourth , we only execute 20 milliseconds &apos; worth of that strategy .
space that exists within us , and without us .
and they face limitations , constraints , they may be weak , they may be located in the wrong part of the world , they may be einstein , stuck away farming someplace in a rural village in india not being noticed , as was the case for ramanujan for a long time , a great mathematician but nobody noticed .
i &apos;ve seen all sorts of animals fall in , and what &apos;s shocking to me , is the process is pretty much the same .
so , i want to show the trailer , and then i &apos;m going to take apart one scene in detail .
he and his team had been documenting the over 4,000 lynchings of african-americans that have happened in the american south .
and he is credited with doing over 4,000 of these public surgeries , wandering around in europe , which is an astonishing number , when you think that surgery must have been a last resort .
so the question is , how can you carry a pilot around the world with an airplane that uses the same amount of energy as a big christmas tree ?
you know , i &apos;ve realized that wolfram alpha actually gives one a whole new kind of computing that one can call knowledge-based computing , in which one &apos;s starting not just from raw computation , but from a vast amount of built-in knowledge .
my mum wanted to , couldn ’ t afford it .
they &apos;re flower-feeders , and as they move from flower to flower , basically on a shopping trip at the local floral mart , they end up providing this valuable pollination service .
that i am someone who has drunk , drank , drunk of the bitter dregs of near-disaster in childhood and emerged not just unscathed but strengthened .
forty percent of municipalities self-report dumping raw or partially treated sewage into our waterways .
( laughter ) so jake cress is this furniture maker , and he makes this unbelievable set of furniture .
we proved with those measurements that crocodiles scaled isometrically .
it &apos;s certainly something he can relate to .
and the fish also were happy to be there .
he made a lot of really interesting cultural references .
i danced through chemo and radiation cycles , much to the dismay of my oncologist .
and i think part of what i &apos;m learning in this process is that one must allow oneself to feel grief .

and it turns out that they behave like quantum particles .
but you also need to have values .
for the first time in years , shi &apos;ites were allowed to make the pilgrimage to karbala to observe ashura , and i was amazed by the sheer number of people and how fervently they practiced their religion .
meanwhile , another little girl tried everything she could think of until she slid the red button , the cute doggie popped out , and she squealed with delight .
so he &apos;s got memory .
the mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra .
we &apos;ve heard a lot about the promise of technology , and the peril .
in the oil and mining sector , for example , there is now the beginning of a truly worldwide transparency standard that could tackle some of these problems .
merci . we have to prepare for the following performance , and i have a question for you , and the question is this : you show up in places like the ones you just have shown us , and you are carrying a camera and i assume that you are welcome but you are not always absolutely welcome .

a 21-year-old monk . he was very happy .
and of course , the name of the giant is goliath and the name of the shepherd boy is david , and the reason that story has obsessed me over the course of writing my book is that everything i thought i knew about that story turned out to be wrong .

and six , the work ethic .
and i think that there is an easy cure for ndd .
these were evolved in very different times — we &apos;d like to actually change those programs .
we all know .
in the case of disgust , what is a little bit more surprising is the scope of this influence . it makes perfect sense , and it &apos;s a very good emotion for us to have , that disgust would make me change the way that i perceive the physical world whenever contamination is possible .
the real question : is this distorted worldview what we want for americans in our increasingly interconnected world ?
and this nonpartisanship is something that exists , that has existed in secret in america for years and years and years .
60,000 species are known to science , but more than 1.5 million have been estimated to exist .
what about if we use a big hammer and we swing it and we hit the nail like this , in the place of putting the hammer on the nail and pushing and try to put it in ? that won &apos;t work .
they &apos;ve studied the institutions that facilitate our trade , like legal systems , corporations , marketplaces .
it &apos;s true , we &apos;ve got a huge food problem , but this isn &apos;t science .
why didn &apos;t dad say art ? why wasn &apos;t it okay ?
which i found very interesting that it was going full cycle : i was making comments about the press and about how we know facts and information only by media — because we don &apos;t know the real people ; very few of us know the real people — but it was going back into the press and they were publicizing , effectively , my filthy work .
clicking on a train wreck just pours gasoline on it .
( laughter ) up until our mother asked him to leave and not come back , bageye had been a terrifying ogre .
and so i feel so blessed with everything that i have , that two days a week i go and i counsel hiv patients .
so one squared is one , two squared is four , three squared is nine , five squared is 25 , and so on .
talking about income inequality , even if you &apos;re not on the forbes 400 list , can make us feel uncomfortable .
and yes , we africans can .
maybe it was the optimism that i had about america that made me take a while to understand that things were not going to change .
now what does this all have to do with social problems ?
i want to tell you some stories that explain my view .
so a couple of observations stand out for me from this slide .
so we asked those guys to do it again .
things get more interesting .
not necessarily , no .
here &apos;s nylon going back to caprolactam back to carpet .
in a thankfully voluntary section of okcupid , you are allowed to rate how attractive you think people are on a scale between one and five .
in fact , i &apos;ll just go into one area — if you &apos;re looking at alzheimer &apos;s , for example , drug discovery — there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out because scientists in that field realize this is a great way of getting out of those silos , because they had their genomics data in one database in one building , and they had their protein data in another .
you know , from the hindsight of history , what &apos;s always most inexplicable and inexcusable are the simple failures of compassion .
now , this was a mystery in the new york times where the honey was very red , and the new york state forensics department came in and they actually did some science to match the red dye with that found in a maraschino cherry factory down the street . ( laughter ) so you can tailor your honey to taste however you want by planting bee-friendly flowers .
you have to act compassionately .
in 1998 , human embryonic stem cells were first identified , and just nine years later , a group of scientists in japan were able to take skin cells and reprogram them with very powerful viruses to create a kind of pluripotent stem cell called an induced pluripotent stem cell , or what we refer to as an ips cell .
and where health begins is not in the four walls of a doctor &apos;s office , but where we live and where we work , where we eat , sleep , learn and play , where we spend the majority of our lives .
hey , why not ?
so , three years ago i discovered , the letters m-i-t occurring in simplicity and complexity .
because if you can &apos;t get it in nashville , you can travel to birmingham , two hours away , and you &apos;ll get it . if you can &apos;t get it in cleveland , you can go to cincinnati . we don &apos;t have that luxury , so we have to make it happen .
three things stand out : leadership , diplomacy and institutional design .
and they would coalesce for just a moment , so you could perceive that there was a chair there .
we picked three houses in the center of the community and we start here . we made a few designs , and everybody liked this design of a boy flying a kite the best .
of foremost importance is a thorough , well-organized knowledge of all that is known of the relevant entities and processes that might be involved in that domain you propose to enter .
here &apos;s a key passage where he basically describes the staircase .

they were run by an inexperienced staff , with no visual culture , no budgets for visuals — in many places there were not even art directors .
&quot; &quot; one does not put sugar in green tea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i understand , &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; that the japanese do not put sugar in their green tea , but i &apos;d like to put some sugar in my green tea . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) surprised by my insistence , the waiter took up the issue with the manager .
powerful new technologies always present enigmas .
five , the consumer society .

so here &apos;s the cool part .
computer-generated movies are really mainstream today , but it took ed and his colleagues nearly 20 years to create the first full-length c.g. movie .
that was actually caused by a school of parrot fish that had started eating it , though luckily , they lost interest before killing it .
and so then he looks at me .
and , in fact , it was a system where we would layer primarily communal spaces , stacked to more and more individual and private spaces .
this is carnegie hall .
and this is one aspect that truly fascinates me .
all these schools in texas compete with one another to achieve these milestones , and there are bonuses and various other treats that come if you beat the other schools .
we said things like , why can &apos;t people set their own salaries ?
and we go through a period of accelerating expansion , and the universe expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent , then to the dark ages , and then the first stars turn on , and they evolve into galaxies , and then later they get to the more expansive galaxies .
there is not only in china , but also in the united states there are some very small , cute but bad cats .
all three were diagnosed with lung cancer , the number one cancer killer of women in the united states today .

you can start to unpack the choices involved because of the side effects .
np : make some noise ! make some noise !
i believe we are the gold .
also we are choosing by looking at what others are choosing .
so by this way , the kid , to take care of himself , is to take care of this living object .
now because we haven &apos;t fully processed this information , it &apos;s kind of coming back to us in our pop culture in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways , where you can see that the stereotypes are changing .
i &apos;m instead just going to remind you of the point that bmi teaches us .
could you work on that problem ? &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s how gps was born .
you &apos;ve mastered fire .
so islamophobia isn &apos;t just the natural response to muslim terrorism as i would have expected .
i &apos;m an artist , so i &apos;d like to offer a modest proposal at the intersection of art , science and culture .
because it &apos;s hollow , it &apos;s lightweight , light enough to be lifted by just a few men , or , apparently , one woman .
after extensive research and testing of different materials like rubber , which i realized was too thick to be worn snugly on the bottom of the foot , i decided to print a film sensor with electrically conductive pressure-sensitive ink particles .
in the next 10 years , china will surpass the u.s.
sometimes you might put a band-aid in place to try and temporarily stop the pain .

giles was the first resident in the first house of the first charity that i set up to pioneer services for autism .
and i said , i &apos;ll measure them . they &apos;ll get a zero .
the arctic ice cap is , in a sense , the beating heart of the global climate system .
most of you said u , which is right .
it &apos;s a program through which the government could compel corporate america , it could deputize corporate america to do its dirty work for the nsa .
i can love my wife .
that &apos;s basically the difference .
because it was the temples that organized the harvest , gathered in the grain , offered it to the gods , and then offered the grain that the gods didn &apos;t eat back to the people .
we &apos;d had a great campaign , and to be honest , we &apos;d had our fair share of beer that night , but i said , &quot; &quot; you know what , i think we &apos;ve got one more bar left in us . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so we piled into a taxi , and this is our taxi driver , and i was sitting in the back seat , and he turned around and said , &quot; &quot; where are you going ? &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; hang on , that is an amazing mustache . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and he said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m doing it for movember . &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; so am i. &quot; and i said , &quot; tell me your movember story . &quot;
the temporary building is a triumph of modern industrial organization , a healthy sublimation of the urge to build , and proof that not every architectural idea need be set in stone .

they help us resist disease , and they may even be affecting our behavior .
it has eight motors , four on the knees and four on the hip .
he has since passed away , but was mentally retarded and suffers from severe bone abnormalities .
changing behavior begins with evolving beliefs .

some anthropologists call that the original affluent society .
we steamed up the windows permanently , and every hour we had a different designer come in and write these things that they &apos;ve learned into the steam in the window .
i expected them to say to rob , &quot; hold on . we &apos;re coming . &quot;
they have electricity , but the question is , how many have washing machines ?
so i &apos;m going to show you an example now .

we monitor pygmy rabbits with drones .
i mean , you lose .
i didn &apos;t do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and , well , we didn &apos;t have drugs in those days . but i did competition model airplanes .
instead of blowing a hurricane of chilled air through the stadium , we can use radiant cooling technologies , like a floor heating system where water pipes are embedded in the floor .
waiting for that recognition moment may be the best early indicator of the onset of dementia than anything that shows up clinically today .

i was awkward , insecure , and i hated it .
now typically , this doesn &apos;t lead to any overt illness .
at the bottom right is one that i built in my lab about 10 years ago , and we finally turned that into a product .
now this theory was of more than just intellectual interest to me .
so i will not really go too far into it .
it &apos;s the blockbuster comedy .
so we described these as cool boots .
back on highway 1 , i envisioned what awaited .
so what can we do about this ?

i &apos;m really getting into this now .
every sound the child hears uncorrected is muffled .

i noticed that the house was occupied .
we &apos;ve been hearing them today and yesterday and every day for decades .
so as miraculous as this might seem , unfortunately , well , it &apos;s not that great .
( applause ) june cohen : thank you . so i think many people watching this will be asking themselves the question you just raised at the end : how can they do this in their own city ?
and i got to work on a new approach for breast cancer patients that could do a better job of telling the healthy cells from the unhealthy or cancer cells .
so the ngos become part of a public government system , rather than independent of it .
and my father said , &quot; &quot; why don &apos;t you just go to school ? &quot; &quot; and they sent me off to school , just to get busy somewhere there .

every holiday i had as a young boy was in a national park .
bg : tell me in a few words about your new project , &quot; &quot; híbridos , &quot; &quot; here in brazil .
and one of the really surprising results in the last 20 years has been the discovery of other planets going around other stars .
this premieres in monaco — it &apos;s in september 2009 . if by any chance you can &apos;t make it , another idea with this project — here &apos;s this guy building his legacy through this very unusual form , through music and through the environment .
so that &apos;s definitely going to get through those 200 nanometer holes .
it &apos;s become an art form , a form of sculpture .
so the first lesson is : change and control the narrative .
i was standing , leaning against mahatma gandhi &apos;s statue .
you also know how much labor is needed .
their teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod .
now , take the same problem , chunk it into little modules , and motivations become trivial .
and then i was hearing and seeing and reading warnings from national muslim organizations saying things like , &quot; &quot; be alert , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be aware , &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in well-lit areas , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t congregate . &quot;

the people in the modern world , in the secular world , who are interested in matters of the spirit , in matters of the mind , in higher soul-like concerns , tend to be isolated individuals .
and what this project was doing was taking the effluent of these , and turning them into all of this food .
the website says , &quot; &quot; if you look , there &apos;s an individual mutation , and maybe a second , and maybe a third , and that is cancer . &quot; &quot; but , as a cancer doc , this is what i see .
we are now interdependent .
but those environments are going to be widely spaced in this universe .
you &apos;re kind of building a new type of distributed utility .
but now all of a sudden my job is very different , and my job is to be out here talking about it , talking about introversion .
and what we found was that 99 percent of the patients start to reverse the progression of their heart disease .
in a classroom with a reverberation time of 1.2 seconds , which is pretty common , this is what it sounds like .
it was very important , but mostly interesting because a kind of break , a separation between the mathematics coming from reality , on the one hand , and new mathematics coming from pure man &apos;s mind .
and he proved that you could actually teach people to do surgery using video conferencing .
and the central idea of this work is that the human mind and brain is not a single , general-purpose processor , but a collection of highly specialized components , each solving a different specific problem , and yet collectively making up who we are as human beings and thinkers .
he said that it was a project of peace and unity and that it brought people together .
and so , with funding from the bosack-kruger foundation , i got a lot of strains from these different countries and we measured their toxin production in the lab .
( laughter ) sw : at the zoo we have big cats from the jungle .
so that &apos;s not an accident that those things happen .
you can have no budgets , no people — but still can put your work to the highest possible level .
it &apos;s gotten smaller , it &apos;s got less detail , less resolve .
so they &apos;re quite beautiful , but they &apos;re beautiful because they &apos;re so smart and economical .
there was so much pain and loneliness , there &apos;s so much incredible things when you look in somebody else &apos;s eyes , because in the gaze with that total stranger , that you never even say one word — everything happened .

they &apos;re parodied , sometimes even demonized in the media for their kind of typical teenage behavior . they take risks , they &apos;re sometimes moody , they &apos;re very self-conscious .
you get that , and it &apos;s like a slap in the face .
but again and again , lived compassion brings us back to the wisdom of tenderness .
you will adapt to it and get used to it .

ca : thank you .
the next thing is that if you want to predict the effect of one species on another , if you focus only on that link , and then you black box the rest , it &apos;s actually less predictable than if you step back , consider the entire system — all the species , all the links — and from that place , hone in on the sphere of influence that matters most .

eighty thousand people spread over the entire valley .
and just as flowers spend a lot of effort trying to get pollinators to do their bidding , they &apos;ve also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them and give them to each other at times of birth and death , and particularly at marriage , which , when you think of it , is the moment that encapsulates the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another .

♫ but all the plastic ever made is still here . ♫ ♫ and no amount of closing our eyes ♫ ♫ will make it disappear . ♫ ♫ and the world can &apos;t take it ♫ ♫ very much longer . ♫ ♫ we &apos;re not going to make it ♫ ♫ unless we &apos;re smarter and stronger . ♫ ♫ the world &apos;s gonna shake itself free of our greed ♫ ♫ somehow . ♫ ♫ and the world can &apos;t take it , that you can see . ♫ ♫ if the oceans don &apos;t make it , neither will we . ♫ ♫ the world &apos;s gonna shake itself all the way free ♫ ♫ somehow . ♫
thank you .
and i believe that this is fundamentally a problem , because it doesn &apos;t really allow us to interact with our hands and capture the rich dexterity that we have in our bodies .
( laughter ) no , there &apos;s something else , something really fundamental , and it is : another reason why we don &apos;t have a good brain theory is because we have an intuitive , strongly held but incorrect assumption that has prevented us from seeing the answer .
what could it be ? &quot; &quot; so today , 100 years later , i invite you all on an incredible journey with me , a 37-year-old yale graduate and professor .
and what if we could value it a different way , so it would actually work ?
now , this is an interactive cartoon application .
my brief , as you &apos;ve just heard , is to tell you about statistics — and , to be more precise , to tell you some exciting things about statistics .
she was a state senator at the time , and we met here , at the airport , before a trip to china .
can you imagine what it would be like if amazon or ebay or google or microsoft or apple really went green and you caused that to happen ?
so we &apos;re talking about things like infill development : really sharp little changes to where we have buildings , where we &apos;re developing .
after all , the absence of a duty of care within many professions can all too easily amount to accusations of negligence , and that being the case , can we be really comfortable with the thought that we &apos;re in effect being negligent in respect of the health of our own societies and the values that necessarily underpin them ?
at the eighth stop , a girl came in with a giant duffel bag and announced she had pants for sale for a dollar — like you might sell batteries or candy on the train .
the second : keep mothers healthy , keep mothers alive , keep the children alive — no more orphans .
you see , history &apos;s rich in irony .
but i thought , perhaps the ant won &apos;t know , it &apos;ll probably move in .
someone they were kind to and cared for .
and while remixing and sharing have come to define the web as we know it , all of us can now be part of that story through simple tools that allow us to make things online .
( laughter ) the weather station &apos;s pretty interesting .
and in the same kind of trance that you can feel sometimes in the subway in new york when you &apos;re reading , there &apos;s something really soothing and easy .
for example , i saw pictures and images frequently of sadness and suffering .
i &apos;m playing around with perspectives and analogies .
all of this information is saved in a database that collects about 20,000 feelings a day .
frankly , i joined the army because college is really damn expensive , and they were going to help with that , and i joined the army because it was what i knew , and it was what i knew that i thought i could do well .
we &apos;ll have to .
creativity is essential to all of us , whether we &apos;re scientists or teachers , parents or entrepreneurs .
and interestingly enough , adam smith — the same guy who gave us this incredible invention of mass production , and division of labor — understood this .
scars that run from the middle of my chest all the way out to my outer torso .
so not the habitual architecture that instills in us the false sort of stability , but an architecture that is full of tension , an architecture that goes beyond itself to reach a human soul and a human heart , and that breaks out of the shackles of habits .
but what happened was that he had to be on medication that , at that time — diflucan , which in the states is used for yeast infections — cost 30 dollars a pill .
so that kind of motivational tool that is used actually , in and of itself , has a long-term side effect , in that every time we use a technology that uses something like public recognition or status , we &apos;re actually positively endorsing this as a good and normal thing to care about — that way , possibly having a detrimental effect on the long-term psychological well-being of ourselves as a culture .
in fact , what they did to get food was they got in their cars , drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts , came back with a week &apos;s worth of shopping , and wondered what on earth to do with it .
in the commercials , and on the boxes for the easy-bake ovens , hasbro marketed them specifically to girls .
but , this is not the beginning of the 20th century .
now why is that ?
what is wrong with the people that we have chosen ?
in the 35 years i &apos;ve been a climbing guide and taught on indoor walls , and stuff like that , the most important thing i &apos;ve learned was , guys will always try to do pull-ups .
i may get many sponsors , a lot of money , tons of interviews , and be on tv ! &quot; &quot; i thought .
you know : thank god it &apos;s monday — i get to go back to that little cubicle , those fake gray walls , and hear everybody else &apos;s conversations f or 10 hours and then go home .
it ritualizes the impact of death on families and communities .
it &apos;s really unsatisfactory having plug-in art .
and he puts his cheese sandwich over here on top of the pirate chest .
i &apos;ve taken them camping in the kelp forests of california .
our democracies rely on elections .
it blocks the left on a whole range of issues that we on the left really care about .
saint obi : i was so fascinated , you know , with those cowboy movies .
and maybe , if we want to be on surer footing , what we really want is a moral framework that will help guide us there , that will tell us what kinds of things are right and wrong in the first place , and how would we know in a given situation what to do .
it wouldn &apos;t create the volume that would fill a large space such as the cologne opera house .
well , i was born with a rare visual condition called achromatopsia , which is total color blindness , so i &apos;ve never seen color , and i don &apos;t know what color looks like , because i come from a grayscale world .
so a few examples : we &apos;re now in the era of &quot; &quot; fantastic voyage , &quot; &quot; the ipill .
at the beginning of the project , i numbered all those buildings on my sketch , and there was no real interaction with the community .
is that your final answer ?
you have no way of controlling whether it &apos;ll be used by your side or the other side , by good guys , or by bad guys .
and , using those rules , he was able to say that there are in fact only two objects with six symmetries .
i &apos;m talking about today .
there are so many things to do in this life , and if we could have a simulacrum , a digital doppelgänger of ourselves that helps us process books , do shopping , be our best friends , i believe our mind clones , these digital versions of ourselves , will ultimately be our best friends , and for me personally and bina personally , we love each other like crazy .
but the market also had bypassed low income farmers , because these systems were both too expensive , and they were constructed for fields that were too large .
we conducted about a dozen focus groups with a broad cross-section of black men , and we learned that for them , being healthy was as much about being perceived as healthy as it was about feeling healthy , and that feeling good went hand in hand with looking good .
these are the couples that don &apos;t let anything go unnoticed and allow each other some room to complain .
so i will do this .
i think it &apos;s the wrong question to ask .
so you see , roy price is a senior executive with amazon studios .
you &apos;re in an accident . you &apos;ve got two choices : you &apos;re going to die , or you &apos;re going to take the hydrogen sulfide and , say , 75 percent of you is saved , mentally .
so when you do this sort of reconstruction , if you don &apos;t use some sort of guide image or guide statistics , then you &apos;ll get a sort of confusion of different points of view , because it &apos;s ambiguous .
well , if poor old suki is in search of a mate , what would suki do to find the perfect mate ?
np : standing right there in the corner , &quot; &quot; aw , dad — listen to that . &quot; &quot; ( beatboxing ) naw , i &apos;m kidding . but you know what ?
okay . ah , there is lots of nice bright video .
they brought in hundreds of volunteers , they put them into groups , and they gave them very hard problems to solve .
we have to deal with it .
or have they established their own sort of evolutionary niche that is independent of technology ?
this book i wrote because i want to figure out life .
and medical illustration is still art .
i sort of looked at myself standing there , going , &quot; &quot; oh , jimmy , this is complete loads of codswallop .
my hope is we can actually turn what might be a high-risk moon shot into something that &apos;s more reliable .
i was in india , and i was walking down the streets , and i saw a billboard painter .
it keeps it from being the u.n.
they have been forced off their lands .
or his restaurant , pod , in philadelphia , pennsylvania .
i think the end of the story of the whaleship essex offers an illuminating , if tragic , example .
we walked through these slums , identified houses where children would never go to school .
you can see if someone &apos;s a smoker , you can see what kind of music they like , you can see if they &apos;re going to bring their dog along for the ride .
please join them . turn off your air conditioning and turn on your fans . &quot; &quot; and wouldn &apos;t you know it , they did .
and i wore it whenever i could , thinking it was the most fabulous thing i owned .
kids do worse in the more unequal societies .
xk : do you have a perspective — i don &apos;t want to use &quot; &quot; angle &quot; &quot; because that has a negative connotation — but do you know how this is going to play out ? ( ms : no idea . ) david cohn : how much money does it take to do this ?
however , i will show to you now that we do not need to go to mars to explore alien worlds .
and so i got myself a job and i was working for a consultancy , and we would get in to these meetings , and these managers would come in , and they would say , &quot; well , what we &apos;re going to do here is really important , you know . &quot;
it &apos;s the reason we &apos;re not in the dark ages anymore .
but who is going to want to plug them in ?
but to get it , they would have to &#91; get &#93; it signed by one of the women .
and other people would draw stick figures or smiley faces .
in 1988 , a logging company convinced local residents that there would be absolutely no environmental impact from a new method they were trying called &quot; &quot; selective logging , &quot; &quot; taking out a tree here and there rather than clear-cutting a whole area .
women &apos;s ability to find the right word rapidly , basic articulation goes up in the middle of the menstrual cycle , when estrogen levels peak .
and somehow , tapirs are still there , which gives me a lot of hope .
so that nervous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , tremendously sped up the whole process of evolution .
five to seven percent only are inspected — five to seven percent .
what phenomenon — if it &apos;s not a desert , what phenomenon makes water gush from the ground into the atmosphere with such power that it can be seen from space ?
she rocketed to the top of her class .
in the science of today , we become artists .
we cannot only have grateful experiences .
look at this cartoon by roz chast , the guy reading the obituary .
this is our roof in new york , the roof of the studio .
we also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of 13 related organisms , and we tried to compare all of those , to see what they had in common .
they are shaping the way we consume .
( music : &quot; &quot; rapper &apos;s delight &quot; &quot; by the sugarhill gang ) the mc would improvise lyrics in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies .
but of course , that &apos;s a little bit like kissing your sister as far as driving a car , so the kids want to do a steering wheel ; so they draw a steering wheel .
( applause ) chris asked me to add — the theater is under construction , and this project will start construction in about a year , and finish in 2010 .
( tapping ) so my artistic practice is all about listening to the weird and wonderful noises emitted by the magnificent celestial objects that make up our universe .
a total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear .
the center of life is water .
through constant experimentation with materials , they developed a wide range of iconic solutions that we know today , eventually resulting in , of course , the legendary lounge chair .
and to boot , there was no name for this problem .
for all the scare stories , the actual actions of investors spoke of rapid acceptance and confidence .
and then accounting for things like my shaky voice , and i knew i would be singing about a half-octave higher than normal , because i was nervous .
as a young magician , i was obsessed with houdini and his underwater challenges .
i got tons and tons of generosity from everyone involved .
some of you have seen the flag .
he was looking for a heart attack , that &apos;s what i say .
we &apos;re not doing that well when it comes to insurance .
walk the talk .
so here are some of the works i would like to show you .
but i intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible .
in fact , this effect is so strong that when someone gets a college degree , the spillover effects of this on the wages of others in the metropolitan area are actually greater than the direct effects .
it &apos;s a pretty simplistic approach to root cause analyses .
we &apos;ve had the internet in its public form for almost 20 years now , and it &apos;s still changing as the media becomes more social .
and also for the men alongside whom they served .
thank you .
and so , here you go .
so , thank you . ( applause ) well , i tell you that story because it wasn &apos;t unique to britain .
in the next month , the end of december , you &apos;ll see ovarian cancer , and then lung cancer will come several months after .
it cannot be because of some broadcast mechanism affecting everyone uniformly .
politics has come to resemble a cynical team game played by politicians , while the public has been pushed aside as if sitting on the seats of a stadium in which passion for politics is gradually making room for blindness and desperation .
and as these technologies go forward , you keep seeing this , you keep seeing this , you keep seeing things — 2000 , human genome sequence — and it seems like nothing &apos;s happening , until it does .
we want to avoid death , and the dream of doing that in this body in this world forever is the first and simplest kind of immortality story , and it might at first sound implausible , but actually , almost every culture in human history has had some myth or legend of an elixir of life or a fountain of youth or something that promises to keep us going forever .
and so i think we &apos;re ready to tackle one of the most important questions in neuroscience : how are the brains of men and women different ?
no relationship — gay , straight or anything — that we would regard as remotely healthy or functional looks like that , and yet somehow , you put it on prime time , you slap some makeup on it , throw the glitter on , put it out there as movement , not as text , and we , as a culture , tune in and clap .
and you can see in these central images here , scanning electron micrographs of some of these guys — these are gardens of these bacteria .
a few years before he died , after he had resumed writing poetry , but in secret , he confessed to a friend in a letter that i found when i was doing my research : &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve written a verse .
&quot; yahweh is our savior &quot; means &quot; he has saved the nation of israel , &quot; which at the time , was a pretty high-level social organization .
of course , the criminal justice system treats them as common old garden criminals .
now , it turns out , though , that there are several problems with this model .
the moment you admit to loving someone , you admit to having a lot to lose , and it &apos;s true that these questions do provide a mechanism for getting to know someone quickly , which is also a mechanism for being known , and i think this is the thing that most of us really want from love : to be known , to be seen , to be understood .
he wanted to continue to higher education , but due to his family living on the poverty line , he was soon sent to south africa to work and send back money to feed his family .
they &apos;re not just simple , dumbed-down things that we see in school math .
this is a german orchestra , yes ?
but once you also have people living in close proximity to each other , one of the things you can do is — as information technologies develop — you can start to have smart places .
with my new venture , marilyn monrobot , i would like to use art to create tech .
he &apos;s coached five olympians , and the man &apos;s office is lined from floor to ceiling with all america certificates of all these athletes he &apos;s coached .
audience member 2 : the king .
here &apos;s an example of this similarity .
turns out , ucla has an entire history of pain collection in their archives .
these are stem cells that we create from specific sources , and we can drive them to become heart cells , and they start beating in culture .
maybe you had a direct line .
i was fired five minutes after that .
in every aspect of their lives , they wished for progress , just as we do .
now we get to fight about all sorts of other issues .
now , it &apos;s quite possible that a future martin luther king or a mandela or a gandhi will have an iphone and be protected from government surveillance .
we called legal seafood — ( laughter ) we ordered a bunch of shrimp shells , we grinded them and we produced chitosan paste .
they would make a little bit more money ; their standard of living would shift and would get better .
that &apos;s a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do math , i &apos;m sure .
now the problem with the robots doing this is that they can &apos;t get unstuck , with the material .
these are zebra fish . they &apos;re normally black and silver .
so basically , china is a sick bric country .
( applause ) thank you .
when i was in the third grade , a monumental event happened .
so if we want to utilize self-assembly in our physical environment , i think there &apos;s four key factors .
the nepali women who were trafficked into the sex trade — they came together , and they decided that they were going to make the world &apos;s first anti-trafficking organization actually headed and run by trafficking survivors themselves .
this one , i would say , was a serious challenge .
and now i really like sort of sitting up , you know .
there are many promised lands , depending on your station in society , depending on your stage of life .
let &apos;s talk for a moment about what a model for processing visual information would need to do .
maps matter .
thank you all so much .
copying with variation and selection .
look at a hand . look at a remote control . chair . book .
why should we get away from those arguments ?
let &apos;s not forget these men , who are truly dying to work .
jabbar : then what about the rest of us ?
what experiments would you run ?
what i &apos;m going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas .
now , these people will make guesses , they &apos;ll say things like , &quot; &quot; why am i getting electricity ?
and their response , of course , was no more than we wanted to stop the genocide and put our troops in harm &apos;s way to do that , nor do we now want to get in the way and pluck genocidaires from camps .
b and v , as we said before , were never differentiated in the spanish language — ( applause ) let &apos;s choose one ; it could be either . we can discuss it , talk it over .
if we want humanity to last forever , we have to colonize the milky way .
it &apos;s thoroughly modern biggie .
and ultimately , we have to try that .
when these particles get to the road , they sense some kind of obstacle , and they bounce against it .
and michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt .
i bought some super sculpeys , some armature wire , some various materials .
it provoked tears as well as incisive questions about unarmed peace-keeping forces and the double-dealing of a western society that picks its moral fights with commodities in mind .
and if our fates are intertwined , then we believe that it is good karma , it is good fortune .
and here were are . we have a continuum in the world .
this is the basis for the device that these two guys at ford built .
what is completely lacking is a class of people who have immense amounts of power , but no money at all .
i do a lot of work for the school of visual arts , where i teach , and the director of this school — a remarkable man named silas rhodes — often gives you a piece of text and he says , &quot; &quot; do something with this . &quot; &quot; and so he did .
well , we asked thousands of people .
but we &apos;re coming to appreciate , is the transition from 2d to 3d , from programming bits to programming atoms , turns the ends of moore &apos;s law scaling from the ultimate bug to the ultimate feature .
what do you want in terms of medical intervention ?
thank you .
the only thing singing today would be the facts , for i have truly embraced by inner nerd .
my first semester in spanish , i got a d.
and we shall see what will happen with these countries .
i &apos;ve been part of a social movement that has been working on ending violence against women and children .
don &apos;t feel ashamed .
this is certainly not a cure for spinal cord injury , but i begin to believe that this may lead to an intervention to improve recovery and people &apos;s quality of life .
i wouldn &apos;t be able to talk about this here unless i had done it a few times .
now imagine that women are represented here , and men are represented here .
those of you who are from boston know that this was the moment — rare — where the red sox won the world series .
another thing is the answer was there all along , but we kind of ignored it because of this obvious thing .
so in my group , what we try to do is reverse engineer how humans control movement .
but not everyone can afford an iphone .
what i &apos;m pitching you today is actually not a stand-alone product .
it didn &apos;t come down by a verdict of somebody else .
it &apos;s a huge network under the surface of the tepui plateau , and in only ten days of expedition , we explored more than 20 kilometers of cave passages .
the first of these is natural selection — that &apos;s random mutation and selective retention — along with our basic anatomy and physiology — the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails .
and why can they serve that much ?
i do so many things on this little device .
&quot; &quot; the hour from night to day .
why do we respond so much to our knowledge of where something comes from ?
now this noise is so great that society places a huge premium on those of us who can reduce the consequences of noise .
they &apos;re changing the scale of what we can do , and what we &apos;ve developed is something we call fftt , which is a creative commons solution to building a very flexible system of building with these large panels where we tilt up six stories at a time if we want to .
first one is the political system .
as i said to you , this is the first time i &apos;ve shown this in public .
we depend on the fact that audiences , such as yourselves , will make assumptions .
i &apos;m a performer .
whether you &apos;re in the hierarchy or the heterarchy , it &apos;s a wonderful design challenge .
the challenge is we don &apos;t know the shape of the extra dimensions .
on your left side , you have &quot; &quot; operation smile . &quot; &quot; it is a computer-generated map of a social network .
these include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight .
but it &apos;s not just about policing government .
and the key is to promote a positive african attitude towards africa .
and this is a technically creative challenge , and it would change the perspective of people who worked on it .
judge forer quits , and ms. dewey in completely disheartened .
she was earning 450 dollars . she was doing okay .
william gregory was convicted of rape and burglary .
and the organization draws together people of different generations , like holly morgan , who &apos;s an undergraduate , who &apos;s pledged to give 10 percent of the little amount that she has , and on the right , ada wan , who has worked directly for the poor , but has now gone to yale to do an mba to have more to give .
but if i had to get a match to match , obviously , i would need a different design of a cellphone .
i &apos;ve actually got a website that &apos;s got a bunch of photos that i &apos;ve done of some of the other folks i didn &apos;t get a chance to show you .
the root mechanism of a dragon-king is a slow maturation towards instability , which is the bubble , and the climax of the bubble is often the crash .
stars will orbit the black hole in the very same way that planets orbit the sun .
it &apos;s way more energetic .
and in all these 42 cases , when we kept pushing them back , there was three kinds of reaction .
and the colors here represent the motivation behind the money .
here &apos;s a classic example : rebecca has a benign blood vessel tumor that &apos;s growing out through her skull , has obliterated her nose , and she &apos;s having difficulty seeing .
how might we improve access to safe drinking water for the world &apos;s poorest people , and at the same time stimulate innovation amongst local water providers ?
and just imagine the sense of wonder in a baby when it first discovers that , merely by uttering a sound , it can get objects to move across a room as if by magic , and maybe even into its mouth .
we argue strongly that the people living in the house are simply not the problem .
i suppose it &apos;s there to tell you that somebody &apos;s cleaned the place , and it &apos;s all lovely .
i spoke up a little more at work .
&quot; &quot; this headscarf and these clothes , &quot; &quot; she says , &quot; &quot; give me the freedom to do what i need to do to speak to those whose support and assistance are critical for this work .
and then i thought , &quot; &quot; nah , that wouldn &apos;t be very nice . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) that attitude of only taking what you need was really what everybody had on the network in those days , and in fact , it wasn &apos;t just the people on the network , but it was actually kind of built into the protocols of the internet itself .
so , as we have faced liability , we have stepped back and back , and unfortunately , where there is liability , guess what there is : power .
they had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention .
and so what had happened , really , is that we found ourselves in a perceptual shift .
so we &apos;ve been working with transport for london , and that organization hasn &apos;t actually been responsible as a client for a new bus for 50 years .
i &apos;m going to ask and try to answer , in some ways , kind of an uncomfortable question .
child : um , yeah .
or this poor man who kept his diploma — he went to university of michigan , but he never would talk about his poverty as a youngster , ever — just would not mention it .
an average african country receives foreign aid to the tune of 13 , 15 percent of its gdp , and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources from rich countries to poor countries .
it was bad .
i have a friend in portugal whose grandfather built a vehicle out of a bicycle and a washing machine so he could transport his family .
modern technology is not going to change who we choose to love .
and then when it &apos;s time to go , a green light goes and the jumpmaster goes , &quot; &quot; go . &quot; &quot; the first guy goes , and you &apos;re just in line , and you just kind of lumber to the door .
and that &apos;s a really fascinating thing about this approach .
( applause ) i don &apos;t know if we have any statisticians in the house , but there &apos;s definitely something going on . ( laughter )
it &apos;s mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals .
we &apos;re about to do six in the u.k. next week .
you &apos;ve got the pictures you &apos;ve taken .
they are believed to have magical powers .
maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery .
who knew about extension managers ?
we showed this to the hotel people the other day , and they were terrified and said that nobody would come to the ritz-carlton anymore , because of this fish .
when the shopping center died , the city restored the site &apos;s original wetlands , creating lakefront property , which then attracted private investment , the first private investment to this very low-income neighborhood in over 40 years .
that means we get our new hips for free .
so everyone who came into contact with ella or a family like ella &apos;s would spend 80 percent of their time working with the families and only 20 percent servicing the system .
( applause ) chris anderson : quick question .
they are growing in political clout , as the mullahs are isolating themselves — with the exception of one group of mullahs , who are not well known to americans .
and if you do lavish as much technique as possible , and you try to make the highest quality hamburger , it gets to be a little bit involved .
he &apos;s an amnesic who had , very possibly , the worst memory in the world .
inside the rolls-royce is the queen mother .
so i want to talk about that as an opportunity that we really have failed to engage with very well in this country and , in fact , worldwide .
what &apos;s the regulation of the reserve and what is the regulation of the parks ?
right now that &apos;s all cleared out — this was done about eight months ago — and high-rises are now going up into that central spot .
a billion people , 1 / 6th of the world population .
that &apos;s like comparing the population of the world to the population of los angeles , proportionally speaking .
i &apos;m a sophomore and studying communications , tv and mass media , and basically trying to live life like a normal kid , which i always wanted growing up .
it was a concert he recorded in the shrine auditorium in 1949 .
it was a really wonderful experience , but when i got home , i suddenly felt very disconnected and suddenly shut in and shut out , and i was really surprised by those feelings .
it says a lot about her .
they digest our food , they make our vitamins , they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out .
so it &apos;s important to remember that whether it &apos;s good or it &apos;s bad , &quot; this too shall pass . &quot;
when i was a boy , in front of every house in the summer evenings , you would find young people together singing the songs of the day , or the old songs .
and their love &#91; for studying &#93; was so big that i cried .
you &apos;re just kind of moving around .
technology is just generally being used to allow us to create in as shared and social a way as possible .
you can look at the statistics , the frequency of the occurrence of peak-to-valleys of different sizes , which is represented in this graph .
the basic idea is they aggregate to form large groups , or swarms .
so i asked myself : okay , is this a model for creation , this adaptation that we do ?
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll be content together . &quot; &quot; he never used my nickname again .
now it &apos;s just five times , and soon it will be 2.5 times .
so that keeps me coming back .
and the more time you spend looking at this , the more things you also will see in the clouds .
we are talking about the cradle of democracy .
it &apos;s a composite view that &apos;s constantly changing and being updated .
there &apos;s quite a lot of people that are eating insects .
director 2 : can you not shut up ?
in germany , we are pushing the ratification of the un convention , which is a subsequent convention .
and we have the greatest chance of success if we recognize our vulnerability .
so who are these scientists and engineers at a magical place called darpa ?
let &apos;s see what happens here .
a little background : when my grade five was learning about child rights , they were made to roll incense sticks , agarbattis , for eight hours to experience what it means to be a child laborer .
we can make food more important , not less , and save ourselves by doing so .
it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; are you smarter than a fifth grader ? &quot; &quot; i think we &apos;ve learned the answer to that here .
thank you .
so the hindenburg wasn &apos;t , you know , it was inevitable it was going to go .
and this is a particularly small scooter for a gentleman of this size .
and brian allen was able , in a miraculous flight , to get the gossamer albatross across the english channel , and we won the 100,000-pound , 200,000-dollar prize for that .
any parents out there of teenagers ? all we do is cook for these people — they eat two , three , four dinners a night — it &apos;s ridiculous !
and then he said , &quot; &quot; what you do for the least of these , you do for me . &quot; &quot; now i was pretty psyched .
so the key thing in terms of these new tools that are kind of plumbing the depths of the global brain , that are sending kind of trace dyes through that whole bloodstream — the question is , are you finding out something new ?
and so you wouldn &apos;t sit that close to another person because of your notion that it &apos;s you versus the universe — that &apos;s all buddha discovered .
this turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans .
that first three years , ok , that was just what we couldn &apos;t solve for .
of course , when you digitize , that &apos;s not enough , because these documents , most of them are in latin , in tuscan , in venetian dialect , so you need to transcribe them , to translate them in some cases , to index them , and this is obviously not easy .
and the problem of poor vision , is actually not just a health problem , it &apos;s also an educational problem , and it &apos;s an economic problem , and it &apos;s a quality of life problem .
child : oh my god ! how did you do that ?
that &apos;s not the southwest season .
the majority of the planet , aspiring for development , having the right for development , are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle , a momentous pressure .
giraffes are this desire in the dark . &quot; &quot; this is important .
we &apos;ll start off easy .
our boat was floating like a matchbox on the water without any control .
and the fact that the polar bear and husky or magpie and a bear or you and i and our dogs can crossover and have that experience sets play aside as something separate .
and what you can really think of xml in this case is it &apos;s the packaging that we &apos;re putting around these pages .
as we saw with the teacher in cody , wyoming , she seems to be affected by the law .
so , for example , when you touch a pencil , microbial exchange happens .
you know , i &apos;m a middle class white man . i have no race , no class , no gender .
and now , for the first time , i can do something fun .
for example , i recently wrote an article in the new yorker magazine , but i can &apos;t afford to buy an ad in it .
and what this quantification showed us is that , upon experiencing a train of these air puffs , the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyperactivity which is persistent , long-lasting , and also appears to be graded .
now that argument , i made that argument 30 — oh my god , i don &apos;t want to think about it — more than 30 years ago , but there &apos;s a deeper argument implicit in what i &apos;ve told you , and i want to tell you that argument briefly , and that is , consciousness creates an observer-independent reality .
but there &apos;s a cost to this elegant unification , because years of research have shown that the math of string theory doesn &apos;t quite work .
but the problem is , there &apos;s only so much you can take , and also when you do that operation , your patients might actually have significant pain in that defect site even two years after the operation .
and people who live in cities in the developed world tend to be very prosperous , and thus use a lot of stuff .

a recent report by the pew center on trends in america indicates that only 10 percent of young adults under the age of 30 &quot; place a lot of trust in the media . &quot;
it helped us exaggerate what we were afraid of , and we seek causality where there is none , and we then get an illusion of confidence where we believe that we are the best car drivers , above the average .
but there are still over 650 million indians , pakistanis , sri lankans , bangladeshis , nepalese , who remain washed up on the shores of poverty .
nothing to worry about , right ?
and i wouldn &apos;t say that is the wrong thing in all circumstances .
she could have called her my friend , or my &quot; &quot; friend , &quot; &quot; or my &quot; &quot; special friend &quot; &quot; — ( laughter ) — or even worse , just not asked at all .
or should they be given an alternative standard of care , such as the best current treatment available in the country in which the research is being conducted ?
what was also clear was that people really wanted to know a lot more about how the technology would look and feel , and that there was really much more interest in this than we had ever thought possible .
so we take this just completely for granted .
of course , it &apos;s not all about food ; it &apos;s also about kids getting exercise .
i &apos;m a copy editor .
so here &apos;s an object , and in this case , it &apos;s a wire figure in the shape of a human , and we &apos;re going to film that object with just a regular camera .
so , i always tell my students , &quot; work smart , then work hard . &quot;
in fact , she indicated that if we would do that , not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude from the members of the extended family , but she said , &quot; &quot; even god will smile , and when god smiles , there is peace , and justice , and joy . &quot; &quot; so , at the table at 915 , i learned something about compassion .
and so our project is seeking to look at this readout , understanding which of these 25,000 genes is turned on .
sweet — energy .
crucially , asperger viewed autism as a diverse continuum that spans an astonishing range of giftedness and disability .
so when we want to learn whether a planet is habitable , whether it might be amenable to life , we want to know not only how much total light it receives and how warm it is , but we want to know about its space weather — this high-energy radiation , the uv and the x-rays that are created by its star and that bathe it in this bath of high-energy radiation .
it &apos;s one of those things , we got by just fine before we had to do any of those .
then you look at the phenomenon of kogi .
on one hand , on the left bank of the river , are the people like me who study those planets and try to define the environments .
and then we &apos;ll put on a satellite tag that will give us the long-distance journeys with the light-based geolocation algorithms solved on the computer that &apos;s on the fish .
very much in the same way , it &apos;s very difficult to see astronomical sources , because of the atmosphere that &apos;s continuously moving by .
i mean , if i got to go to tedx usc my life wouldn &apos;t suck . but i don &apos;t . so it does . &quot; &quot; if that &apos;s how you talked , imagine what kind of work would get done .
however , what i have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music .
on the left side , you see the yield produced using conventional agriculture , with a 100 percent phosphorus dose .
further to the right is more .
and because of that , then a lot of singers started saying , &quot; all right , what &apos;s virtual choir 2.0 ? &quot;
and they were interested in developing a new , alternative art space , and they needed funding for it , so they decided to come up with some interesting fundraising projects .
musician and natural soundscape expert bernie krause describes how a healthy environment has animals and insects taking up low , medium and high-frequency bands , in exactly the same way as a symphony does .
of course , you can &apos;t copy and paste education systems wholesale , but these comparisons have identified a range of factors that high-performing systems share .
girls were prohibited from going to school .
now to the funds we raise , and research , and how we &apos;re redefining research .
and i &apos;ve got to tell you , what i found out in the world in four different continents , was depressingly familiar .
the u.s. is actually becoming a bit of a leader in kind of enlightened urban planning and renewal , and i want to single out a place like chicago , where i look at some guy like mayor daley as a bit of a design hero for being able to work through the political processes and all that to improve an area .
this leads me to the second thing that you would learn in your 30-minute exploration of drug violence in mexico .
it kind of makes you wonder about our own time .
everything started breaking .
whereas the film yesterday that we saw of the simulation of the inside of a cell , as a former molecular biologist , i didn &apos;t like that at all .
and that &apos;s what we do to all traffic survivors .
dare i admit that after she did it i never really loved her again ?
and in the context of particular courses , you can ask questions like , what are some of the misconceptions that are more common and how do we help students fix them ?
french parents were more likely to say things like , &quot; &quot; noah was here for so little time , but he taught us so much .
it &apos;s actually not very hard . ninety-eight percent of cases , this is a piece of cake .
when something changes , what happens to those properties ?
the present always contains the past .
but actually these , like i said , are still the actual prototype .
compared to your regular friends , they are boring and dull , right ? because in this new context , the comparison is very , very different . in fact , you find yourself disliking them enough almost to qualify for french citizenship .
so a kid who &apos;s 14 in high school gets this version of the pythagorean theorem , which is a truly subtle and interesting proof , but in fact it &apos;s not a good way to start learning about mathematics .
a few years ago , the number of babies dying in their first year of life in the world fell by five percent in just one year .
but i quite love the way it &apos;s posed .
and we did actually start calling ourselves martians .
that &apos;s how wally got hired .
and that chain link is really expensive .
but abed did not slow , and on that xeroxed piece of paper , my neck again broke , and again , i was left without anger .
&#91; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &#93; orange , good . &#91; &quot; &quot; table &quot; &quot; &#93; green .
many scientists can now grow many different types of cells .
and the women are diligent . they are focused ; they work hard .
which group loses the most weight , we give them prizes .
and , as you can see , the death rate goes down from 65,000 deaths per conflict per year in the 1950s to less than 2,000 deaths per conflict per year in this decade , as horrific as it is .
we tended gardens , we became interested in organic food , we knew or we were vegetarians .
( laughter ) my father taught me how to walk when i was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking .
it has no consciousness .
and we take the nerve away from your chest muscle and let these nerves grow into it .
so he taught me that physics is cool because it teaches us so much about the world around us .
and then , again , the building itself , middle of los angeles , right across from city hall .
it &apos;s as big as any of the biggest trees east of the mississippi river , and yet it &apos;s only a minor feature on chronos .
and there &apos;s the sheep .
this is not some game of thrones empire-level set of questions .
to our knowledge they had no music .
as you know , we are very interested in humanoid robot , human walking , so we decided to build a small humanoid robot .
build it from scratch proposed that it was time for a whole new system .
and these preservatives had been found in breast cancer tumors .
the purpose of these images is to inspire you , to motivate you , so that we can look at them and think , &quot; &quot; well , however bad my life is , it could be worse .
one of the things that happened right around world war ii in that same time period before , and as sure as hell afterwards , government got — realized that scientists aren &apos;t strange dudes that , you know , hide in ivory towers and do ridiculous things with test tube .
what about athens ? mediterranean climate , but in the sun it was not comfortable . they didn &apos;t perceive comfort .
thank you so much .
they &apos;re healthy ; they &apos;re clean — it &apos;s amazing .
china burns half the world &apos;s coal each year , and that &apos;s why , it is a key reason why , it is the world &apos;s largest emitter of greenhouse gases .
i think a lot of families are fractured by unrealistic expectations that are based upon this false vision of human sexuality .
it was like the waiting room in the doctor &apos;s office .
very recently , with collaborators , we studied a dynamical system where you see the dragon-king as these big loops and we were able to apply tiny perturbations at the right times that removed , when control is on , these dragons .
and over the last two years , 2,000 people has been crippled in the southern tip of bandundu region .
so i classify the people into three : uneducated , little educated , surplus educated .
but at the same time it was also impossible not to see the human vitality , the aspiration and the ambition of the people who live there : women washing their babies , washing their clothes , hanging them out to dry .
i study ants , and that &apos;s because i like to think about how organizations work .
rw : do you want me to hold you or not ? dh : don &apos;t hold me that hard .
just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property — no flower was damaged in the process of this shot ; it was just attached to the tripod , not killed — then under ultraviolet light , look at that .
some will be down to two or three .
not very well , it turns out . i can &apos;t do that .
and so if you ask this question : where would you look to see the future of education ?
and i want to take a moment to honor these house republicans — ( applause ) who had the courage last fall to step out and take a political risk , by telling the truth about the climate crisis .
by the time i left , we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars . and as we speak now , we have about 40 billion dollars in reserves due to proper management of our finances .
it can get sideways like a rally car driver , always able to take the tightest curve , even on slippery , changing surfaces , never spinning out .
it was vital in the transition , but what fascinated me was , in the transition to what ? what could actually work ?
very , very simple .
we will know that we &apos;re not that miracle , right , that we &apos;re just another duck in a row , we &apos;re not the only kids on the block , and i think that that &apos;s philosophically a very profound thing to learn .
if we do that , we not only get the jobs , we get the improvements in public infrastructure , the restoration of public infrastructure .
but seriously , would anyone like to choose a piece ?
so that leaves a couple of places like iran , maybe venezuela , that you would like to have very close surveillance of anything that goes on with fissile stuff .
( applause ) and in the first year , i had to fire half of the men .
so part of our understanding of this was given to us by ludwig boltzmann , an austrian physicist in the 19th century .

and i look at , on your show , actually , i kind of lost my voice , and i haven &apos;t gotten it back .
he &apos;s obviously not joanne — so we &apos;ll &quot; &quot; add user . &quot; &quot; evan . okay .

so , there &apos;s all kinds of bacteria on the earth that have no business being in you or on you at any time , and if they are , they make you incredibly sick .
another thing it &apos;s good for is navigation — it can guide you around in a city .
so , the way of treating these diseases in early times was to , in some way or other , exorcise those evil spirits , and this is still going on , as you know .
this is based on an f. scott fitzgerald short story .
the president dismissed the secretary of state , whom he was conferring with , and asked the dentist if he would remove a tooth .
so we collect this mr.
so , but i think whether you own your own company or you &apos;re just starting out like me , like something like this is so vital for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning .
and my , then , five year-old daughter was helping me in the way that five year-olds do .
but if i think about it , i thought i wanted a husband , but what i really wanted was a family that was loving . and i fiercely love my children , and they love me back . &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; i thought that i wanted to be a doctor , but what i really wanted to be was somebody who served and healed and cured .
so what we can do , again , using spatiotemporal features , we looked at every shot .
but there is not a day that goes by where i am not so grateful to be married to this man ; where i &apos;m not so grateful for the possibility of changing minds , and rewarding conversations , and creating a world where love belongs to us all .
so , that &apos;s a challenge , not just for organs but also for tissues .
a couple months later , news of this proposal got leaked to the press and now there are thousands of articles , over 10,000 articles , on this star alone .

the twist is that one player , on the left , is informed about how much on each trial there is .
i remember one night when someone phoned me on my cellphone — ordinary person who i don &apos;t know — from tahrir square .
it was in constant flux , and we had to , rather than fight it , embrace it , see where the milk would take us and compensate to make it even better .
actually , you have to put a circle around that , and call it business .
sometimes you can make some horrible choices with them .
and i think this is partly where there is such a divide of opinion , that there &apos;s a lot of people in this room and around the world who think very differently about the internet .
learning the information that has accumulated over time and reading the message left by my ancestors were better than any consolation therapy or piece of advice any living adults could give me .
there were 8,000 kinds of notes in america .
if every commercially minded cosmetic surgeon were tied end to end along a railroad track , that would be me , stoking the train without a qualm in the world .

fireworms scrawl white lines as they feed .
they sort of say the harsh news , that we are facing the largest transformative development since the industrialization .

these countries took those strategies i just showed you ; the community engagement , the case finding , contact tracing , etc . , and they turned them on their head .
had something gotten in his wound that killed him ?
does anyone here know the company multi-health systems ?
so really , just an amazing image , slowed down extremely , to extremely slow speeds .
so this is important .
second of all , we should really strive to use far less energy in creating these materials .
charles used to say , &quot; &quot; the extent to which you have a design style is the extent to which you have not solved the design problem . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s kind of a brutal quote .
the reality , unfortunately , is a little different , and it has a lot to do with trust , or a lack of it .
they &apos;re already the largest trading nation , already the largest exporting nation , already the largest manufacturing nation , and they &apos;re also the biggest emitters of carbon in the world .
the way we expect the world to be changes the way we see it .
i ordered them ; they came by fedex .

it &apos;s opt-in . you might even get texas and south carolina , who didn &apos;t opt into the education race to the top , you might even get them to opt in . why ?
dr. samuel cartwright graduated from the university of pennsylvania medical school .

i learned new characters every day during the course of the next 15 years .
and this is where i have to query all of you .
and finally , lots of people are saying that yemen &apos;s revolution is going to break the country .
it pays for itself within one year .

and that little square in the corner , a naught .7 percent , that &apos;s the amount we &apos;re actually aware of .
i &apos;ve got a question for randi .
you end up isolated if you don &apos;t cultivate the capacity for solitude , the ability to be separate , to gather yourself .

the us defense department has long warned of consequences from the climate crisis , including refugees , food and water shortages and pandemic disease .
it is not a sprint .
now , what we need is , we need people who will be able to scale them up .

and remember , paths crossed in 1984 , and more and more women were dying of cardiovascular disease .
so he asked me , could he please visit me , and then finally he did , and explained to me that what i did now in my shop was an anachronism , that the industrial revolution had broken out , and that i rather should join the factory .
this is fourier &apos;s law of heat conduction .
and no two people could disagree about what the word free was and what the word falafel was , behind us , &quot; &quot; free falafel . &quot; &quot; you know .
so we &apos;re talking about an investment that in terms of impacts on the state economy is not going to really pay off for 15 or 20 years , and of course america is notorious for being a short term-oriented society .
i felt so incredibly grateful for my life .
so that being said , it &apos;s highly unlikely that any jellyfish would survive that long in the wild .
we talked to pharmaceutical companies .
can i do that one again ?
it must be a machine . &quot; &quot; so i says , &quot; &quot; ok then , if you say it &apos;s a machine ... &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) ( applause ) that one took me approximately six weeks . ( applause )
a chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters .
we found remains of giant predatory dinosaurs , medium-sized predatory dinosaurs , and seven or eight different kinds of crocodile-like hunters .

additionally , these sort of edenic places are often distant from where people live .
iraq will still be the second largest oil producer in the world , behind saudi arabia .
and , you see , this era coincided with my own childhood .
i believe that these tools that worked in these 42 pilot cases can be consolidated in standard processes in a bpo kind of environment , and made available on web , call-center and franchise physical offices , for a fee , to serve anyone confronted with a demand for a bribe .
( laughter ) now , i &apos;m convinced a lot of you probably share my passions , especially my passion for &quot; &quot; judge judy , &quot; &quot; and you &apos;d fight anybody who attempted to take her away from us , but i &apos;m a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life , a passion for the live professional performing arts , performing arts that represent the orchestral repertoire , yes , but jazz as well , modern dance , opera , theater and more and more and more .
first of all , we wanted small schools — about 300 , 400 pupils — 14 to 19 year-olds , and critically , about 80 percent of the curriculum done not through sitting in classrooms , but through real-life , practical projects , working on commission to businesses , ngo &apos;s and others .
and therefore , it &apos;s not a matter of opinion .
i believe in you .
that &apos;s the challenge . okay , so , now , what we — in the journey of wheat , let &apos;s go back and look at these 12 stages .
so this is target , the company .
this cooperative ability has interesting implications for economic planning and a variety of other fields .
that &apos;s my daughter and me .

more than 700 of these boats , which are fishermen boats repurposed with oil absorbent in white and oil containment in orange , were used , but they only collected three percent of the oil on the surface , and the health of the cleaners were very deeply affected .
and when we did , my dad would say , &quot; &quot; can you believe someone climbed a tree over there , picked this thing off it , put it in a truck , drove it all the way to the docks and then sailed it all the way across the atlantic ocean and then put it in another truck and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house , so they could sell it to us for 25 cents ? &quot; &quot; and i &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t believe that . &quot; &quot; and he &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t believe it either .
for two straight days , the city became an open battlefield between the federal forces and a well-organized group , presumably from the local criminal organization , la familia michoacana , or the michoacán family .
thank you .
the breaks got fewer and fewer .
nowadays , there are computational systems that can suss out emotional states and even lying from processing human faces .
well , we haven &apos;t done that , so we can &apos;t really expect to find an answer when we &apos;re still afraid of the question .
( applause ) the coolest thing about this — and this is what &apos;s completing the whole circle — is that in april of this year , at the geffen moca in downtown los angeles , there &apos;s going to be an exhibition called &quot; &quot; art of the streets . &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; art of the streets &quot; &quot; is going to have pretty much the bad-asses of the street art scene — banksy , shepard fairey , kaws — all of these guys will be there .
i &apos;m going to start with glenn gould .
so here are the graphs you &apos;ve seen lots of times before .
( laughter ) ( applause ) when we looked at the data , and we met with the staff , there were many excuses for why strawberry mansion was low-performing and persistently dangerous .
sort of eavesdrop on the activity of nerve cells in the brain .
this is a point cloud .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s nice about emotion .
the data came back from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and it was all the same : no correlation , no connection , none at all .

is there a place for me in the world out there ?
it was not going to work , so i decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had , at least some of them , had to also be moved through a hole that we could open up again in that wall and begin feeding the appropriate nonhuman animals through that hole onto the other side of being legal persons .
and an hour or two later , if i saw her , she &apos;d come over to me and she &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; bryan , do you still feel me hugging you ? &quot; &quot; and if i said , &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; she &apos;d assault me again , and if i said , &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; she &apos;d leave me alone .

but other countries in europe , notably the nordic countries , are showing that it &apos;s possible to have a kick-ass economy without being a workaholic .
it would mean that , even before birth , mothers are warning their children that it &apos;s a wild world out there , telling them , &quot; &quot; be careful . &quot; &quot; let me be clear .
i &apos;m half egyptian , and i &apos;m muslim .
there &apos;s still 13 trillion dollars circulating in the u.s. economy .
and i think , actually , that &apos;s already really happening .
let me show you this .
but also — and this is so important — to communicate their despair , to say , &quot; &quot; we &apos;ve tried this and it doesn &apos;t work , and what shall we do ? &quot; &quot; and then , lo and behold , there &apos;s another group answering these kids who may be in america , or maybe this is a group in israel , saying , &quot; &quot; yeah , you did it a little bit wrong . this is how you should do it . &quot; &quot; the philosophy is very simple .
here is not like anywhere else .
here it comes at you in real speed . you &apos;ll hear this .
and that creates a big problem .
we said , all right , let &apos;s , you know , throw so problems at holly , see if she messes these things up .
as we speak , there are 117 or so clinical trials researching the use of stem cells for liver diseases .
and also you can see the water is brown , the mud is brown and oil is brown , so when everything is mixed up , it &apos;s really hard to see what &apos;s in the water .
95 percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking , and that &apos;s because the precipitation patterns and the temperature patterns are changing .
in other words , you &apos;re certainly fast-forwarding this whole process of a billion people going to prosperity .
that makes me furious .
and i promise to you , this was such an important moment in my career , when i realized that the great leader believed in young people and new ideas .
measurement is the lifeblood of science and progress .
they undertook a study of autism prevalence in the general population .
yes , it &apos;s a little boring , but some people kind of get into the zen of it .
since 2001 , we &apos;ve interviewed hundreds of thousands of people — young and old , men and women , educated and illiterate .
so i decided to build a prototype .
and it &apos;s truly awesome and wondrous .
finished university education , got a medical degree , 1986 .
no magic . no secret . it &apos;s just love .
they &apos;re disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well .
and i faced a whole new set of challenges .
and further , he found a similar response in more or less the same location in 10 out of 12 subjects .
but , you know — is this actually dramatically changing love ?
a self-organizing system is one where a structure appears without explicit intervention from the outside .
they began as very local and specific .
he could not probably give the right kind of love for you , but for us , he has given the people the right kind of love , that is important .
tie game with five seconds left .
and mike , who i met at galapagos , a trip which i won at ted , is leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling his journey through cancer .
it &apos;s much more easy to build hybrids .
this is actually a disservice , because whales are ecosystem engineers .
( applause ) bruno giussani : yuval , you have a new book out .
in the sars epidemic , we learned in hong kong that most of transmission was because people were removing their masks improperly .
progress happens when all the factors that make for it are ready and then it is inevitable . &quot; &quot; 2007 . the iphone makes it debut .
it is displaying data that exists already in a different way , to amplify it , to provide cues to the doctors , to the nurses , so they can see what &apos;s happening .
and i think this is one level deeper , and it &apos;s actually a requirement for changing your perspective .
our goal , quite simply , is that every single judge in the united states will use a data-driven risk tool within the next five years .
&quot; okay , &quot; i thought , &quot; here &apos;s a first world country , let &apos;s see what they can do . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a speleologist , that means a cave explorer .
this is not james , this is one of the kids that he works with .
and in short order , the cooperators are done for .
thank you .
we &apos;ve tried various approaches , paring it down to minimal components .
it &apos;s a vast , impersonal , uncaring force of nature that is not affected by our wishes or desires .
so what if there were not only an internet of information , what if there were an internet of value — some kind of vast , global , distributed ledger running on millions of computers and available to everybody .
it &apos;s almost 80 million years old .
and the first of these is to connect , is that your social relationships are the most important cornerstones of your life .
now , if we take a step back and think about these other two really important advantages : one is improved immune responses through delivery , and the second is getting rid of the cold chain .
so i looked , and like the thousands of people that had tried before , i found nothing .
and to me , this is research misconduct .
but the key thing here is , what do you think should be in the new goals ?
alejandro aravena : i don &apos;t know if you were able to read the subtitles , but you can tell from the body language that participatory design is not a hippie , romantic , let &apos;s-all-dream-together-about- the-future-of-the-city kind of thing .
so i think in the next decade , the sciences and the humanities will come closer together to be able to answer deep questions about mankind .
be prepared to find vocations that make you useful to your neighbors and to your fellow citizens .
and that disparity struck me as this incredible intellectual and moral puzzle .
i &apos;m not here to make an indictment of democracy .
well the moon is casting a shadow down on the earth .
and — ( laughter ) they — they &apos;re invented around the same time . i think beer came first .
the chimps are playing better than the humans , better in the sense of adhering to game theory .
despite implicit and explicit questions of my right to be in an elite space , i &apos;m proud to report that when i graduated , i was the first black woman to earn a phd in astrophysics in yale &apos;s then 312-year history .
( laughter ) that &apos;s good , wake up , wake up , wake up .
in 2016 , it is the dimension of our being itself that cries out for its fair share of our imagination .
i &apos;m sick to death of this old cell phone .
they &apos;ve all defined the terms on which they will accept bookings .
what if there isn &apos;t enough clean air and fresh water ?
the doha tribeca film festival was held at our new cultural hub , katara .
how did hippomenes beat her ?
i made the front page of my hometown paper that i delivered for six years , you know ?
and then from hour to hour we rot and rot .
ms : and just like that , one by one , all of these companies suddenly disappeared .
it was my version of my grandfather &apos;s hours of the day alone in his library .
she organized a tedx action out there and made all the unseen faces of the city on the walls in her town .
the one thing we need to do is we have to replace these inefficient incandescent light bulbs , florescent lights , with this new technology of led , led light bulbs .
as you can see , one of our parties , you know , a few years ago .
so this past spring , as i was gearing up to begin writing a biography of muhammad , i realized i needed to read the koran properly — as properly as i could , that is .
it &apos;s more than that ; it &apos;s deeper .
here &apos;s what we do .
they explored the keyboard . they played around with it .
no knock on the neuroscientists .
now , put them on both cups .
this shapes how we think about our health , our relationships , how we decide how to vote , what we consider fair or ethical .
in 2005 , the egyptian stock exchange returned over 145 percent .
these electrodes act like mini pacemakers to get the cells to contract in the lab .
the men knew that the nearest islands they could reach were the marquesas islands , 1,200 miles away .
you &apos;re not from kenya .
and you even find a church .
by the way , dsl is a kludge .
and it really works to start with them .
and then they strike out across the ocean , down to kenya .
their behavior in terms of the underlying changes that are going on in their brain .
i drew it during the few hours of electricity we get .
many people in mexico are afraid today .
so the data has since been used by groups like human rights watch on its recent report on these types of sting operations .
there is a decent contribution to happiness from the genes — about 50 percent — but there is still that 50 percent that is unaccounted for .
the third thing is again cities .
how about we do this whole hill now ?
( laughter ) well , bob russell was telling us about his work on nanotubes in his research at the microscopic level .
the mission is not yet complete .
why is it that somebody might literally see the glass as half full , and somebody literally sees it as half empty ?
that &apos;s what the surgeon is saying in the operating room when the patient &apos;s on the table .
my opinion is that the mossad is involved , but that the leading force is not israel .
our hospitals have an explicit policy called age-based allocation of healthcare resources .
they are inaccessible to our senses but can be seen through mathematical lenses .
&quot; no , no , what you talking about ? &quot;
as she recounts : &quot; &quot; on the third day of creation , god commands the earth to grow a fruit-bearing fruit tree . &quot; &quot; for this first fruit tree , there was to be no differentiation between trunk , branches , leaves and fruit .
so how does it happen ?
and i think that &apos;s how we got to become human .
so , this talk is going to be about how do we make things and what are the new ways that we &apos;re going to make things in the future .
and what you &apos;re looking at is a paper form in the hand of a ministry of health nurse in indonesia , who is tramping out across the countryside in indonesia on , i &apos;m sure , a very hot and humid day , and she is going to be knocking on thousands of doors over a period of weeks or months , knocking on the doors and saying , &quot; &quot; excuse me , we &apos;d like to ask you some questions .
it &apos;s not a purely visual technology .
an important key insight that we learned about meetings is that people pack them in one after another , disruptive to the day .
it was like it was yesterday .
( laughter ) so , we &apos;re looking at the same criteria as most people — you know , can i afford it ?
and when the kindergarten kids recently moved their gate , they found out the fence was made out of tapioca .
and it &apos;s kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse , except that you &apos;re now running a string of these things down .
it was invented by russell smith , a passionate inventor in new zealand who was trying to help blind people .
and here we find that we can use these systems to test the application of this technology in particular tissues , for example , figuring out how to deliver the crispr tool into cells .
it was kind of along these lines , and the allegation was that i have , quote , &quot; &quot; affection for terrorists . &quot; &quot; now , the good news is that the person who said it was ann coulter .
they exist only to foster fear and promote transphobia .
we experimented on ourselves .
nothing that you would call architecture , right ?
this is how we landed for the most important meeting of the world &apos;s leaders in china .
and we have taken pictures like this .
it &apos;s like a rodeo show . they all get a ride on the machine , and they get rewarded for how fast or how far they can make the machine move forward .
they decided that wasn &apos;t good enough , so they went to india and studied the indian state of kerala that also had a system like this , and they adapted it for ethiopia .
and that &apos;s retirement homes on the west coast of florida .
it would have taken the three of them a very long time , especially given that none of them are actually from honolulu .
so i decided to contact you myself , for you to assure me of safety and honesty , if i have to entrust any amount of money under your custody .
he was 20-some years older than anybody else in the sample .
a metaphor will serve here : where elite mathematicians and statisticians and theorists often serve as architects in the expanding realm of science , the remaining large majority of basic applied scientists , including a large portion of those who could be said to be of the first rank , are the ones who map the terrain , they scout the frontiers , they cut the pathways , they raise the buildings along the way .
so we have this field of science that &apos;s all about slime , and color changes . check this out .
it &apos;s making a little bit fun of getting older , and , you know , people might like it .
late pick-ups went up every week for the next four weeks until they topped out at triple the pre-fine average , and then they fluctuated at between double and triple the pre-fine average for the life of the fine .
but kund , which uses the gypsum belt , for that you have to go back to your calendar , three million years ago .
i want to close with just two points .
we have more and more time-saving devices , but sometimes , it seems , less and less time .

this man , joel salatin , they call him a lunatic farmer because he grows against the system .
♫ and the sum of invisible power ♫ ♫ had a name . ♫ ♫ it &apos;s the same name . ♫ ♫ tembererana , hey , tembererana ... ♫ ♫ da , da , da , da , da , da , da ♫ ♫ tembere , tembere , tembere , tembererana ♫ ♫ tembere , tembere , tembere , tembererana , hey ♫ ♫ tembererana , hey ♫ ♫ tembererana ... ♫ ( applause )
and right beyond the historic bridge that you can see here , right next to the plaza , you can see that the river looked like a river of trash .
here &apos;s another group .
a professional psychic who speaks to dead people , she can &apos;t reach me ?
even when you &apos;re standing in front of a megaphone , it &apos;s pretty much every direction .
and we &apos;ve been getting a lot of takers . one is the rock &apos; n &apos; rollers .
we also have a classroom hives project , where — this is a nonprofit venture — we &apos;re spreading the word around the world for how honeybee hives can be taken into the classroom or into the museum setting , behind glass , and used as an educational tool .
in the united states , efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population .
and if you look at these figures for the more developed markets like u.k. , germany , and so on , they &apos;re actually much lower .
they were both only children who chose not to have kids .
that &apos;s 38 stories tall .
thanks very much .
this probably is : the aral sea .
when i made it to the halfway mark , at eight minutes , i was 100 percent certain that i was not going to be able to make this .
so i &apos;m going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas .
and those who do , on average , wait 11 months to make the report .
two weeks later , the police stopped them .
and gould &apos;s specialty was playing bach .
and that &apos;s why , next month in morocco , a meeting is taking place between all the countries .
is agriculture adapted to that ?
it doesn &apos;t make them good people , but it &apos;s at the heart of engineering , at the heart of a creative community , an innovative community , and the open source community , the basic ethos of it is , take what other people do , make it better , give it back so we all rise further .
but just because a system is sick doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s dying .
yet , no amount of diplomacy or institutional design can make up for local failures and the consequences that they have .
you can say a person is lying .
and why this is so important is that we now have grown a generation , maybe two , of kids where one out of every four meals is eaten in fast food , one of every four meals is eaten in a car and one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a tv or computer .
now , if you think about democracy from this perspective , a new pluralistic notion of democracy would be one that recognizes that there are many different interests , many different agendas , many different individuals , many different points of view .
and at my feet was the great , still blue plate of the pacific ocean .
the phones were there . but the expectation was once you moved in there your commitment was fully to the task at hand , fully to the people around you .
you do it again and again .
we don &apos;t have to like each other — and sometimes we really don &apos;t like each other .
kids made hamburger cards that were made out of construction paper .
that &apos;s another contradiction — science and art don &apos;t often go together , but interweaving them can help these girls bring their whole selves to what they learn , and maybe one day join the ranks of astronomers who are full of contradictions , and use their backgrounds to discover , once and for all , that we are truly not alone in the universe .
a maybe that could take the form of a gas or a liquid .
it &apos;s actually pretty busy .
so instead of going to coffee meetings or fluorescent-lit conference room meetings , i ask people to go on a walking meeting , to the tune of 20 to 30 miles a week .
what &apos;s going to happen over time with that ?
( laughter ) that &apos;s why the mascot of internet engineering , if it had one , is said to be the bumblebee .
and following that basic idea of the village , we changed it as we got into it .
pucker up big and lean in just a little bit , okay ?
now , if the dna sequences match , they &apos;ll stick together , and so we can look at spots .
so we &apos;ve teamed up with the decoder of the human genome , craig venter , and the company he founded with peter diamandis , the founder of the x prize , to genetically modify the pig genome so that the pig &apos;s organs will not be rejected by the human body and thereby to create an unlimited supply of transplantable organs .
that &apos;s pretty clearly not a good thing .
w1 : they suck .
so there is a lot of emotional communication that happens there .
but a few made it anyway , despite our best efforts , and now it &apos;s time for us to thank them for the work they did and give them every chance they have to raise the coral reefs of the future , their coral babies .
and , even more importantly , since this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture , we can shoot emily in just part of an afternoon , in many different facial poses and facial expressions .
one is that you and i all have between 30 to 50,000 chemicals in our bodies that our grandparents didn &apos;t have .
there are many questions i could not understand , and there are some questions i did not want to understand .
sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise , once clockwise and peck the key twice .
we have the human systems of how we communicate and interrelate and have our whole constructed society , we have the industrial systems , which is essentially the entire economy , and then all of that has to operate within the biggest system , and , i would argue , the most important , the ecosystem .
i wrote him back and said ...
we had a president , moi , who was a dictator .
i &apos;ve pirated the term system d from the former french colonies .
you see , there &apos;s a lot of things we just don &apos;t have data on .
and so i realized it was o.k. to go .
these are the kind of , you know , scenes that you remember and expect from &quot; &quot; jaws . &quot; &quot; and she &apos;s being eaten ; there &apos;s a shark .
and i &apos;d been to russia several times under the communists , and they &apos;d given me marvelous freedom that i didn &apos;t expect .
and that &apos;s a terrifying factor — when you start something and it turns that way — because it means that all that &apos;s left for you is to go back and to find out what the next thing is that you can push , that you can invent , that you can be ignorant about , that you can be arrogant about , that you can fail with , and that you can be a fool with .
so far we &apos;re taking the one , or up to five kilograms of output .
it &apos;s about how our brain is tricked into seeing a persistence of vision that creates a motion picture , and one of the things i had to do is , we — sasha baron cohen is a very clever , very smart guy , comedian , wanted to basically do an homage to the kind of the buster keaton sort of slapstick things , and he wanted his leg brace to get caught on a moving train .
okay , so you can see here the spot .
look at the industry for self-image and the jobs it creates , the revenue it turns over .
when we put people under a lamp for the equivalent of about 30 minutes of sunshine in summer in edinburgh , what we produced was , we produced a rise in circulating nitric oxide .
and so they needed to be able to quickly transform between different theater organizations , and for operational budget reasons , this actually no longer happens in pretty much any multi-form theater in the united states , so we needed to figure out a way to overcome that .
let &apos;s take a closer look in the united states .
you know what i &apos;m saying , just stand up there and answer some random questions ?
they came to detroit for a better way of life .
we used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts .
and they also , of course , had to get people to accept these so-called assets and pay money for them even though they were highly vulnerable .
your intuition might tell you that too .
and you &apos;re seeing a lot of things passing through its minds , a lot of self-models that try to explain the relationship between actuation and sensing . it then tries to do a second action that creates the most disagreement among predictions of these alternative models , like a scientist in a lab . then it does that and tries to explain that , and prune out its self-models .
we know that on mars and the moon there are tons of these structures .
to the trained eye , you can look at the roofs of these malocas , these longhouses , and see that there &apos;s cultural diversity .
she goes away with stars in her eyes about india , as a result .
we do exactly nothing to them until they &apos;re already two years old .
thank you .
so , what people were saying to me about the cause of cancer , sources of cancer , or , for that matter , why you are who you are , didn &apos;t make sense .
the final thing is , again just to reiterate that there &apos;s this practical part , and so we &apos;ve made these anti-quorum sensing molecules that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics .
so just because paper was invented before computers , it doesn &apos;t necessarily mean you get more to the basics of the subject by using paper instead of a computer to teach mathematics .
and when the great big parachute opened , we knew that if it didn &apos;t open there &apos;s a second parachute , and it runs on a nice little clockwork mechanism .
and the truth be told , this is it , isn &apos;t it ?
imagine somewhere in the world : mumbai , beijing , new york , london .
when i moved to harare in 1985 , social justice was at the core of zimbabwe &apos;s national health policy .
when researchers ask heroin addicts what &apos;s the toughest drug to quit , most say cigarettes .
we can &apos;t . what &apos;s great about the agile system is you build in a system of change so that you can react to what &apos;s happening to you in real time .
na : on twitter also .
very few people want to talk about death , and even fewer about children &apos;s death .
so what happens when a person gets a retinal degenerative disease like macular degeneration ? what happens is is that , the front-end cells die , the photoreceptors die , and over time , all the cells and the circuits that are connected to them , they die too .
so this is going to be a crash where they &apos;re going to slam this thing forward into a wall at 30 miles an hour , and see what happens . ok ?
so , climate change is not a new thing .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
the blood veins in our hands echoed a course of water traces on the earth .
we tend to think of business strategy as being a rather abstract body of essentially economic thought , perhaps rather timeless .
i was able to do more things .
and these older people come up to me now and they say , &quot; &quot; mr. stevenson , you give talks , you make speeches , you tell people to stop saying we &apos;re dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation &apos;s history after 9 / 11 . &quot; &quot; they tell me to say , &quot; &quot; no , tell them that we grew up with that . &quot; &quot; and that era of terrorism , of course , was followed by segregation and decades of racial subordination and apartheid .
and the thing that the ordinary afghan is most concerned with is — clare lockhart is here , so i &apos;ll recite a discussion she had with an illiterate woman in northern afghanistan .
as a scientist , i &apos;ve been a crew commander for a nasa mars simulation last year , and as an artist , i create multicultural community art all over the planet .
former guests from around the world had seen that the riots were happening just down the street , and wanted to check if he needed anything .
and suddenly everything looked different .
and fence line was amazing in itself .
but the distances on the universe are so large and the time scales are so large that it takes a long time for this to form .
and for handicapped , they can use this as a normal system .
( laughter ) you were born in new haven , connecticut .
here &apos;s how i think about it : sexting is like leaving your wallet at your boyfriend &apos;s house .
the economies of the future depend on that .
i just joined the points .
when i talk to people who didn &apos;t know me before the shootings , i have three challenges to meet .
so there &apos;s a pretty big gap there .
but in order for you to not just understand how this system works , but to also get personally connected to it , i decided to break the story down into several different narratives .
and the first automation wave in the 1970s .
we can &apos;t do that anymore .
for the first time , you &apos;ll have actors that really feel very interactive , that have real bodies that really react .
if the wind blows them over , they &apos;re like beetles stuck there on the ground .
and every citizen should be able to download an app that shows the population of drones and autonomous vehicles moving through public spaces around them , both right now and historically .
it &apos;s cold , it &apos;s eerie , it &apos;s misty , it might be raining , and you might be standing on the shores of lake michigan brimming with paint thinner . ( laughter ) that is the view that we had of the surface of titan before we got there with cassini , and i can tell you that what we have found on titan , though it is not the same in detail , is every bit as fascinating as that story is .
watch the animal .
the next day , the market started to change regime , course .
they have taught me a lot , and i &apos;d like to be able to share some of these observations with you .
to play a game in those days you had to have an imagination to believe that you were really playing &quot; &quot; battlestar galactica . &quot; &quot; the graphics were just horrible .
unknown in the west , this was the collected wisdom of an entire continent , the voice of africa at a time when africa was thought not to have a voice at all .
but what are we going to do about the monkeys and loss aversion ?
ma : well the interesting part was i was asked what it was like to be the first woman secretary of state a few minutes after i &apos;d been named .
it &apos;s a fact .
♫ we will be long gone by then ♫ ♫ in lackluster ♫ ♫ in dust we lay around old magazines ♫ ♫ fluorescent lighting sets the scene ♫ ♫ for all we could and should be being ♫ ♫ in the one life that we &apos;ve got ♫ ♫ everybody says ♫ ♫ time heals everything ♫ ♫ and what of the wretched hollow ? ♫ ♫ the endless in between ? ♫ ♫ are we just going to wait it out ? ♫ ♫ just going to sweat it out ? ♫ ♫ just going to sweat it out ? ♫ ♫ wait it out ♫
this is their lobby .
in fact , this whole area is like a yellowstone national park with all of the trimmings .
( applause ) dinosaurs are kind of funny , you know .
( applause ) and it &apos;s counterintuitive , but the cost of energy expended for the flight is only two cents of a dollar today , and we &apos;re just at the beginning of this .
alexander rose came up with this idea of a spiraloid tower with continuous sloping ramps .
i &apos;ve always been attracted to those rare people who pull that off , who devote their lives to humanity with the grit of the warrior and the grace of the mystic — people like martin luther king , jr . , who wrote , &quot; &quot; i can never be what i ought to be until you are what you ought to be .
so even more important than buildings in a city are the public spaces in between them .
what you &apos;re watching is a design of a robotic red blood cell , and it does bring up the issue that our biology is actually very sub-optimal , even though it &apos;s remarkable in its intricacy .
we did sort of a simulation , because you had video discs , and again , this is &apos; 76 .
now there are many ways you can get infected .
kevin shangraw : the iraqi people are who we are there to help — and we just killed one .
so you have to be prepared .
now , i &apos;m from new york , so it &apos;s 100 percent satisfaction here .
it was three feet off the ground , and they said , &quot; &quot; what is this ? &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; yeah , it &apos;s , i don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) they said , &quot; &quot; why have you put it there ? &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; just like that . &quot; &quot; and they said , &quot; &quot; can we touch it ? &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; if you wish to . &quot; &quot; and i went away .
to do this though , we need to redesign education in a major way , to balance depth with interdisciplinary communication , and explicitly train people how to contribute to , and benefit from other disciplines .
and what you see , at the lower right-hand side there , is a sample in which a single sample of blood has been put on the top , and it has gone through and distributed itself into these 16 holes on the bottom , in a piece of paper — basically it looks like a chip , two pieces of paper thick .
so , i will . here &apos;s the vision for ted .
bipolar disorder is nicknamed the ceo disease .
now , for us environmentalists , maybe the greenest thing about the cities is they diffuse the population bomb .
and so even if we make those very important decisions for very silly reasons , it remains statistically true that there are more georges living in georgia and there are more dennises becoming dentists and there are more paulas who are married to paul than statistically viable .
i play the part of a magician , a wizard , if you will , a real wizard .
so obviously , we have a q &amp; a portion of our program , and people line up to mics to ask questions .
this ice formed as snow 15,800 years ago , when our ancestors were daubing themselves with paint and considering the radical new technology of the alphabet .
i have this job interview in galena in 15 minutes , and i need this job , i &apos;ve got to go . &quot; &quot; again he asked me , &quot; &quot; what do you think we should do ? &quot; &quot; i &apos;m in high school . i have no idea .

but if you &apos;re a geek like me , you say , &quot; &quot; well , what do the data say ? &quot; &quot; and you start to do things like graph things that we might be interested in — the total worldwide population , for example , or some measure of social development or the state of advancement of a society .
especially when chimpanzees , and other animals with large brains , are studied in captivity , modern technology is helping us to search for the upper levels of cognition in some of these non-human animals .
people used to say when they &apos;d come fund us , &quot; geoff , why do you provide these health services ? &quot;

apollo 11 . are you kidding me ?
the typical answer to the question — we had to design 1,040 apartments — would have looked like this : 24-story height limit given by the planning authorities , 12 towers with nothing but residual in between — a very tight system that , although the tower isolates you , it doesn &apos;t even give you privacy , because you &apos;re so close to the next one , that it is very questionable what the qualities of this would be .
so for every digital renegade that is revolting in the streets of tehran , there may as well be two digital captives who are actually rebelling only in the world of warcraft .

they &apos;re just not big enough .
and these guys are , like , serial offenders , and i &apos;m pretty sure everyone in this room has a refrigerator .
i &apos;m talking about , how do we secure the space , the demos , the platform of values , so that we can tap into all of your potential ?

sorry , when people say &quot; &quot; i can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; they &apos;re usually talking about their own lack of imagination , and not about the unlikelihood of the event that they &apos;re describing .

i &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
and the pipa trust board holds that license and pays the country for this .
on the vertical axis , you &apos;ll see the distribution of children &apos;s choices in each condition , and you &apos;ll see that the distribution of the choices children make depends on the evidence they observe .
but when you &apos;re down here , where the psycho milts of the world are adding one photo at a time , that &apos;s institution as obstacle .

in that same slum in nairobi , i met a young businesswoman , and she was making backpacks out of her home .
we &apos;re just trying to connect the two .

he &apos;s illiterate , and he communicates with voice messages .
and the school cow is trying to figure out how to replace the lawnmower on the playing field .
your blood tries to boil . it &apos;s called vaporization .

that means every bad loan goes bad 47 times over .
they both have rhinoviruses ; we &apos;ve never seen this pattern in lab .
and the result has been just the same as in william muir &apos;s experiment : aggression , dysfunction and waste .
now i trained in medicine in india , and after that i chose psychiatry as my specialty , much to the dismay of my mother and all my family members who kind of thought neurosurgery would be a more respectable option for their brilliant son .
and i &apos;ll just never forget when i started working on exoplanet atmospheres 20 years ago , how many people told me , &quot; &quot; this will never happen .
unfortunately , just across the road from it or quite close by is the column of marcus aurelius , and the diameter of the dirigible makes an impression , as you can see , as she starts trying to read the story that spirals around the column of marcus aurelius — gets a little too close , nudges it .

and in this tunnel , we use superconducting magnets colder than outer space to accelerate protons to almost the speed of light and slam them into each other millions of times per second , collecting the debris of these collisions to search for new , undiscovered fundamental particles .
so people continue to flee into neighboring countries , and we build refugee camps for them in the desert .
because for me , it feels like a fertile , creative medium .
that &apos;s two days ago .

i was quite impressed by this feat , at how what was essentially just a bag of cellular slime could somehow map its territory , know itself , and move with seeming intention .
i asked her why her side makes such outrageous allegations and lies about my side .

we came up with a fantasy scenario of a dj traveling around the states , that would collect records and go on tours .
but today , after 60 years , because of the rise of entrepreneurship , entrepreneurs have become role models , and they are contributing hugely to the society .
that holds the long strand like this .
what &apos;s the goal ?

i &apos;ve already told the people that we have tropical rain this time of year .

in sangin where i was sick in 2002 , the nearest health clinic was within three days walk .

i could try , but i can &apos;t .
it &apos;s a very violent process that is little known .
and detroit will make money on every unit .
so the stuff i &apos;m talking about is the peculiar problem of modern , affluent , western societies .
rendering authenticity — and the keyword is &quot; &quot; rendering . &quot; &quot; right ? rendering , because you have to get your consumers — as business people — to percieve your offerings as authentic .
and i was mentioning abed and myself , noting deliberately that i was here in peace , to the people in this town , when i met mohamed outside a post office at noon .
they introduced me to the new york city strategic alliance for health , again , free resources , don &apos;t waste them .
well , see , now i &apos;m thinking , i &apos;m in manhattan , this is a bad analogy , but most americans who don &apos;t live in manhattan get up in the morning and get in their cars and turn on that ignition , and their cars work , and they work incredibly well .
and my cousin , of course , the actor kevin bacon — ( laughter ) — who is my first cousin &apos;s twice removed &apos;s wife &apos;s niece &apos;s husband &apos;s first cousin once removed &apos;s niece &apos;s husband .
( applause ) but if you look at what we &apos;ve done , if you have the courage to really look at it , you &apos;ll see that not only do our kids think their worth comes from grades and scores , but that when we live right up inside their precious developing minds all the time , like our very own version of the movie &quot; &quot; being john malkovich , &quot; &quot; we send our children the message : &quot; hey kid , i don &apos;t think you can actually achieve any of this without me . &quot;
put them all together , and put all this under kind of natural selection , under mutation , and rewarded things for how well they can move forward .
as the novelty wore off , the months went by , there was some amount of tolerance , people got used to it .
so data is of course a massively useful tool to make better decisions , but i believe that things go wrong when data is starting to drive those decisions .
so when , as adults , we role-play , then we have a huge set of these scripts already internalized .
as a software developer and technologist , i &apos;ve worked on a number of civic technology projects over the years .
in a 2011 report from the institute for women &apos;s policy research , the gender wage gap between men and women was 23 percent .
for women without dense breasts , mammography is the best choice .

so it turned into a dual celebration , because natasha was the first person from this village ever to go to the united states .
his name is brian eno .
&quot; you get her . &quot; &quot; no , no , you take her . &quot;
i just want to represent them in a beautiful light .
but certainly , it &apos;s going to be going to the unknown america .
this is a pharmaceutical ad .
you &apos;ve probably all read about it or heard about in some incarnation . let me give you a two-sentence version of it .
it wasn &apos;t about the end result .
also there is a lot of data that still needs to be collected .
now this is doubly ironic when you consider that what gives comedy its edge at reaching around people &apos;s walls is the way that it uses deliberate misdirection .
i &apos;ve spent 59 days on the back of a camel from chad to timbuktu .
i &apos;ll never forget the sound of laughing with my friends . i &apos;ll never forget the sound
but i needed the support of the village , and here again , when the men heard , and the people heard that a woman had gotten an opportunity to go to school , they said , &quot; &quot; what a lost opportunity .
i &apos;ve learned about the poetry and the wisdom and the grace that can be found in the words of people all around us when we simply take the time to listen , like this interview between a betting clerk in brooklyn named danny perasa who brought his wife annie to storycorps to talk about his love for her .
it turns out , almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photoreceptors , and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication .
and so i said , &quot; &quot; did you just move into this office ? &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; no , we &apos;ve been here about a year . &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; are you telling me that i am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year ? &quot; &quot; and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; yeah . or maybe you &apos;re the only one who had to go to the bathroom . &quot;
but in order for me to explain what that is , i need to spend just a couple of minutes talking more about cancer itself .
but i have to tell you — everybody always asks , &quot; &quot; what happened to the baby baboon ? &quot; &quot; it did die , and we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights .
that &apos;s because the ideology , the governing ideology of apple is the ideology of the perfectionist product designer in cupertino .
she would not stop trying to feed me penguins .
and i didn &apos;t like that war , i thought it was stupid .

they were sent out on the most dangerous missions and they sustained the highest combat casualty rate of any unit proportionally .
we got past the janitor .
and after even 30 years of doing this , after 30 years of exploring the ocean , i never cease to be amazed at the extraordinary encounters that i have while i &apos;m at sea .
it &apos;s the &quot; &quot; what &quot; &quot; detector .
and this is the first device that we did , and i &apos;m going to talk about my second wish , which has something to do with this .
when powerful people misused their privilege , we were going to get them .
first is the simple power of good visualization tools to help untangle complexity and just encourage you to ask questions you didn &apos;t think of before .
i wanted to think about what else i could put shadows on , and i thought of my friend bernie .
this was how computing began .
what if the cure for cancer or the answer the global warming lies in the head of a young female scientist who fails to progress ?
we told a security guard that she was missing , though she wasn &apos;t missing .
so i look up and i &apos;m thinking , maybe he &apos;s still going to think i &apos;m kind of cute . &quot; &quot; &quot; ma , are you still doing that ? &quot;
i can &apos;t get my father in italy to work on the internet .
so this problem is absolutely soluble .
what i take away , and this in some ways is the most important , he espoused and exhibited a reverence for dignity that was really , really unusual .
scientists , sort of at the end of the 20th century , learned that they could track blood flow to map non-invasively where activity was going on in the human brain .
because it &apos;s so cold , the entire contents of that hut is still as they left it , with the remnants of the last meal they cooked still there .
one has asperger syndrome . one has adhd .
that night she asked me , &quot; how come you are not joining the beauty pageant ? &quot;
it doesn &apos;t matter how hard i train , i &apos;m never actually going to get there .
that is going to be the price .
and there is a sound chamber .
this shows you a patent landscape .
these are choices that your grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are going to have before them .
so , part of this story , i think — well , it &apos;s a terrifying story , it &apos;s a very dark story and it &apos;s a story that continues on in many of the developing cities of the world .
anyway , i went home that night . i thought about it .
and they ended up naming the company warby parker .
so to just end up , there are things of suffering in the one billion poorest , which we don &apos;t know .
it had recently gone public and the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars , a number i didn &apos;t really understand .
the interesting thing is that intuitive eaters are less likely to be overweight , and they spend less time thinking about food .
and what we learned was that we needed to think about redesigning courses .
that &apos;s also an insult to history .
to get from age zero to three was hard .
there &apos;s no question he &apos;s hitting above his weight .
tm : my mother &apos;s biggest concern when i transitioned was who was going to love me as i am .
and chris is a fisherman farmer . both are generalists .
this is one of the first results that came out of our study a little over a year ago that really surprised us .
now , this is dr. lene harbott applying electrodes to the head of john morton .
and i looked at word analysis .
all this would do is wreck a family .
( laughter ) ca : i guess , i don &apos;t think there is like a one-minute other piece you guys can do ?
for centuries , they &apos;ve been used to look at things like bacteria .
and they all treat learning , not as some sort of academic , analytical activity , but as that &apos;s something that &apos;s productive , something you make , something that you can do , perhaps earn a living from .
and the next six months of my life were the hardest time in my career , trying to design , build and deploy out in the field these 25 time-lapse cameras .
so these are all 3,214 pictures taken up there .
i &apos;m talking about dying .
a seemingly endless evolution of self and a community , but also this really deep desire not to leave anyone behind .
it &apos;s safe to say that we reimagined some traditions , but we also kept some old ones that we worked in , and we created something that worked for us .
and people magazine , i thought , got probably the best shot .
the data says it all the time .
i &apos;ll give you an example here .
but what are states and nations ?
( laughter ) rb : it &apos;s a tough job , isn &apos;t it ?
this caused major riots in my city .
two big storms and this notion of &quot; &quot; walk the walk &quot; &quot; prompted creation of elam back in 1998 .
( laughter ) and i had a choice in that moment , as all grenade throwers do .
who here has had surgery ?
if they &apos;re not working , put a shelf on it , which i did , and that shows all the customers my products .
and actually , private companies help governments with taxes .
it &apos;s not good .
nonetheless , when you hear real laughter and when you hear posed laughter , the brains are responding completely differently , significantly differently .
he had a lesser charge of forgery , got a year sentence and died a hero to the dutch people .
and this is actually a real photograph of earth taken by the voyager 1 spacecraft , four billion miles away .
ultimately , that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . &quot; &quot; why don &apos;t we all team up ? why don &apos;t we bring truce to life ?
why hasn &apos;t this happened sooner , and what can we do with it next ?
so was martin luther king , jr . so was dorothy day .
then it changes again .
everybody agrees with it .
and some of them were available . so , we hired one .
there is growing demand , growing population .
( laughter ) now , sylvia browne is an exception , an exception in one way , because the james randi educational foundation , my foundation , offers a one million dollar prize in negotiable bonds .
so here we are using 20 million barrels a day — producing eight , importing 12 , and from the 12 , five comes from opec .
if you ask people about what part of psychology do they think is hard , and you say , &quot; &quot; well , what about thinking and emotions ? &quot; &quot; most people will say , &quot; &quot; emotions are terribly hard .
it &apos;s all hidden in this code , and it &apos;s starting to be understood at breakneck pace .
this energy that is in your arm will not be in your legs .
in these seconds , your eyes are watching , left and right , left and right , and your brain wants those pictures to be identical .
and it &apos;s known for prostitution , violence , drugs : a hard place to grow up .
the head says there &apos;s a way forward .
we streamed data from the bedside instruments in their pediatric intensive care so that we could both look at the data in real time and , more importantly , to store the data so that we could start to learn from it .
and she created a dance piece which then prime minister nehru saw .
there &apos;s an effect on you and on your leaders .
this song is called &quot; &quot; the alphabet ...
integrative design can also increase energy savings in industry .
not infinite concentration of wealth , but the higher the gap between r and g , the higher the level of inequality of wealth towards which society tends to converge .
they would take the picture and then i would secret out from behind my robe a chocolate gold coin .
it &apos;s an actual thing .
this girl was raped repeatedly , forcefully penetrated with a blunt rod , beaten , bitten , and left to die .
that kind of makes sense to us .
don &apos;t do that .
so this is just one experiment that we published a few years ago , where a monkey , without moving its body , learned to control the movements of an avatar arm , a virtual arm that doesn &apos;t exist .
i just found this . what do you think we should do with it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t know , put it in the lost and found . &quot;
bone .
i &apos;m also interested in working with unusual materials and common materials in unusual ways .
creativity : it took creativity to solve the problem of getting all the thumbs into the node .
design thinkers believe that everyone is creative .
the same spot , it was a crime spot where people were being robbed .
it really goes beyond distinction .
if you want to know about africa , read our literature — and not just &quot; &quot; things fall apart , &quot; &quot; because that would be like saying , &quot; i &apos;ve read &apos; gone with the wind &apos; and so i know everything about america . &quot;
could you regenerate a limb ?
thank you .
and this blew his mind . literally . he checked into a sanitarium . ( laughter ) and when he came out of the sanitarium , he was convinced that he had been put on earth to found transfinite set theory because the largest set of infinity would be god himself .
and then , by using it in a targeted approach we &apos;re going to try to differentiate the machinery to recover function in old age .
so if you take the average commute time in america , which is about 50 minutes , you multiply that by the 120 million workers we have , that turns out to be about six billion minutes wasted in commuting every day .
have you heard of the idea of the mozart effect ?
was more than i could have hoped for .
but for the past eight years , i &apos;ve done something completely different .
and this is the kind of call that is used by , say , right whale mothers and calves as they separate to come back again .
so we took too many of them .
this is the nomadic dream , a different kind of american dream lived by young hobos , travelers , hitchhikers , vagrants and tramps .
i think black guys generally know where they &apos;re going .
i knew i would find her someday , or we would find each other .
she was born with very badly deformed back legs and pelvis .
it &apos;s the only threat , the only influence that the reef had to deal with .
first , no real sports fan would talk that way .
but you hit &quot; &quot; submit order . &quot; &quot; and two days later , this package shows up on your doorstep .
umar is seven years old , and he &apos;s from northern nigeria .
what &apos;s hard in our decision-making is when these two rules conflict .
maybe something like this .
that &apos;s what i thought — and i was shocked when i saw a picture of it .
no longer does aids need to kill two million a year .
there was a time when i considered wild soundscapes to be a worthless artifact .
if we think about drug treatment today , all the major breakthroughs — for hiv , for tuberculosis , for depression , for diabetes — it &apos;s always a cocktail of drugs .
so we have , in skin pigmentation , one of these wonderful products of evolution that still has consequences for us today .
what are some other metamorphoses that you &apos;ve had ?
( laughter ) okay , now that sounds a little flip , but make no mistake , the stakes are very high .
but , in fact , the print date was the early 1980s , when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me .
bg : thank you very much .
so i went to sleep , and that was it for me .
so we really can make changes .
and some states have differential policies , county by county .
so what about the poorest two billion ?
but then in the end , what i decided was every time you finish writing the word , i would stop and i would give the card to somebody on the side of the road .
so for now , let &apos;s turn to the evidence for dark matter .
this is perhaps the best picture i have .
i am sure , i am optimistic , that they will make cities better than our most ambitious dreams .
we think the world really looks like our buildings .
if you were not able to take the scoreboard out of the arena and be able to do the ice capades the next night , that would also be bad .
great , right ?
he grew up in a bohio of dirt floors , and the structure was the kind used by the tainos , our old arawak ancestors .
we are a bottom-heavy culture in more ways than one .
but hopefully , it was said with enough conviction that it was at least alluringly mysterious .
but maybe me , i give out something better because i give them hope . &quot; &quot; and in the middle of this economic crisis , where so many of us are inclined to pull in with fear , i think we &apos;re well suited to take a cue from jane and reach out , recognizing that being poor doesn &apos;t mean being ordinary .
that &apos;s not going to be happening , but you can see that the line comes down faster if they &apos;re not put under international pressure , if they &apos;re allowed to pursue their own devices .
that can &apos;t be energetically sensible .
philosophers have told us for thousands of years that the power to create is very closely linked to the power to destroy .
roman mars : according to the north american vexillological association .
the indians don &apos;t even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in india fill two or three gallons every time .
have you ever had a nagging feeling that one day you will be discovered as a fraud ?
i know the response to this .
we &apos;re not the first ones to build houses for our young .
but in this case it happened in real life .
mind your language .
the armillaria is actually a predatory fungus , killing certain species of trees in the forest .
and i tend to be a person who thinks too much and talks too little .
16 percent ! meaning that there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle , but only .16 percent of actual metastases — suggesting that maybe skeletal muscle is able to control the angiogenesis , is able to control the tumors recruiting these blood vessels .
but in fact , what they said was , &quot; &quot; leave doug and come down yourself .
it &apos;s the second world war .
the legends that you see in the movie don &apos;t appear for the monkey .
and this is an approach that &apos;s used all over the world , including in our lab .
( laughter ) okay . we are actually the first species on earth to be so prolific to actually threaten our own survival .
among the many memorable episodes of that retreat ... ( laughter )
so , we wondered : can we do anything useful with this capacity to control metabolic flexibility ?
on the path that american children travel to adulthood , two institutions oversee the journey .
so here &apos;s two sort of canonical neurons from a vertebrate and an invertebrate , a human pyramidal neuron from ramon y cajal , and another cell to the right , a non-spiking interneuron , and this is the work of alan watson and malcolm burrows many years ago , and malcolm burrows came up with a pretty interesting idea based on the fact that this neuron from a locust does not fire action potentials .
there &apos;s another one that throws plates and breaks them .
the u.s. attorney general recently released a report stating that they &apos;re going to ban solitary confinement in new york state for teens .
now , bluefin were revered by man for all of human history .
observe the upper-left one .
artificial intelligence used to be about putting commands in a box .
dh : right now ?
i had an awareness of being in my body , but also being out of my body , somewhere else , watching from above as if it was happening to someone else .
and i think this just shows how we were approaching the problem of incredibly large-scale construction .
and if you now try to cram 100,000 chimpanzees into oxford street , or into wembley stadium , or tienanmen square or the vatican , you will get chaos , complete chaos .
she is confined under the four walls of her home .
a committee of 12-year-old children would find out in 20 minutes that the most efficient way to use scarce road space is with exclusive lanes for buses .
it &apos;s not that hard a problem .
i think that &apos;s pretty exciting : tune-in literary fiction .
and the good thing about them is that they are deciding which houses go next .
we are graduating members from the class of we made it , not the faded echoes of voices crying out , &quot; names will never hurt me . &quot;
you and i can experience things without a story .
in that nine months , i went around the country and i talked to hundreds of people that were locked up , and i talked to many businesses that were also operating in afghanistan .
what we &apos;re done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wikipedia page and we reduced it down to a little summary .
the other things they &apos;ve worked on — i didn &apos;t have time to say this in my talk — is they &apos;ve restored functional hearing to thousands of deaf people .
the great success story of india , a country that so many learned scholars and journalists assumed would disintegrate , in the &apos; 50s and &apos; 60s , is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus .
we , after it &apos;s fermented and it &apos;s developed , started to develop flavor and character , we divide it into smaller units .
now i know there are people out there who will say that the election of barack obama meant that it was the end of racial discrimination for all eternity , right ?
this was one of the great things about my year , doing the sabbath , because i am a workaholic , so having this one day where you cannot work , it really , that changed my life .
we can &apos;t keep taking without expecting serious consequences as a result .
and this is maybe what explains why , for 30 years , he continued to make false papers at the expense of all kinds of sacrifices .
and here &apos;s the trick .
if australia disappears tomorrow , terror is probably the right response .
the biggest asset , in my opinion , one of the biggest assets in bertie county right now is this man : this is dr. chip zullinger , fondly known as dr. z.
or your memory sticks that you have now can carry one gigabyte of stuff on them — before , it was 256 .
it &apos;s all the things a phone should be .
i &apos;m going to be talking about designing humor , which is sort of an interesting thing , but it goes to some of the discussions about constraints , and how in certain contexts , humor is right , and in other contexts it &apos;s wrong .
especially when good things happen , and , in particular , when bad things happen .
this is where people make decisions , where they develop willpower .
in 1987 i heard of a story about a boy that fell through ice and was trapped under a river .
mohamed nanabhay who &apos;s sitting with us , the head of aljazeera.net , he told me that a 2,500 percent increase of accessing our website from various parts of the world .
no life without tectonic activity , without volcanic activity .
( audio : &quot; &quot; mary had a little lamb &quot; &quot; ) and so , again , that sounds distorted , but what &apos;s really amazing here is that we were able to do this with something that you could literally run out and pick up at a best buy .
you know , it &apos;s the empathy and the compassion that comes out of having relationships with people who are different from you .
we &apos;re already starting to see early retirement occur this year .
and , for example , this — if we go back here — this has become surprisingly popular among composers finding musical forms by searching the computational universe .
you probably think of fbi agents gunning down bad guys like john dillinger , or arresting corrupt politicians .
in one famous example from decades ago , the management of vanity fair magazine actually circulated a memo entitled : &quot; forbidding discussion among employees of salary received . &quot;
and this is where i think we can take a leaf out of systems theory , systems engineers , where they create feedback loops , put the right information at the right point of time .
here &apos;s another example of how comparing to the past can befuddle our decisions .
finally , self-organizing systems , about which , again , i won &apos;t say too much because you &apos;ve been hearing all about it .
a victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement &apos;s use of images .
i should add that it &apos;s very simple to add things like hair , clothes , etc . , but what we &apos;ve done here is use a very simple visualization , so you can concentrate on the movement .
so they &apos;re crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second , and as they do so , they not only curve space , but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space , an actual wave on space-time .
what does it look like ?
but one day , something happened .
anybody know what this is ? it ’ s the peyote cactus .
yet it &apos;s one that &apos;s rarely asked .
cheeto paint is a very simple way to paint with cheetos .
this is the craft that was going on , but there are a few collectors who also collect art which can depreciate .
( laughter ) so we have the watches and the language , and you &apos;re detecting a theme here , right ?
but it &apos;s important to note that all of this retrofitting is not occurring — just bulldozers are coming and just plowing down the whole city .
why don &apos;t you let your family stay home , because you do know that you get a 30-day leave .
so on that frame , the children who are typical are watching this , the emotion of expression of that little boy as he &apos;s fighting a little bit with the little girl .
so when do you play baseball ?
what evidence is there for this ?
it &apos;s that acrid , tar-like flavor .
and then , only a week and a half ago , we flew over the north pole of titan and found , again , we found a feature here the size of the caspian sea .
( applause ) so we &apos;re building these buildings .
it &apos;s so much more subtle , so much more visceral — you know , what &apos;s visible , what &apos;s not .
so i just switched on in the train , loudly .
i know this . i &apos;ve spent most of my career researching these programs .
and how could a digital identity of a company be embodied in a building ?
but we ’ re nowhere near the endgame when it comes to our perception .
you don &apos;t understand laughter fully by the time your brain has matured at the end of your teens .
a commitment device is a decision that you make with a cool head to bind yourself so that you don &apos;t do something regrettable when you have a hot head .
they &apos;re open because they ask the audience to be a player , a protagonist , a partner , rather than a passive spectator , and they &apos;re open because they know that imagination cannot be contained in buildings , and so much of the work they do is site-specific or outdoor work .
well , that doesn &apos;t really cut it anymore .
here in the united states , i think you see it in this election campaign : a longing for change .
and , long story short , again , they &apos;ve been so successful .
in particular , &quot; &quot; the supper at emmaus &quot; &quot; which was viewed as vermeer &apos;s finest masterpiece , his best work — people would come &#91; from &#93; all over the world to see it — was actually a forgery .
our ability to imagine makes us inventors and creators and unique .
and we have a little storage room where we converted a jail .
but saving is exactly the wrong thing to do from the system point of view .
second , in play , he &apos;s a national champion bridge player .
so the whole point of that is not , sort of , to make , like , a circus thing of showing exceptional beings who can jump , or whatever .
they most likely did the same as mr. domingos : &quot; &quot; ah ! what &apos;s this ? i &apos;m not understanding , it &apos;s going to the garbage &quot; &quot; .
and this is the pump .
he was back in luton , he was now 82 , and i hadn &apos;t seen him for 30-odd years , and when he opened the door , i saw this tiny little man with lambent , smiling eyes , and he was smiling , and i &apos;d never seen him smile .
warm-blooded animals take a huge hit at this time .
but when we think about the kind of possibilities i paint , we should feel a bit of fear .
i think it &apos;s excessive internet use in general , excessive video gaming , excessive new access to pornography .
the beauty of this is that once you plant a few dead bodies in that land , it can &apos;t be touched , it can &apos;t be developed on — hence the term , &quot; &quot; conservation burial . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s the equivalent of chaining yourself to a tree post-mortem — &quot; &quot; hell no , i won &apos;t go !
it &apos;s used for public health awareness campaigns such as the prevention of cholera .
ok , you can do that ? yeah ? ok .
it was also an expensive fight .
you don &apos;t need to believe me . you shouldn &apos;t believe me .
and because these are artists , they have very artistic temperaments .
and they did start to evolve .
now the americans in the audience will know all about cup stacking .
now let &apos;s take a look at hiv .
he will urinate and spin his tail to spread the urine around and make him more attractive .
and of course , it wasn &apos;t actually a working mine anymore , because , though ray was a miner there , the mine had closed and had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction , because , of course , it can &apos;t compete on the scale of operations which are happening in south america , australia , wherever .
the protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women like rose mapendo .
you see all of these nuances .
now , it &apos;s clear that our investment in breast cancer has produced results .
it took 23 hours . i did it with my neurosurgeon .
needless to list them here , and there are more competent people to talk about this .
the amount of a moderate-to-severe snow melting of an area equivalent to the size of california .
those who were still around in school , besides the people who had dropped out .
you can imagine , the musicians were disconsolate .
thank you all very much .
and all over india , at the end of about two years , children were beginning to google their homework .
could we reinvent fire ?
but we observed that there are no cells entering the brains of these animals .
they dance , they act — and the more they do , they are praised .
and that was one of the reasons why the web wasn &apos;t quite as emergent as it could be because you needed two-way linking , you needed that kind of feedback mechanism to be able to really do interesting things .
when those mujahideen defeated the soviet union , we disengaged .
this is just an example of one of these computable documents .
and the answer is , every single swedish business leader does that every single day .
yeah . i thought so . not surprised .
so , why would you want to replicate bit strings ?
we look at the savings rate and it has been declining since the 1950s .
they &apos;re actually identical , so it &apos;s quite cost-effective .
we turned the building into what we called now the archive house .
so , when we look back and step out at this and see the beginning of these trends that we &apos;re seeing in our data , we see a very hopeful picture for the future of america .
when something becomes ultra-low cost , it becomes massively scalable .
our kids &apos; teachers seem to be failing them .
or if we analyzed our data by sex .
so it &apos;s something we need to focus on .
they can produce loud clicks and listen for echoes from the sea floor in order to orient .
we actually saw seals out of our car window , and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them and then blocked them with our giant heads .
( laughter ) piles of dirty socks on the floor , more boring sports shows than i ever thought possible — ( laughter ) and fights that bring me to tears when it feels like we &apos;re not speaking the same language .
but what &apos;s really important here is , look at all those dots .
iw : but last year , we did exactly that .
when she spoke to the three friends and the stranger , they had not had a nice time — it &apos;s actually rather difficult , it &apos;s rather awkward ...
they were things like , what are the capitals of the 44 or 45 states that existed at that time ?
but we try to stand on our feet , to do something , little things , we can for our people .
this guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named ami tabar .
i &apos;m just showing the new york times website here .
but today , i &apos;m going to use a different approach , one that is inspired by these two initiatives here , a harmonic one and a philosophical one .
one of my favorites has always been : &quot; make love to your man in a chevy van , &quot; because that was my vehicle when i was in college .
this is worthy of sachin tendulkar .
and as an activist , that was not good enough .
so these action neighborhoods , as i call them , really become the inspiration to imagine other interpretations of citizenship that have less to do , in fact , with belonging to the nation-state , and more with upholding the notion of citizenship as a creative act that reorganizes institutional protocols in the spaces of the city .
the other third didn &apos;t lie , or perhaps forgot , or you &apos;re lying to me about your lying , which is very , very devious . ( laughter ) this fits with a lot of the research , which suggests that lying is very pervasive .
so then we said , how many people were executed on march 29 , 1984 ?
( laughter ) and i heard that , and that was all i needed .
and now let &apos;s compare that with fish farming .
the fact : population growth in countries with high laptop — ( laughter ) i need hans rosling to give me a graph .
ca : that scale delivers efficiency .
i think if marianne and the members of her women &apos;s group can talk about this openly and have this discussion out amongst themselves and in public , we can , too .
as you can see on this map , russia is still the largest country in the world .
management reports are full of complaints about the lack of clarity .
in too many 401 ( k ) plans , if people do nothing , it means they &apos;re not saving for retirement , if they don &apos;t check the box .
you will feel loved and appreciated like never before and reconnect with friends and acquaintances you haven &apos;t heard from in years .
and we did . we got better material .
be sure to enjoy windows for radio at home and at work .
and that gets me to one of the biggest deals about 3d printing .
but there &apos;s also the fact that law is another place where there are many opinions in circulation , but they need to be resolved to one canonical copy , and when you go onto github , and you look around , there are millions and millions of projects , almost all of which are source code , but if you look around the edges , you can see people experimenting with the political ramifications of a system like that .
they say you never forget the names of those who die .
but once they find it , that dna is still tiny , and surrounded by so much other dna , that what these machines then do is copy the target gene , and one copy piles on top of another , millions and millions and millions of copies , until that gene stands out against the rest ; until we can visualize it , interpret it , read it , understand it , until we can answer : does my pig have the flu ?
this high level group agreed to honestly discuss the merits and flaws of drug policies .
well , fascinatingly , it turns out that if you give children antibiotics in the first six months of life , they &apos;re more likely to become obese later on than if they don &apos;t get antibiotics then or only get them later , and so what we do early on may have profound impacts on the gut microbial community and on later health that we &apos;re only beginning to understand .

in many african countries the modern sector is lost .
but it could spread everywhere .

so this is attempting to make potato starch plastic .
what &apos;s the difference ?
so , this theory is that the brain creates , builds , a version of the universe , and projects this version of the universe , like a bubble , all around us .
it &apos;s just a lesion formed inside .
because i had someone dear to me snatched away .

cell phones are thrown away by the hundreds of millions every year , hundreds of millions in the u.s. alone , not counting the rest of the world , which of course we should do , but in fact , cell phones are great .
this may be surprising .
it has shrunk because our instruments enable us in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time , and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding of the material world , and this granular understanding has generated reams of data that our brains can no longer comprehend and for which we need more and more complicated computers .
so they all have his number .
so this is great . this is the digital meeting the physical .
( laughter ) it &apos;s a great way to start sentences .
and as she was talking , a thought came to my mind .
we have skin enhancements , clothing .

the solution , i think , is that we use language at two levels : the literal form signals the safest relationship with the listener , whereas the implicated content — the reading between the lines that we count on the listener to perform — allows the listener to derive the interpretation which is most relevant in context , which possibly initiates a changed relationship .
the second initiative was also home-grown , but is today a global movement to reform the international drug control regime .
ca : well , daniel , you have done a spectacular job of helping us all see the world in a different way .
as people who live in countries with high per capita emissions , we &apos;re making that choice on behalf of others as well .
and they were saying , you know , &quot; &quot; the architects , norman was always going on about designing for the future , and you know , it didn &apos;t seem to cost us any more .
at age three , if you have a still-growing brain , it &apos;s a human behavior .
you &apos;d still have five &#91; million &#93; pounds in change , and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down .
( music ) ( applause ) ( music ) ( music ends ) ( applause ) tm : thank you very much .
so every idea is basically being supported — or every item , or every noun — is being supported by the entire web .
except for some of the recent announcements here in the united states and in europe , it &apos;s an area of consumer protection that &apos;s almost entirely naked .
only george could call me rosy .
and then there was the time when another classmate walked into my dorm room , and yelled , &quot; &quot; ew ! &quot; &quot; as i was applying hair grease to my scalp .
and then he said , &quot; you remind me of my mother . &quot;
where does the silica come from ?
all we need is a little bit of empathy and some curiosity , to go out there , observe .
and what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that &apos;s not the highest quality data .
it simply makes the point that we need to disrupt our zones of familiarity .
until midnight , he &apos;d be thinking .
now , where are we going with this here ?
it was about that human-ocean connection .
eh : so you have a father who &apos;s absent , you have a mother for whom apparently nothing is good enough .
so the hope here is that we can make the invisible visible .
in fact , he &apos;s a teacher at the kennedy school over there in boston .
it led me to meet president johnson .
so i bought a month &apos;s worth of classes .
even up to a year later , american parents were more likely to express negative emotions , as compared to their french counterparts .
it &apos;s not a bank . we had to actually go into these companies and earn our return by fixing them — by establishing management systems , by providing all that knowledge , how do you run a business on one side — while they all know how to run , how to create content .
so the cell on the left , you can see , it fires whenever the animal gets near to a wall or a boundary to the east , whether it &apos;s the edge or the wall of a square box or the circular wall of the circular box or even the drop at the edge of a table , which the animals are running around .
so the last project i want to talk to you about is another collaboration with chris milk .
and it &apos;s getting harder to hide assets , tax avoidance , pay inequality . so that &apos;s great . we &apos;re starting to find out more and more about these systems .
this is where we are in this process .
ah , isn &apos;t that cool ?
one hundred twenty-five girls will not be married when they &apos;re 12 years old .
so , what we call this is a silicon cottage industry .
they had zero impact on energy consumption .
these are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells .
it &apos;s that reeeee-e-e-each out , the physical contortion to get that device just below the tabletop .
it &apos;s not that simple .
( laughter ) &quot; &quot; what is this ?
this is why , if you get a christmas card from , like , your great aunt in minnesota , there &apos;s usually a fuzzy penguin chick on it , and not something like a glacier bay wolf spider .
so they would come up with all these ideas .
i could be that person . &quot; &quot; but what if you are that person ?
and so we &apos;ll just very briefly , class — we don &apos;t have a lot of time — we &apos;ll just very briefly hear from a man on our topic at this stage .
so identity was primarily defined by ethnicity , and the nation-state reflected that .
forms of organization can have a profound impact on human nature .
this is opec &apos;s revenue , this green box here — 780 billion a year .
number seven : try not to repeat yourself .
so basically , kids of all ages , like us .
and suddenly it makes a difference in terms of making space accessible .
we as men , good men , the large majority of men , we operate on the foundation of this whole collective socialization .
if you could control somebody &apos;s attention , what would you do with it ?
and so there was a moment when suddenly — actually , the next thing .
i bet most of us have experienced at some point the joys of less : college — in your dorm , traveling — in a hotel room , camping — rig up basically nothing , maybe a boat .
and most of what we know about regret comes to us out of that domain .
i mean you probably saw these headlines . this is catherine casey who is the first boomer to actually get social security .
it &apos;s as though the mystery of the person they &apos;re interacting with and connecting allows them to be themselves just a bit more .
so i really think that , as we learn more , it &apos;s going to turn out that the whole fly brain is just like a large version of this stomatogastric ganglion , and that &apos;s one of the reasons why it can do so much with so few neurons .
( audio ) baby : gagagagagaga gaga gaga gaga guga guga guga wada gaga gaga guga gaga wader guga guga water water water water water water water water water .
more importantly , changing diets .
it will be completely free , and it will work in any browser .
other sands , when these micrometeorites come in , they vaporize and they make these fountains , these microscopic fountains that go up into the — i was going to say &quot; &quot; up into the air , &quot; &quot; but there is no air — goes sort of up , and these microscopic glass beads are formed instantly , and they harden , and by the time they fall down back to the surface of the moon , they have these beautiful colored glass spherules .
but the welfare workers and the ambulance people and the judge all said the same thing : &quot; we hate to do it but we have to follow procedure . &quot;
britain always played to the balance .
this view is sometimes called panpsychism : pan for all , psych for mind , every system is conscious , not just humans , dogs , mice , flies , but even rob knight &apos;s microbes , elementary particles .
it &apos;s a parasitic brain worm that has to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow in order to continue its life cycle .
i &apos;m here for two reasons . these two guys are my two sons ford and wren .
and because we must all work to finish this story .
where scarcely a quarter believed in the honesty of elections in 2010 — i &apos;m surprised it was a quarter — 90 percent thought that this last election was honest .
in this picture , i &apos;ve put a bush with a center branching out in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms : it has survived ; it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment .
i think we &apos;re going to see a community of storytellers evolve and emerge .
using the power of the smartphone , it can examine the cube and solve the cube in five seconds .
it &apos;s a part of the space that &apos;s accessible to animals ; since we are animals , we are a subset of that .
ca : ah . who did you make the bet with ?
children being used , cynically exploited ; people dying in conflicts which i was supporting in the name of jihad .
so do not kill your orange balloons .
these forests utilize 100 percent vertical space .
so humans are turning more towards animal consumption .
and why should we care about this ?
whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets , beginning with adam , including noah , including moses , including abraham , including jesus christ , and ending with muhammad — that , &quot; &quot; we have not sent you , o muhammad , except as a &apos; rahmah , &apos; except as a source of compassion to humanity . &quot; &quot; for us human beings , and certainly for us as muslims , whose mission , and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet is to make ourselves as much like the prophet .
this is who i was , but this is who i wanted to be : angelina jolie .
you &apos;re not really given any instructions , but the forces of the process itself keep you in place .
so , if you look at this image , right away you might be able to see that there are clusters of obese and non-obese people in the image .
but now we got eagles out there , f15s , even that bald eagle .
it sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator .
and my kids , from the poorest congressional district in america , became the first to install a green wall , designed by a computer , with real-live learning tools , 21 stories up — if you &apos;re going to go visit it , it &apos;s on top of the john hancock building .
meanwhile , the parents — perhaps a little busy at work , running late , running errands — want a little slack to pick the kids up late .
so this is what we started with 15 years ago , with the cosmic background explorer — made the map on the upper right , which basically showed us that there were large-scale fluctuations , and actually fluctuations on several scales . you can kind of see that .
and you can use the tilt sensor to steer this car using this game .
they do distributed practice , so little shots of 40 minutes several days over a period of two weeks .
so this is absurd , right ?
56 percent of all rape cases don &apos;t result .
we already use about 50 percent of the earth &apos;s fresh water that &apos;s sustainable , and agriculture alone is 70 percent of that .
so i felt that i needed to do two things .
and the question is , why do people accept this ?
and what it means is we really are bayesian inference machines .
you are more the incredible shrinking woman than the buddhist mystic , serene , making do with less .
( laughter ) pm : and — lt : wait , no , it &apos;s really important because this is another example of how women are overlooked , put aside , marginalized .
pakistan and afghanistan are still so fragile that neither of them have dealt constructively with the problem of pashtun nationalism .
but it &apos;s a pretty miserable place to be in the winter .
if we just look on what happens , we see , temperature &apos;s too high .
it &apos;s gray , formless .
you can see some of the coral cores there on the right .
so , when you start to think about politicians , you &apos;ve got to realize these are strange creatures .
did you know that your name is worth eight points in scrabble ?
since then , i have continued to read about politics and geography and identity and what all those things mean .
because what that means is that for the first time in the history of the species , the majority of babies born in the developed world are having the opportunity to grow old .
and by the 1400s , music was being written that tried to mirror god &apos;s mind as could be seen in the design of the night sky .
so we created a factory system consistent with that false view of human nature .
what if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one ?
eventually i got an interview .
so what we &apos;re seeing now is very few penguins are oiled .
the servos in the front legs , we had to shape those like muscles .
she saw some similarities in one of the photographs , but couldn &apos;t quite make a positive identification .
here &apos;s lesson number one .
impossible to begin . enough . no . begin with the hapless dodo . &quot; &quot; and i talk about the dodo , and how the dodo became extinct , and then i talk about spinoza .
i find the stigma especially ironic , because i strongly believe that sanitation workers are the most important labor force on the streets of the city , for three reasons .
every culture is trying to understand itself : &quot; why do we exist ? &quot;
our newest brain , our homo sapien brain , our neocortex , corresponds with the &quot; &quot; what &quot; &quot; level .
the infrastructure group of google is the group that has to keep the website up and running 24 / 7 .
but we need to have early detection , early response .
so instead of how much you know about it , we could say , &quot; &quot; what can you ask about it ? &quot; &quot; so yes , you do need to know a lot of stuff as a scientist , but the purpose of knowing a lot of stuff is not just to know a lot of stuff . that just makes you a geek , right ?
an artist , i think , can really show us people that we might overlook in our lives .
( laughter ) your call . your call .
hire people who argue with you .
more recently , somebody even 3d-printed thom yorke &apos;s head , which is a little creepy , but pretty cool .
it fits 1,100 people , it &apos;s jammed to the gills , and up on the stage , waiting to shake your hand , waiting to hand you your ig nobel prize , are a bunch of nobel prize winners .
and all of that stuff is really disgusting , but what &apos;s really insidious is the biological pollution that happens because of the magnitude of the shifts that it causes to entire ecosystems .
and if we can change enough communities , we can change national attitudes .
and plus , he said he was going to get rid of the caps lock key — ( laughter ) — and the num lock key , too .
i know you &apos;re wondering if they did meet .
think about the youngest son who must obey the eldest son , who in turn must obey the patriarch .
and so you can see dinosaurs and insects and collections of locomotives and all of that , but you &apos;re really not involved ; you &apos;re being talked to .
you just have to find another term and look that up .
many of you all know about the concept of scanning for wireless networks .
do we stay in for life , or do we do something else and justify and say , well , my intentions were good , and therefore i cannot be held responsible for all of it ?
and so , that &apos;s a hard way to look at things , so i &apos;m just going to encode things as a little barcode , grouped by family , so you can see the results in a very intuitive way .
while in the third one , in the calling , very much likely i would do it also if i wouldn &apos;t be financially compensated for it .
so , this is really interesting . now we have an architecture that connects a city to the natural world in a very direct and immediate way .
and i needed to print another 1,500 more hours to complete printing my collection .
there are 98 oil-producing nations in the world .
so we , by making a whole bunch of attempts , thousands of attempts , in that four-year time period , we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today . and that &apos;s why they &apos;re so safe , as we gave it a lot of chance to find what &apos;s good .
secondly , it &apos;s imperative that you do not cite the new york times .
but they &apos;re getting very , very cheap , and look at the interesting implication of it . as they get cheaper , the premium brands , the sonys and such , are losing market share , and the no-names , the apexes , are gaining them .
i have in my pocket a check made out to the parent organization to the ted organization , the sapling foundation — a check for $ 7,100 to be applied toward my attendance for next year &apos;s ted .
and so , robin eggs failed to hatch , songbirds died en masse , towns fell silent .
( laughter ) now , the photographer who took the pictures for this project for some reason posed his dog in a lot of them , so that &apos;s why you &apos;re going to see this recurring character .
and in many ways , the law has worked .
with two mirrors , the scanner calculates the beam &apos;s horizontal and vertical angles , giving accurate x , y , and z coordinates .
it &apos;s more than a hundred years old and you can still see the fingermarks where the potter pinched it .
js : copyright policy isn &apos;t just about how to incentivize the production of a certain kind of artistic commodity ; it &apos;s about what level of control we &apos;re going to permit to be exercised over our social realities — social realities that are now inevitably permeated by pop culture .
whatever you want to call it , it &apos;s in conflict with the status quo of how we think about sanitation , which is contain , treat , push it away .
so we &apos;ve made an ultrasensitive cancer detector .
our artistic desire doesn &apos;t go away .
and that is the way cancer diagnosis has been done since the beginning of history .
some people , especially in latin america , think it &apos;s not really about drugs .
others battle oppressive societies .
it &apos;s not uncommon to hear people say that stories make the world a better place .
kids don &apos;t program enough and boy , if there &apos;s anything i hope this brings back , it &apos;s programming to kids .
and as an anthropologist , i see these differences in experience being rooted in the cultural and social world through which we define the phenomena around us .
we went back out for the final tour of the farm , and he showed me the wild pepper plants and the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity .
here is a picture of me aged four .
well , we believe it &apos;s a technique that we call moral reframing , and we &apos;ve studied it in a series of experiments .
they said , it &apos;s not worth the risk to our economy .
i mean , how much do we consume our memories ?
what can explain these huge spillover effects of education ?
on the left is the heart rate showing biology .
when i realized that climate change was real , and it was not based on computer models , i decided that one day i would do a project looking at trying to manifest climate change photographically .
( laughter ) nothing — not public radio , no podcast — ( laughter ) not even mindfulness meditation makes this time worth living . ( laughter )
so , it was always like , they called me kid david , because i was the kid .
this is a shot in one of the biggest squares in guangdong — and this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country .
but collision is a serious problem .
so let &apos;s see now how exponential technologies are taking health care .
one of my favorite glaciers , the sólheimajökull .
ca : you know , it &apos;s not richard branson . it &apos;s sir richard branson .
( applause ) ( music ) ( applause ) angella ahn : thank you . ( applause )
it &apos;s my job to make sure the collection stays okay , and that it grows , and basically it means i collect dead animals .
it &apos;s a military surveillance robot , to go in ahead of troops — looking at caves , for instance .
it &apos;s a huge challenge to understand .
( applause ) so over the years , we started going into other things .
imagine that we could try to engineer humans that have enhanced properties , such as stronger bones , or less susceptibility to cardiovascular disease or even to have properties that we would consider maybe to be desirable , like a different eye color or to be taller , things like that .
we come from somewhere and we are hopefully traveling all the time , moving towards a new place .
what i &apos;m looking for is a way to give the material the qualities that i need .
the first one was done in new delhi in 1999 .
and , approaching a building from a distance , you don &apos;t see too much ; you get a little closer , and you arrive at a nice little composition that might remind you of a mondrian or a diebenkorn or something .
i want you to come back to that time .
this is the twitter reports for over three days just covering mumbai .
so , smartypants , why isn &apos;t all surgery being done this way ? &quot; &quot; and there are some reasons , some good reasons .
so , you &apos;ll hear , tomorrow , from saul griffith . he was one of the first students to emerge from this program .
and that means humans will survive no matter what happens on earth .
oh , you &apos;re wiggling your toes .
our fate and the ocean &apos;s are one .
people stink !
new doctors were needed to make care sustainable , but where would they come from ?
( applause ) thank you .
look out for them . they &apos;re destined for great things .
thank you .
&#91; it &apos;s &#93; very easy to raise money for health-care ventures .
if we believe something like this , we must let go of the puppet-master completely , take our leave of the almighty controller , abandon traditional models .
i think these graceful insects are truly miraculous because they so beautifully illuminate the creative improvisation of evolution .
so a couple of years ago , i was supposed to go on an oceanographic cruise and i couldn &apos;t go because of a scheduling conflict .
so this , for example , is hydrogen-generating algae .
there &apos;s books about how to build a nuclear bomb .
every five years we have an election .
i hold these truths to be self-evident , but let me be clear : i &apos;m a mess .
and it made it doubly ironic — my computer background — a few years later , i think 2009 or so , when i got another phone call from &quot; &quot; jeopardy &quot; &quot; saying , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s early days yet , but ibm tells us they want to build a supercomputer to beat you at &apos; jeopardy . &apos; are you up for this ? &quot; &quot; this was the first i &apos;d heard of it .
well , for a hungry lion looking to eat , it enhances fitness .
he said , he said , he said , &apos; we can &apos;t , we can &apos;t let nobody find out about this . &apos; he say , &apos; you &apos;ve got to help me . &apos; i agree . i agree .
putting technology in the hands of the end user is usually a good idea because they &apos;ve got the best idea of what their needs are .
the whole place was absolutely silent , but the silence wasn &apos;t an absence of noise .
if you &apos;ll pardon the expression .
and you know , with the future billions that we &apos;ve been hearing about , the world is simply far too complex to understand in that way .
but mostly they evoke a feeling of caring .
so here &apos;s why i &apos;m convinced that we collectively have the power to make sustainable investing the new normal .
now here , i have a personal interest .
any advice for aspiring korean dancers ? &quot; &quot; now , she was the master . this photo was taken in 1948 and she was already a celebrated artist .
the reason we wanted to do that was because we needed to know how many individuals of this species are still left in that forest .
al jazeera . cnn . how did we get there ?
learning what you &apos;re successful at , managing it and keeping it is vital for us .
they do a lot of the similar things .
so you can actually change the climate .
i &apos;ll start here . last november there was a presidential election .
and in these big architectures of time , composers like beethoven could share the insights of a lifetime .
but from now on , we count per capita .
now , maybe that doesn &apos;t sound like a lot to you .
it killed almost everything that was left .
like looking away if you look at it too long because it gets shy , or things like that .
what a gift it was to the eager , young foreign correspondent that i was then .
about half of all trials , on average , go missing in action , and we know that positive findings are around twice as likely to be published as negative findings .
but that profit is the magic .
and i hope in the near future we can confirm this .
and then again the old will die and you will get two billion children .
nor did i get any responses from the other people that they gave me on the list where i could get apartments .
these are compost toilets , and nobody at the school wanted to know about them , especially the principal .
how many girls are involved now in your program ?
but if we come back today , during a normal condition to the exact same location , this is what &apos;s left .
when we start by teaching young people that we live , not in a passive society , a read-only society , but in a writable society , where we have the power to change our communities , to change our institutions , that &apos;s when we begin to really put ourselves on the pathway towards this open government innovation , towards this open government movement , towards this open government revolution .
and it &apos;s something that people have wanted forever .
they moved on to some other situation .
analyzing this data was hard . the originals were sheets of paper in arabic that had to be scanned and translated .
but he comes up with that , you know .
and those have been linked then with the rather alarming , growing rates of obesity , shown in these maps here , and that obesity has also been triggering great increases in heart disease and diabetes to the point where a child born today has a one-in-three chance of developing diabetes .
furniture that i can &apos;t fit in my ratty apartment .
this statistic might look familiar if you walked into a high school robotics club , or a college engineering class .
there &apos;s my first exploded view and all the little pieces and the little worm drive and all that stuff .
now , i want to tell you about a second epiphany that &apos;s related to that first one that i think can bring us progress , not just around the world , but right here at home .
they — i was put in a dormitory with a confirmed nazi sympathizer .
so let &apos;s watch what happens .
( laughter ) why were we not given the chance to solve that problem psychologically ?
a fifth of kids under two drinks soda .
and i saw from a young age that having a decent job and earning a good living made the biggest difference for families who were struggling .
god , the one who rules the entire universe , wants my bread ? &quot; &quot; he rushes to the synagogue . &quot; &quot; i &apos;ll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it . &quot; &quot; he goes in there , and it &apos;s not there .
thank you very much .
and there &apos;s a very important distinction there that we &apos;ll get to .
it &apos;s a somewhat more indirect way .
so this person is a key link in connecting mass media and social media together .
and you can do this same thing with a lot of different quantities , you know , with guesses about the total amount of storage , the number of servers , the number of drives per server , and in each case using what you know to come up with a model that narrows down your guesses for the things that you don &apos;t know .
and this whole structure would have to fly tens of thousands of kilometers away from the telescope .
well , most rights owners , instead of blocking , will allow the copy to be published .
and it &apos;s vital we understand this .
you have to exclude some people .
now , before i did my residency , i did a master &apos;s degree in public health , and one of the things that they teach you in public health school is that if you &apos;re a doctor and you see 100 kids that all drink from the same well , and 98 of them develop diarrhea , you can go ahead and write that prescription for dose after dose after dose of antibiotics , or you can walk over and say , &quot; &quot; what the hell is in this well ? &quot; &quot; so i began reading everything that i could get my hands on about how exposure to adversity affects the developing brains and bodies of children .
if you want to know how sea level rises from land-base ice melting this is where it reaches the sea .
yes , it &apos;s possible to do that .
now , one thing which we did for a laugh was to create a slightly more complex stunt scene , and one of the most famous stunts is the one where james bond jumps off a dam in switzerland and then is caught by a bungee .
( laughter ) farmers develop the most beautiful fortune-telling eyes by the time they &apos;re in their late 60s and 70s .
still in shock at such a young age , mohammed was struggling to get used to his new body .
then there is a rustle in the brush .
we &apos;ve got to cut the extraneous out of our lives , and we &apos;ve got to learn to stem the inflow .
it &apos;s on very steep ground .
this is the challenge and the opportunity for us .
so this is the infamous caulerpa taxifolia , the so-called killer algae .
you put it out there into the media and start thinking about it .
so somehow it shows what &apos;s there .
that was the paige typesetter .
so what is this hyperbolic geometry that corals and sea slugs embody ?
half of them are told that they &apos;re being given the shocks by somebody in another room , but the person in the other room doesn &apos;t know they &apos;re giving them shocks .
we &apos;re looking for competence , discipline , endurance , and strength .
so what &apos;s going on here ?
this is in the early 2000s . my son , dimitri — who &apos;s here , many of you know dimitri — went to cambodia , set up this school that we had built , just as the school connected it to the internet .
i am thinking now .
there &apos;s no recovery needed , no nothing .
more than how a phenomenon works , theoretical physicists are always interested in why a phenomenon works in the way it works .
i understand that . but , there are many things to know , and i want you to open your minds here , keep them open , and change your perspective about honeybees .
but we said , well , on the bright side , our harbor seals at least will not be bursting into flame anytime soon .
so lets say i &apos;m in monterey , and i want what ?
and the title of my talk was therefore &quot; &quot; indian innovation from gandhi to gandhian engineering . &quot; &quot; and i titled this more from less for more and more people as gandhian engineering .
it is about what we feed them .
the monkey is getting more detailed information from these surfaces .
and given that projections are that the bulk of economic growth over the next 15 years will come from emerging economies in the developing world , it could easily overtake the united states and become the largest economy in the world .
let &apos;s face it , it &apos;s the language of the internet , it &apos;s the language of finance , it &apos;s the language of air traffic control , of popular music , diplomacy — english is everywhere .
because they use mathematics we already have .
the truth is that &apos;s not always the case .
another way of looking at it is looking at time trends .
so what we did was we processed the images together , and we put two images into one blank screen .
so here &apos;s another few people trying it out .
technology is increasing at a comparable rate .
the mystery persisted for about 20 years .
and during that time , since i &apos;ve left university , these numbers have got bigger and bigger , each one dwarfing the last , until along came this man , dr. curtis cooper , who a few years ago held the record for the largest ever prime , only to see it snatched away by a rival university .
has he left ? is he watching the cow ?
and if i were to poke all the three legs of this in the three vertices of this triangle , i would make a tetrahedron .
and to my astonishment , they backed me 100 percent .
where , at the moment , we have something between six and seven billion people , it will grow to about nine billion in 2050 .
the humor reflects back on us .
( laughter ) was what any self-respecting researchers would have done .
because what can you do with that data ?
not only that , but they can also be used for disease models .
we &apos;re just beginning to understand what exact function these cells have , but what it implies is that the brain is capable of extraordinary change way into adulthood .
it pervades basically everything that we do .
in our imagination , it has to be light .
and that last point has made visual effects a constant quest for perfection .
how attractive are you ?
big changes for the better include the fact that today we enjoy much longer lives , much better health in our old age , and much better recreational opportunities .
whether i was laid on my side or strapped into my wheelchair .
if someone steps on them by accident or picks them up , they can explode .
the transactions are secured through cryptography , and over time , that transaction history gets locked in blocks of data that are then cryptographically linked together and secured .
its changes will affect all of humanity .
it &apos;s hard to believe that it &apos;s less than a year since the extraordinary moment when the finance , the credit , which drives our economies froze .
we think we &apos;re going to save more next year .
hire the scrapper .
and it &apos;s a kind of rope-like structure that twirls and swirls like this .
right ? they did .
but that &apos;s not a usual case in history .
business class morality is , don &apos;t bomb japan — they built my car .

we &apos;re going to start to pay them .
so the bands started to improvise new melodies .
i mean , i &apos;m an economist , but this is ultimately not an economic question , it &apos;s a moral question : are we willing , as americans , are we as a society still capable of making the political choice to sacrifice now by paying more taxes in order to improve the long-term future of not only our kids , but our community ?
we got reports like this .
if this is the case , then outflows from the exploding star may be associated with this gamma-ray burst .
they thought you just wear out , there &apos;s nothing you can do about it — kind of like an old shoe .
what does this mean ?
so by 2020 , we still see a labor surplus in some countries , like italy , france , the u.s. , but this picture will change dramatically by 2030 .
the hiv epidemic peaked .
ca : all right , so you don &apos;t support a carbon tax of any kind or a price on carbon .
so i started to study this as a journalist , and i realized that there was something really strange going on .
so what we found was , when tryptophan was low , people were more likely to take revenge when they &apos;re treated unfairly .
now over and over again , people have said , &quot; &quot; let &apos;s build bridges , &quot; &quot; and frankly , i want to do more than that .
it &apos;s qualitatively different .
it is not about documentation and contract .
what i &apos;m going to talk to you about tonight is stuff we might do if we did nothing .
we deal right now in the educational landscape with an infatuation with the culture of one right answer that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test , and i am here to share with you : it is not learning .
and what we &apos;re sharing were links , so you had to be kind of open with links .
well here &apos;s one by jessica green about the microbial ecology of buildings .
the first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day .
and even at that time , with the introduction of agriculture , 8,000 , 10,000 years ago we started to see climate change .
it becomes a desire , a need , an armor .
everyone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult .
then there &apos;s all the other memes that can &apos;t be pronounced .
it &apos;s something much bigger .
i don &apos;t perceive what i &apos;m drawing as ice or water .
it was then that god intervened : news on the tv of a car wreck that hours before had killed three people up north .
and this is codex c here .
the same thing the next day , and then the next , quickly slipping into a creative slump .
and you can see it &apos;s just a really spectacular extension of the limbs , exploding upward to actually just catch a dead piece of shrimp that i had offered it .
but it has been amazingly successful in one regard , in that it has become , it has congealed into this endangered people &apos;s movement that was missing in the 20th century .
so , i &apos;m really interested in you learning how to make your own puzzles as well as just me creating them .
( laughter ) ( applause ) so this decentralized , demystified approach of solar-electrifying villages , we &apos;ve covered all over india from ladakh up to bhutan — all solar-electrified villages by people who have been trained .
listening to this very gamma-ray burst brought us to the notion that the use of sound as an adjunctive visual display may also support sighted astronomers in the search for more information in the data .
they were too busy building a family and a country .
they actually used 6j6 , the common radio tube , because they found they were more reliable than the more expensive tubes .
what if we could , for the first time , make incredible delectables like this beautiful ted teddy here , that are edible ?
oyster reefs also covered about a quarter of our harbor and were capable of filtering water in the harbor in a matter of days .
and our goal then is to look for gases in other planet atmospheres , gases that don &apos;t belong , that we might be able to attribute to life .
you can type in an url and put in a 404 and these will pop .
when you look at a movie like &quot; &quot; jaws , &quot; &quot; the scene that you expect — we have the screen ?
four months ago , we suffered a constitutional outrage in this country .
what happened actually when dunbar kind of looked at the tape is that , in fact , almost all of the important breakthrough ideas did not happen alone in the lab , in front of the microscope .
i &apos;m supposed to be up here telling you the good news .
you know , it costs us virtually nothing to store our mind files on facebook , instagram , what-have-you .
i &apos;m not convinced that we could .

( applause ) thank you — yes , i designed the dialogue box . no , no .
this is a picture that al gore gave me a few years ago that he took when he was in the soviet union a long , long time ago , showing the fishing fleets of the aral sea .
one of the simplest facts in business is something that we often neglect , and that is that we &apos;re all human .
you are financing that phone , but you don &apos;t need to release the funds until you can verify that all the conditions have been met .
and so these characters would become my friends .
tough crowd .
can you imagine that ?
some of them were notes saying , get out .
the wackiest plan — and i &apos;m not making this up — would put what is essentially a garden hose 18-and-a-half miles high into the sky , suspended by balloons , to spew sulfur dioxide .
and the problem is the industry is supplying it .
as i place a light , i think about what it might look like in real life , but balance that out with what we need artistically and for the story .
they &apos;ve withstood untold natural perils and human encroachments , but now some of them are in jeopardy , and they can &apos;t just get up and get out of the way .
( applause ) women usually used to spend , especially in the summer months , about six to seven hours a day carrying water .
zb : every soldier eventually wants to go in combat .
not a big divergence in terms of uniform design for border guards admittedly , but in almost every other respect , it &apos;s a huge divergence .
but that rate is totally dependent upon how many problem solvers — diverse , able problem solvers — we have , and thus how many of our fellow citizens actively participate , both as entrepreneurs who can offer solutions , and as customers who consume them .
now , another great thing about necessary suffering is that it is the very thing that unites caregiver and care receiver — human beings .
so the incentives for the people helping to construct this zone and build it , and set up the basic rules , go very much in the right direction .
they have a pamphlet that says , &quot; here &apos;s what jesus said about homosexuality , &quot; and you open it up , and there &apos;s nothing in it .
number three : use open-ended questions .
and you can also tell , because of the sharp edges and the way things fit together , there are some non-linear processes .
it &apos;s a way that lets us hear the universe and hear the invisible .
i didn &apos;t know that elite universities , as research consistently tells us , are cheaper for low-income kids because these universities have bigger endowments , can offer more generous financial aid .
we were having lunch and he was telling me about when he was in jail in bali for a drug injection .
i was there because i was actually modeling the mangrove portion for a carbon credit program , under the u.n.
so whereas in the adults , as i told you , this brain region is almost completely specialized — it does almost nothing else except for thinking about other people &apos;s thoughts — in children it &apos;s much less so , when they are age five to eight , the age range of the children i just showed you .
you had to have local control because there was no nationally-available information because travel was so restricted .
and nobody can tell me no .
now , this would be a mere historical curiosity , except that in large parts of the world , this is still the truth .
they use his rhetoric .
( laughter ) that driver is looking for parking .
get out of it , get it out .
so now &apos;s the time for us to collectively stand up and say , yes , we do want to live in a world with online privacy , and yes , we can work together to turn this vision into a reality .
the continent needs you .
if people can find that that sub-prime product has been transferred across nations many , many times until it ends up in banks in iceland or the rest in britain , and people &apos;s ordinary savings are affected by it , then you cannot rely on a system of national supervision .
the kind of thing that a three- or four-year-old human , little kid could do , very hard for a computer .
and while this certainly remained the key for a cure , this seemed extraordinarily complicated to me .
and now , we &apos;re going to shoot a story in india .
as long as we live a life of curiosity and passion , there is a bit of leonardo in all of us . thank you . ( applause ) ( applause )
l.a. muscle magazine warned its readers that 40 to 50 percent of women suffer from pms , and that it plays a major role in women &apos;s mental and physical health , and a couple of years ago , even the wall street journal ran an article on calcium as a treatment for pms , asking its female readers , &quot; do you turn into a witch every month ? &quot;
it was chaotic .
i &apos;m going to talk instead about something far more interesting than dates of birth or cube roots — a little deeper and a lot closer , to my mind , than work .
we &apos;d begun to focus on new hampshire as a target for this political movement , because the primary in new hampshire is so incredibly important .
and it &apos;s my job , in the competitive process , to narrow this down .
realizes all his hair is on one side of his head .
looked like a ladybug , right ?
at that point , we &apos;ll start romanticizing the future again , instead of the nasty , brutish past .
so you have to be open to having your data shared , which is a much bigger step than just sharing your web page , or your computer .
in motivating people to love and defend the natural world , an ounce of hope is worth a ton of despair .
in fact , he didn &apos;t even bother looking at the menu .
even prime minister manmohan singh agrees with that view .
let &apos;s create a robotic vest .
a heart valve , very similar to the one that i showed you before , seven years ago , was implanted in his body .
watching her in the closet , looking for something comfortable and colorful , and tight , and safe — ( laughter ) but it &apos;s challenging to watch her negotiate her decisions looking for something that &apos;s going to get the least amount of attention , but at the same time be an expression of the vibrant and sexy woman she is .
i can swim through a lot of the pores in our earth &apos;s sponge , but where i can &apos;t , other life-forms and other materials can make that journey without me .
over the past 10 years in the uk , the return on burial plots has outperformed the uk property market by a ratio of around three to one .
one says , &quot; &quot; weapon of mass protection . &quot; &quot; we found — you know — somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction , but we have found the weapon of mass protection : the condom .
you can see the difference you make every day .
because sony music had registered chris brown &apos;s video in our content id system , within seconds of attempting to upload the video , the copy was detected , giving sony the choice of what to do next .
what if i could aim sound the way i aim light ?
the surface temperature is close to 900 degrees fahrenheit , 500 celsius .
his holiness the karmapa : tomorrow is my talk .
was i who i had been before the crash , before this road divided my life like the spine of an open book ?
so what i &apos;m trying to do instead is to bring emotions into our technology and make our technologies more responsive .
it &apos;s very , very frustrating , and i was feeling left out , like i wasn &apos;t quite gay enough .
video : austin , i hear you saying &quot; &quot; austin . &quot; &quot; ss : he talks to other bonobos at the lab , long-distance , farther than we can hear .
so i want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics .
in the nuclear age , when there were people in senior national security jobs , they were expected to speak throw-weight .
and all of them also will clear a test given on that subject .
and that is , make meadows and not lawns .
i &apos;ll use these sidewalks in rio as an example .
or you can look at different views , such as population or traffic information , but it &apos;s made physical .
and what you &apos;re looking at here is an aerial photo take over eastern oregon .
he didn &apos;t test so well , but i like him .
that in itself is a desire machine , because the incompleteness , the ambiguity , keeps you wanting that which you can &apos;t have .
so what is rogue economics ?
&quot; &quot; jó napot , pacák &quot; &quot; which , as somebody here must surely know , means &quot; &quot; what &apos;s up , guys ? &quot; &quot; in magyar , that peculiar non-indo-european language spoken by hungarians for which , given the fact that cognitive diversity is at least as threatened as biodiversity on this planet , few would have imagined much of a future even a century or two ago .
they keep it for — you know , it &apos;s like the old wine bottles , you keep it for decoration or maybe fill it with water again , which proves it &apos;s not the water .
well , it &apos;s not the lava that kills anything , it &apos;s the carbon dioxide that comes out with it .
we need mechanisms like legs and efficient motors in order to support that locomotion , and we need the sensors , power and control in order to pull everything together in a semi-intelligent ant robot .
the internet is a big chunk of that , but there is a lot more .
they come from the same neighborhoods as the population they &quot; &quot; serve . &quot; &quot; they &apos;re just normal people .
there are stories you tell from stages .
( applause ) that &apos;s it without the case on .
the steel industry is so far ahead of the design industry that if you take advantage of it you can even start to think of beams and columns all rolled together into a single system which is highly efficient , but also produces decorative effects and formal effects that are very beautiful and organic .
in angola , the chokwe people draw lines in the sand , and it &apos;s what the german mathematician euler called a graph ; we now call it an eulerian path — you can never lift your stylus from the surface and you can never go over the same line twice .
there is just one reference point , which is the body .
i became a preacher .
unfit individuals saw the distance as farther , saw the finish line as farther away , than people who were in better shape .
their name in your inbox ( laughter ) — it &apos;s all you wanted anyway .
so for the subway in new york , i saw a correspondence between riding the subway and reading .
so dearth of data in the debate is one reason .
i mean , there &apos;s a lot of people in the room who are wealthy , and they &apos;ve got kids , and we &apos;ve got this dilemma about how you bring them up .
power has a negative moral valence .
they spotted an unlocked kid &apos;s bike and a scooter on a porch and foolishly jumped on it .
there &apos;s the availability heuristic , which basically means we estimate the probability of something by how easy it is to bring instances of it to mind .
wrong again . it &apos;s now six and a half years ago since the congestion charges were introduced in stockholm , and we basically have the same low traffic levels still .
my whole 45-minute video had been silenced because there were snippets in that video , a video about fair use , that included warner music group music .
that guy &apos;s much braver than i am .
this is a way to reanimate the world , and that &apos;s what &apos;s so exciting about this perspective .
he led them to america .
it shipped every one of its computers with that game .
the worst time of day for substance abuse : 5am .
we can actually now visit our patients robotically — this is the rp7 ; if i &apos;m a hematologist , visit another clinic , visit a hospital .
like for instance , this is a google share of the ted conference .
so this , to me , is like going to the eye doctor , okay ?
so in the best case scenarios , these graduates are staffing and thus strengthening public health systems , where often they &apos;re the only doctors around .
thus , even though every civilian killed , maimed , raped , or tortured is one too many , the fact that the number of civilian casualties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago , is good news .
( laughter ) when you think about — ( applause ) when you think about the opposite of work , we , many times , think it &apos;s leisure .
but before i proceed , i should set you the context .
build our science , civilized and advanced idea of marriage and giving birth . &quot; &quot; so here , if you look at this poster , it has all the trappings of western culture .
and what &apos;s extraordinary is that we &apos;re not just observing this , we are the architects of this .
what &apos;s your vision for the next phase of this ?
well , it was wonderful . boggles my mind .
well , you know , the investors in companies like burt &apos;s bees or ben &amp; jerry &apos;s wouldn &apos;t say so .
which is why i was surprised a few months later to see her back in our own town , getting her subsequent care with her private oncologist .
there &apos;s an old african proverb that some of you know that says , &quot; &quot; if you want to go quickly , go alone ; if you want to go far , go together . &quot; &quot; we have to go far , quickly .
artists are explorers . who better to show us the city anew ?
the botanical names are in front of you .
you can see that the stream is still represented in the bottom third of the page , but notice what &apos;s missing in the top two thirds .
and where , at the nation state level that power is held to accountability subject to the rule of law , on the international stage it is not .
and then we &apos;ve got a four kilowatt-hour cell on the horizon .
a second reason has to do with peer pressure .
there &apos;s a problem with the google zeitgeist , which is it often comes back with news that a lot of people are searching for britney spears pictures , which is not necessarily news .
changing your perspective makes your mind more flexible .
and during harvest , put it back with interest , food interest .
we &apos;re going to have to do something else instead .
we &apos;re actually interviewing people on the street , in the places where they &apos;re hanging out and taking drugs .
the idea of replicating ideas ; ideas that replicate by passing from brain to brain .
and after , the children teach their parents .
but for myself , in the past , i &apos;ve spent the last 20 years studying human behavior from a rather unorthodox way : picking pockets .
now , i &apos;m a fairly slow learner , but eventually it occurred to me that maybe what passed for design wasn &apos;t all that important — making things more attractive , making them a bit easier to use , making them more marketable .
and our thinking , then , will be a hybrid of biological and non-biological thinking , but the non-biological portion is subject to my law of accelerating returns .
now , there is other origami in space .
and he was swiss .
it &apos;s easy to be honest with someone you &apos;re never going to see again , right ?
the good news , again , is that a lot of the things they need we already have , and we are very good at giving : economic assistance , not just money , but expertise , technology , knowhow , private investment , fair terms of trade , medicine , education , technical support for training for their police forces to become more effective , for their anti-terror forces to become more efficient .
imagine his name and imagine him inside the glass .
in some way the eternal god must be able to enter into the souls of human beings and experience the torment within .
i &apos;m freezing .
and here is the result : a mysterious new world , full of strange things zipping around doing things that we don &apos;t know what they &apos;re doing .
( applause ) so , all right , we &apos;ll leave them like that .
give you a little peek into our editorial notebook .
where did it come from ? who said it ?
and why would we want to do that ?
they knew all the bits and bites that they had to attack .
i started to build a prototype like that .
going to educational conferences to tell you anything about the future is solemn .
e : tweet , tweet , tweet .
so now , what do i want you to take away from this talk ?
after that work , i joined yahoo labs , and i teamed up with luca and rossano , and together , we aggregated those winning locations in london to build a new map of the city , a cartography weighted for human emotions .
i am learning some basic origami . i can make a really great box .
and this korean artisan went on to found a temple-building company .
so how does the u.s. respond to all of the above ?
here , used as a proxy , temperature variability .
now what would that look like ?
that &apos;s the financial crisis .
well , to understand that , we need to understand why cities are special , why mayors are so different than prime ministers and presidents , because my premise is that a mayor and a prime minister are at the opposite ends of a political spectrum .
i guess chris has to take some credit here , because in years past , i guess there &apos;s been some sort of subpar speakers at ted .
and granted , there may be horrible consequences for making different choices , i will give you that .
we can do that .
so , this is a map of climate in the world .
this is usually giving a compliment .
and the spider that may come out is no more threat to you than a lady bug or a butterfly .
gradually it would shift from a politics of plunder to a politics of hope . thank you .
because technology is an extension of life , it &apos;s in parallel and aligned with the same things that life wants .

you can open it up completely . it &apos;s waterproof .
i think this is what so , in fact , infuriated the scientists .
and d-rev is short for design revolution .

and those ones are actually two taxi-drivers . &quot; &quot; and then there was always a silence .
and on the other hand , accordion , the friendly bus , he carries 300 people — 275 in sweden ; 300 brazilians . ( laughter ) speaking about the design : every city has its own design .
i took this picture just two days ago .
i tell you all of this because of what i think it means for the way communities come together .
now , take turkey &apos;s gezi park protests , july 2013 , which i went back to study in the field .
mao zedong used to refer to them as the european civil wars , and it &apos;s probably a more accurate way of describing them .
i refuse to be drawn on the question of whether god exists , until somebody properly defines the terms .
and last year , the cyrus cylinder went to tehran for the second time .
do not tell me we can &apos;t do better than this .
he wants to engineer success .
and this was my fortune : &quot; you will be successful in your work . &quot;
now we &apos;re trying to ask , &quot; &quot; can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? &quot; &quot; this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma genitalium , that has the smallest genome for a species that can self-replicate in the laboratory , and we &apos;ve been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome .
so everything was framed in that way .
that way we start exposing the children from very early on , on what these issues are . because once they learn it , they will stay with it . in doing this we have created at least 100 skilled jobs in jamaica alone , and these are physicians with expertise and special training .
and you &apos;ll see in the example with the starlings , with the birds , when this peregrine hawk is about to attack them , that actually waves of panic can propagate , sending messages over great distances .
but the inverse is also true .
but let me get rid of the slide , and let &apos;s see if this comes on .
so it takes 10 or more years for any screening method to demonstrate a reduction in mortality from breast cancer .
but that &apos;s because all the young people left .
a lot of it is due to a book written by an 80-year-old man in boston , gene sharp .
at the end of their lives , they &apos;re going around each other very near the speed of light .
but these satellites that we rely on day in and day out have a finite life .
in fact , everyone at school knew the block where we lived , because it was where people came to buy weed and other drugs .
i used the word postmodern as if it were ok .
so my first topic with respect to this , was not death , but obesity .
thank you very much .
artists can take us to a far-flung part of the city that we haven &apos;t explored , or they can take us into that building that we pass every day but we never went into .
and in my little corner of the world , these two things are actually related , and i want to tell you how tonight .
my working definition of technology is &quot; &quot; anything useful that a human mind makes . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not just hammers and gadgets , like laptops .
public space . this is a good public space .
these gorillas were murdered , some would even say crucified , and unsurprisingly , they sparked international outrage .
all of a sudden , artists could sample from anything and everything that came before them , from a snare drum from the funky meters , to a ron carter bassline , the theme to &quot; &quot; the price is right . &quot; &quot; albums like de la soul &apos;s &quot; &quot; 3 feet high and rising &quot; &quot; and the beastie boys &apos; &quot; &quot; paul &apos;s boutique &quot; &quot; looted from decades of recorded music to create these sonic , layered masterpieces that were basically the sgt. peppers of their day .

we would finally have a way to give them feedback , as well as the means to act on it .
we are essentially burning the airfoil as we fly it .
tropical forests contain a huge amount of carbon in the trees , and we need to keep that carbon in those forests if we &apos;re going to avoid any further global warming .
and i will take kenya as an example .
he risked his life as he walked up to people whose families he &apos;d murdered .
states mean less than they used to , and the power of the state is declining .
this is a proud member of protei from korea , and on the right side , this is a multiple-masts design proposed by a team in mexico .

and the reason that it rises in a defective form is because early in the baby &apos;s brain &apos;s life the machine process is noisy .
that &apos;s where we are today : 61 out of 100 .
but that they &apos;re really all market driven , and what &apos;s driving the market in particular — number one — is major demographic shifts .
and so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18-wheeler trailer , and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples .
so it &apos;s a homeless pigeon now and it &apos;s going to have to find another place to live , and that allows me to go through my catalog of favorite things , and we start with the tall ones and so on .
and it wasn &apos;t just to that wine .

this is an actual group of people that sit around naming planetary objects .
( video ) boy : hey listen ! did you know that the stocks are up ?
so many years ago , you may remember that former president ronald reagan was very criticized for making a statement that facts are stupid things .
he would say things like — hp : empty your mind .
so we started to think : is this the agent that might have been present in the skier , and might have she had more of it than someone else , and might that have been able to reduce her demand for oxygen before she got so cold that she otherwise would have died , as we found out with our worm experiments ?
you &apos;ll buy gps dots in bulk , and you &apos;ll stick them on everything you own worth more than a few tens of dollars .
( laughter ) what i &apos;m going to tell you about in my 18 minutes is how we &apos;re about to switch from reading the genetic code to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves .
so we are bridging the digital divide .
the company had lots of alternatives ; they had power .

even though that spirit bear moment was powerful , i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll ever have another experience like i did with these leopard seals .
government , well , one thing that comes to mind is the u.s. government , among others , is literally starting to pay people to lose weight .
the first gentleman , he &apos;s a baker .
and i think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this .
and you know why they agreed ? they agreed to humor him .
so i thought a little box set of four small books might do the trick .
music must be the thing for derek .
we &apos;ve only just begun exploring other possible uses for this new technology .
now there &apos;s a solution to all these problems .
what is this ? this is the first transplant of naked dna , where you take an entire dna operating system out of one cell , insert it into a different cell , and have that cell boot up as a separate species . that &apos;s one month old . you will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff .
and the little girl who arises out of their union will of course be not korean or german or french or thai or scotch or canadian or even american , but a wonderful and constantly evolving mix of all those places .
so , from my point of view , it &apos;s important to publish it , but at the same time it does cause a confusion — intentional on my behalf , but problematic for any outlet that i &apos;m working with .
we said to her , &quot; &quot; are you worried ? are you upset ? &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; no , because we &apos;ve got hope now .
you see the contrast between the rich and poor .
they embrace their trauma and hardships as key elements of who they &apos;ve become , and know that without those experiences , they might not have developed the muscle and grit required to become successful .
just 20 years ago , that lake didn &apos;t exist .
learning about the natural world is one thing ; learning from the natural world — that &apos;s the switch .
it recently came out that experts trialing drugs before they come to market typically trial drugs first , primarily on male animals and then , primarily on men .
i &apos;ve got a friend named layla who was born and raised in ghana .
you know , because — and by the way to i was so grateful to dean kamen for pointing out that one of the reasons , that there are cultural reasons that women and minorities don &apos;t enter the fields of science and technology — because for instance , the reason i don &apos;t do math is , i was taught to do math and read at the same time .
i was proud to be part of that work , and it changed the laws and it put millions of dollars into local communities .
there &apos;s carbon that &apos;s being bought with sugar , with coffee , with beef .
thank you and god bless you .
but ultimately you &apos;re going to civilianize it , probably two thirds .
and so as we see in this image of light during the night , there are lots of areas of the earth where human development is much greater and other areas where it &apos;s much less , but between them we see large dark areas of relatively unexplored ocean .
and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m saying .
that &apos;s caused a literal revolution , and it &apos;s opened us up to a new experimental preparation . neurobiologists , as you well know , have lots of experimental preps , worms and rodents and fruit flies and things like this .
i flew off to a place that &apos;s been shrouded in mystery for centuries , a place some folks call shangri-la .
i &apos;m going to start really , really simply .
and that &apos;s why we &apos;re talking about sneakers .
i would like to share with you this morning some stories about the ocean through my work as a still photographer for national geographic magazine .
i built this bar with my bare hands from the finest wood in the county .
one of the greatest studies that we &apos;ve been finding is that many times investors would ask this question — &quot; &quot; what is a scalable model ? &quot; &quot; — as if the need of a community , which is only located in a space and time and has those needs only located in those places , has no legitimate right to get them for free because it &apos;s not part of a larger scale .
i think of this as the place of imagination , of potential , but what are its qualities ?
seafood has a really complex supply chain , and at every step in this supply chain , there &apos;s an opportunity for seafood fraud , unless we have traceability .
humans not only can feel grief , we create an awful lot of it .
and these 22 units — still the richest people use most of it .
and this group was no different .
( laughter ) in the privacy of my room , covered in sawdust , i would saw , trim and polish wood all night long until a bow took shape .
these people — in my , symbol-obsessed , twelve year-old imagination — these people who are strangling themselves as one of the first things they do each morning , they can &apos;t possibly be happy .
&quot; &quot; excuse me ? &quot; &quot; raisuddin answers .
as john sits on dan &apos;s bed , a train goes rushing by , rattling everything in the room .
we realized that designing these templates allowed us to give shape to raw silk without boiling a single cocoon .
you need clear , open visibility of what the best people in that crowd are capable of , because that is how you will learn how you will be empowered to participate .
they can afford to watch their &quot; &quot; robocop &quot; &quot; and whatever .
i &apos;m going to show film , i need the enormous screen .
but the divine one was unjust , so the gods said , &quot; &quot; ok , what we need to do is help the just one . &quot; &quot; and so they helped the just one .
two more we &apos;re going to throw away directly into bins .
the goal is not just to hire people who need a job ; it &apos;s to hire people who believe what you believe .
and again , here , you see barbie.com , but also , very quickly , adiosbarbie.com , the body image for every size . a contested cultural object , which you won &apos;t find anywhere soon on overture , which is the classic market-based mechanism : whoever pays the most is highest on the list .
( laughter ) this is , of course , the cartesian coordinates .
in cites , about 80 percent of people have someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race , but in rural communities , only about 30 percent .
but it does mean persisting in the face of their inevitable annoyance when , for example , we want them to explain things to us in language that we can actually understand .
but then again , it &apos;s on my list of didactic posters .
they want to get back to slower rhythms .
you can earn 60 euros . isn &apos;t that great ? yes or no ? &quot; &quot; no reply . like , a huge proportion of them couldn &apos;t be bothered after they had just started , they just signed up , to reply .
because there &apos;s another way of seeing it .
if the sound is the taste , then reverb is sort of like the smell of the sound .
and before you say it &apos;s a norman foster design , we designed this in &apos; 83 .
( laughter ) but nonetheless , not just the dutch , but everyone has this desire for the authentic .
even if you want to have some gathering , before you go there , the police are already waiting for you .
we can disseminate .
these stories show that mathematics is able to make us go out of our intuition measure the earth which seems infinite , see atoms which are invisible or detect an imperceptible variation of shape .
christopher &apos;s case was a serious one and it needed to be dealt with as such , but i didn &apos;t think branding him a felon for the rest of his life was the right answer .
so i turned to science .
lg : ten of diamonds , yeah .
they ran around corners , they went up sides of buildings , and they melded into the architecture .
to see a vision of the universe that &apos;s more perfect than our own .
so maybe it &apos;s working in people the same way .
the toolbox exists .
you want a separate thing , like the ac adaptor .
and there are several teams in the world that do exactly that , especially at epfl .
the talk will be broadly about energy , but oil &apos;s a good place to start .
and there are amazing things you can do with breathing , with posture , and with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice .
we can reach them . there are paths that enable us to reach them .
you want to see god .
today , many of the biological sciences only see value in studying deeper what we already know — in mapping already-discovered continents .
other countries come with different things .
this one said , &quot; &quot; yield : one ejaculate . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) there &apos;s another way that orgasm might boost fertility .
so they did it with mouse pups , kittens .
you know , so when you leave living rooms in europe , people say , thankfully , nobody was ironic in your presence .
everyone who participates in this global exchange of ideas , whether it &apos;s here in this room or just outside this room or online or locally , where everybody lives , everyone who stands up to injustice and inequality , everybody who stands up to those who preach racism rather than empathy , dogma rather than critical thinking , technocracy rather than democracy , everyone who stands up to the unchecked power , whether it &apos;s authoritarian leaders , plutocrats hiding their assets in tax havens , or powerful lobbies protecting the powerful few .
you know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment , how they &apos;ve been sold over the last 40 years ?
at first i saw it , and i said , okay , it &apos;s a huge file . okay .
and when i present this in africa — nairobi , lagos , accra — i get one question .
i was 18 years old and bored , and i picked up a book in the library on bees and i spent the night reading it .
i see an entire weekend .
each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns .
so our next question then was , how are they doing this ?
you should see the rubbish — ( applause ) — you should see the rubbish that we have bestowed on unsuspecting african people .
within weeks , our national congress approved the disarmament bill that had been languishing for years .
i think you can get change .
you can &apos;t raise money .
increasingly , we &apos;re using mobile devices , and we interact on the go .
and then we look at what companies can do .
and we do the opposite — the bigger we are , the more rules we create .
do they have rights , freedom of choice , freedom from discrimination and access to the the world &apos;s most advanced knowledge ?
and this was the preparation that i was being given after 17 years as a child of the state .
and the other key thing that we did was make this box run off a usb key , because we realized that even though there was gprs and all that on paper , at least , in theory , it was much more efficient to send the data on a little usb key by surface mail .
well , we know that these juveniles make nasty-tasting chemicals that help them survive their extended childhood , so we think these lights first evolved as a warning , a neon sign that says , &quot; &quot; toxic ! stay away ! &quot; &quot; to any would-be predators .
and they should make sure that when you walk into a museum — if i was a museum curator , i would make a room for love , a room for generosity .
and the result is sort of gratifyingly perpetual .
but i think that it &apos;s so good — it doesn &apos;t smell , we can put it in our house , we can lock it behind a door — and i think we &apos;ve locked it out of conversation too .
these survivors don &apos;t need saving .
they &apos;ve been embracing hacking as a law enforcement technique , but without any real debate .

the y chromosome , the piece of dna that makes men men , traces a purely paternal line of descent .
they did it within two or three degrees of the pole , to maintain similarity between continents .
and no one wanted to be responsible for it .
people talked about it twice less as it should have been .
in this case , harry ramos , who was the head trader at an investment bank , who stopped to aid victor wald on the 55th floor of the south tower .
we could hit them with a weapon that we understood but they didn &apos;t — a social media shaming .
and he invited us in particular because we have a very specific type of design process — one that results in appropriate design solutions in places that don &apos;t usually have access to design services or creative capital .
it &apos;s about two meters by three , and you are all welcome any time .
kick it out of the way . throw it into the audience . whoom .
but i also felt like i saw more animals working with the tiburon than the ventana , two vehicles with the same field of view but different propulsion systems .
because i believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choosy about choosing .
they would blend right into the algae , which would also fluoresce red , but they &apos;ve got great vision , and they go through this long mating ritual , and perhaps they &apos;re using it in that effect .
we are a soul .
if we travel back in time 20,000 years ago , the earth looked very much different .
i thought , maybe there &apos;s some earthly basis for moral decisions .
and in its place , we &apos;d have the opposite of read-write culture , what we could call read-only culture .
but when i talk about my daughter , the word i find myself saying most is &quot; &quot; athlete . &quot; &quot; my kid &apos;s athletic .
and yet all the while , still , we continue in the same vein , the same vein that contradicts everything that we just admitted .
and jeff came up beside me and said , &quot; so , have you ever been cow tipping ? &quot;
and then there are those whose marriages are actually a veil for prostitution .
and in fact , because their minds don &apos;t fit into society &apos;s version of normal , they &apos;re often bypassed and misunderstood .
and when i made my way to that piping chimney i &apos;d seen in the distance , i saw hanna zavorotnya , and i met her .
and i believe soon .
in fact , the drops that were different in a way that caused them to be better at incorporating chemicals around them , grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more .
but it was a terrific job .
so i &apos;m going to do it too . we &apos;ll all be there together .
they were able to think outside the box because their box was full of holes .
we wake up in the morning and we open the closet ; we feel that we decide what to wear .
and we do about 300,000 .
great movement that is starting billions of years ago is moving through us and it continues to go , and our choice , so to speak , in technology , is really to align ourselves with this force much greater than ourselves .
we think there &apos;s a future to this . but it &apos;s our way of going in and redefining , with a new lexicon , a mathematical one actually , as opposed to the standard ways that we think about mental illness , characterizing these diseases , by using the people as birds in the exchanges . that is , we exploit the fact that the healthy partner , playing somebody with major depression , or playing somebody with autism spectrum disorder , or playing somebody with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , we use that as a kind of biosensor , and then we use computer programs to model that person , and it gives us a kind of assay of this .
this is kind of like an undersea rooster .
come on .
now — and i think since the public theater , i must have done more than a dozen cultural identities for major institutions , and i don &apos;t think i ever — i ever grasped that seriousness again — i do them for very big , important institutions in new york city .
by forgiving stroman publicly in the name of islam and its doctrine of mercy .
the second benefit of using our senses has to do with intimacy .

i lived in new york for 10 years , and i am a big fan of &quot; &quot; sex and the city . &quot; &quot; now i &apos;d love to watch the first movie again as sort of a warm-up to the sequel coming out next week .

we published articles in finance journals .
but it &apos;s actually not a new field .
it has been five years since lars was with us , and in that time , his family has welcomed a daughter and another son .
( laughter ) so , here are these women , who never discuss their period with their husbands , and here i am telling them , &quot; &quot; well , how often do you get your period ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and , &quot; &quot; do you notice any discharges ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and , &quot; &quot; how swollen is your vulva ? &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) she never would have thought of herself as a feminist , my mother , but she always used to say , &quot; anything a man can do , i can fix . &quot;
shuffle tracking means i keep track of the cards , even if another person shuffles .
how do you solve this problem ?
dh : thank you very much !
we &apos;ve gone from having to hide our sexuality in order to maintain our jobs and our families to literally getting a place at the table with the president and a shout out at his second inauguration .
so i felt enormous pity for fide &apos;s family .
sarkozy suggested that world leaders should stop myopically focusing on gdp and consider a new index , what some french are calling a &quot; &quot; joie de vivre index . &quot; &quot; i like it .

he literally had nothing . he was a virtual skeleton , yet he could still summon the courage and the will to move .
and it &apos;s already written down — so , like , if you &apos;re driving , you don &apos;t have to do one of these things , &quot; &quot; uh huh , uh huh , uh huh . &quot; &quot; it works with weather , too .
what if we start thinking about them as financial assets ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;ve got really weird payoff structures and all that , but let &apos;s throw everything we know about financial engineering at them .
i &apos;ve seen this video , but i still don &apos;t know if it &apos;s going to end right .
and when you get a radical innovation , it &apos;s often very uncertain how it can be applied .
what if the entire boat becomes a point of control ?
mr : well , chris , what we &apos;re working on is creating a situation where people can create a mind file , and a mind file is the collection of their mannerisms , personality , recollection , feelings , beliefs , attitudes and values , everything that we &apos;ve poured today into google , into amazon , into facebook , and all of this information stored there will be able , in the next couple decades , once software is able to recapitulate consciousness , be able to revive the consciousness which is imminent in our mind file .
so many reactions involving enzymes and proteins are sensitive to the acid content of the ocean .
now , it &apos;s not because the vaccines are not there — they are there and they are free — and it &apos;s not because parents do not care about their kids .
( applause ) bruno giussani : thank you , francesco . give me that to start so we don &apos;t forget .

they &apos;ll tell you that the natural dead body of your mother or father is not good enough as it is .
in fact , i &apos;ve never found anybody that doesn &apos;t like the light that goes out slowly .
and everyone was doing the same .
and it &apos;s one of the nicest pieces i &apos;ve ever made , i think .
think of models of terrorism , child kidnapping , airline safety , car safety .
compare those two pictures , and now as a radiologist , you can essentially fly through your patient &apos;s colon and , augmenting that with artificial intelligence , identify potentially , as you see here , a lesion .
we began , perhaps 5,000 years ago , with writing .

she &apos;s waiting for the market to open a little impatiently .
and we want all internet users or internet site owners to make their sites compatible so that we persons without vision can have a level playing field .
there are people who worry about this , and in fact , i , myself , apparently , was denounced on national tv a couple of nights ago because of an op-ed i &apos;d written .
how about a toy with cola ?
and i came outside , and the valets for this car service had created , you know , quite a nice little collage of these car keys , and my closest equivalent were a group of prayer tags that i had seen in tokyo .
i have learned a lot from people like najmuddin , mahmoud , rafi .
they &apos;re relevant for all sorts of different activities .
but if you send in a fake gps signal , another peak pops up , and if you can get these two peaks perfectly aligned , the tracking points can &apos;t tell the difference , and they get hijacked by the stronger counterfeit signal , with the authentic peak getting forced off .
so if he &apos;s successful , she won &apos;t be the last .
what is better when we &apos;re talking about a human being ?
so i first went to copenhagen because i thought , well , maybe i could become a biochemist , but i discovered biochemistry was very boring .
one of my favorite educators , brazilian author and scholar paulo freire , speaks quite explicitly about the need for education to be used as a tool for critical awakening and shared humanity .
please don &apos;t tell me i &apos;m normal .
early filer and late filer . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) the next day i came to see him . i was like , &quot; &quot; doctor , that was a really good joke . &quot; &quot; and he was like , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re the writer , kid . &quot; &quot; anyway — so they had just turned three , and they came and they were doing this dance they had just made up where they were twirling faster and faster until they tumbled to the ground , laughing with all the glee in the world .
schizophrenia is a brain disease .
when i first got on that plane for somalia as a young doctor , i had no idea what it meant to live with war .
he didn &apos;t lead with his chest , which requires you lean forward .

we need to get the energy into the robot and we need to treat the pollution , so the pollution goes in , and it will do something .
we had — we were being attacked by british airways .
just quickly : aristotle , his thing was , &quot; &quot; it ’ s not flat , stupid , it ’ s round . &quot; &quot; galileo — he had the inquisition , so he had to be a little bit more polite — his was , &quot; &quot; it ’ s not in the middle , you know . &quot; &quot; and hawkes : &quot; &quot; it ’ s not earth , stupid , it ’ s ocean . &quot; &quot; this is an ocean planet .
there are so many things you could do . you could pay for uniforms , you could eliminate fees , you could build latrines , you could give girls sanitary pads , etc . , etc .
these are hopping microbot swarms .
the experiment is this : is it possible to have institutions in our country , universities , where people from all backgrounds can come and learn and learn to work together and learn to become leaders and to support each other in that experience ?
when a bird lands on it , they trigger a sound file .

so , that answers that sort of first question i was talking about .

if we go on increasing those concentrations , we risk temperatures over the next century or so that we have not seen on this planet for tens of millions of years .
you don &apos;t know me . i don &apos;t know you .
that is the torah and everything else is only commentary . &quot; &quot; and the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that any interpretation of scripture that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate .
you &apos;ll notice that transportation &apos;s sort of second down that list , but that &apos;s the conversation we mostly hear about .
( laughter ) it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t like other paleontologists .
fungi multiplied . orchids emerged , genitalia shaped to lure insects ...
and we &apos;ve got a production unit in oxford , or just south of oxford , where we actually produce these mosquitos .
well , obviously the next thing to do was build a cannon .
in america , not so much .

pink &apos;s squad and another squad spent their entire day outside the wire .
sweden achieved a low child mortality because we started early .

feed your head , feed your head , feed your head . &quot; &quot; ( music ) ph : by this time , computing had kind of leapt into media territory , and in short order much of what we &apos;re doing today was imagined in cambridge and silicon valley .
well , that &apos;s because you &apos;ve got receptors in your skin , touch and pain receptors , going back into your brain and saying &quot; &quot; don &apos;t worry , you &apos;re not being touched .
strangely enough , 30 years later , we &apos;re building 1-800-got-junk ?
you all have a piece of cardboard and a piece of paper .

the reason women like it so much in africa is they can hide it from their husbands , who sometimes want a lot of children .
this was more of a feasibility study : what kind of motors should we use ?
but there &apos;s not a lot of science behind that number .
why ? because they were old and infirm , and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything .
you &apos;ll see broad bacterial groups , and if you look at the shape of this pink lobe , it tells you something about the relative abundance of each group .
but most importantly , i think , we really wanted to make an experience that was unlike the johnny cash project , where you had a small group of people spending a lot of time to contribute something for everyone .
and the poem goes : &quot; &quot; on the idle hill of summer , lazy with the flow of streams , hark i hear a distant drummer , drumming like a sound in dreams , far and near and low and louder on the roads of earth go by , dear to friend and food to powder , soldiers marching , soon to die . &quot; &quot; those who are interested in poetry , the poem is &quot; &quot; a shropshire lad &quot; &quot; written by a.e. housman .

now , then , this was a horrible misunderstanding of tv on the part of the programmers .
the task of our time , one of the great tasks of our time , is to build a global society , as i said , where people can live together in peace .
and i looked like this .
and i said to professor kurokawa , &quot; &quot; wow , the architects must have really been kicking themselves when they realized that they &apos;d made a mistake and put this one upside down . &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; no , no , no . it was a very deliberate act . &quot; &quot; and he referred me to this lovely quote from the japanese &quot; &quot; essays in idleness &quot; &quot; from the 14th century , in which the essayist wrote , &quot; &quot; in everything , uniformity is undesirable .
he was taken to another province , where he was forced to work as a sex slave for the warlord and his friends .
we actually write it only to set our attitudes right .

bees have been dying over the last 50 years , and we &apos;re planting more crops that need them .
but here and there and that . you know what to do .

in 2008 , lancet compiled all the research and put forward the compelling evidence that if a child in its first thousand days — from conception to two years old — does not have adequate nutrition , the damage is irreversible .
that &apos;s why india belongs at ted , and that &apos;s why ted belongs in india .
i have phlebitis at the moment , in both legs , and that &apos;s the reason that i had to have a little help in getting up here , because i have parkinson &apos;s disease in addition to that , and some other problems that i won &apos;t talk about .
and we found some remarkable differences .
now to move and to balance , rezero needs to turn the ball .
what we &apos;re doing is we are seizing control of our evolutionary future .
as a 10-year-old , along with my siblings , i dreamt of scraping off the poison from fly-killer paper into his coffee , grounded down glass and sprinkling it over his breakfast , loosening the carpet on the stairs so he would trip and break his neck .
we tend to stereotype victims as grisly headlines , self-destructive women , damaged goods .
and governments have not been able to provide clean water .
i didn &apos;t tell tony that . i didn &apos;t tell the pilots that .
and we think once people see these films , they &apos;ll have a much better understanding of that part of the world and the middle east in general .
what about a nervous system for the things that we make ?
if you do this again and again , the propensity , the tendencies for anger to arise again will be less and less each time you dissolve it .
and so the first idea here is just to show you the kind of things that children do .
thank you .
&quot; &quot; huckleberry finn &quot; &quot; has one in dialect .
and here they had a chance to rebuild cities from the bottom up , but somehow were not connecting with them .
let &apos;s look at the next conductor , richard strauss .
( laughter ) i &apos;m talking about all companies .
and times square in new york is literally the crossroads of the world .
a low entropy configuration is one in which there &apos;s only a few arrangements that look that way .
they &apos;re part of your life . they &apos;re not necessarily a separate thing .
we have sensations and experiences as well .
so i had always thought , you know , &quot; &quot; you change your mind , and you change your behavior , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s often the other way around .
now , psychoanalysts know very well that people surprisingly don &apos;t have passion for knowledge but passion for ignorance .
we reminded them that when businesses pay workers a living wage , taxpayers are relieved of the burden of funding the poverty programs like food stamps and medical assistance and rent assistance that those workers need .
and these are the references that we have in any city .
does canada have its own consciousness ?
looking at limitations as a source of creativity changed the course of my life .
this is a bio-morphic building .
i know the people who worked on the treo .
you obviously heard what happened , what the treatment that bradley manning got , chelsea manning as now is , and there was a story in buzzfeed saying that there are people in the intelligence community who want you dead .
but most of the world in the middle are pushing forwards very fast .
my mom taught me to dance when i was five , and my dad taught me to play fiddle when i was nine .
we talk of people as human capital .
the first is collaboration .
you don &apos;t believe me ?
and they tell us that even if we do it by astrology , they ’ re happy .
and then the super-sizing of our other civic institutions like playing fields — it &apos;s wonderful that westin in the ft . lauderdale area has eight soccer fields and eight baseball diamonds and 20 tennis courts , but look at the road that takes you to that location , and would you let your child bike on it ?
you see that ethnobotanists have friends in all sorts of strange cultures .
pretty much everywhere , the fields and forests , the mangroves and meadows that fireflies need to survive , are giving way to development and to sprawl .
what are the elements that will most affect your ideas and decisions ?
you know , we &apos;re criticized abroad for believing we &apos;re the saviors of the world in some way , but the flip side of it is that , actually , when people do see what is happening abroad and people &apos;s reactions to some of our policy abroad , we feel this power , that we need to — we feel like we have to get the power to change things .
and that is wrong . &quot; &quot; what would you say to them ?
people hate number ten like they hate uni , actually .
when we can communicate from the inside out , we &apos;re talking directly to the part of the brain that controls behavior , and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do .
and this information is out there .
let &apos;s live in a world where the shamans live in these forests and heal themselves and us with their mystical plants and their sacred frogs .
one day , we received a call about a seven-year-old child choking from a hot dog .
the day after our son was born , the pediatrician came into the hospital room and said she was concerned .
i oppose it — that they are now going to dissect it , until i do my report and then i see the chief commander .
and this groove right here , comes from the crescent city , the old second line .
right along the fence line .
the picture i &apos;m about to show you is a compelling picture .
more than half of those extra sdrs that were printed in 2009 — 150 billion dollars &apos; worth — went to developed market countries who , for the most part , have a modest need for these foreign exchange reserves , because they have flexible exchange rates .
a lot of it didn &apos;t pan out .
giving up the fight — for that &apos;s how it felt , it felt like giving up — meant giving up not only his life but also our story , our story of us as fighters , the story of us as invincible , and for the doctors , the story of themselves as healers .
ts : thank you , john .
we &apos;re here , we &apos;re part of a community , sharing out ideas and discussing them .
and not only do the refugees live in very dramatic circumstances inside those countries , but the local communities themselves are suffering , because salaries went down , because there are more unemployed , because prices and rents went up .
it really is a little bit out of place temporally .
they came upon a suite on the top floor of the hotel , and they kicked down the door and they found a man hiding by his bed .
even though it looks like they &apos;re thinking as a group , they &apos;re not .
or , if you &apos;re carol , you could lure your ex-boyfriend into some empty parking lot where the police are waiting for him .
nothing ventured , nothing gained .
but here &apos;s the problem : sometimes patients become resistant to the drug , and then years after they &apos;ve been declared to be cancer free , they come back .
so i put it through a g.c. , a gas chromatograph that i have in my office , and it ’ s about 400 .
one such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the a.i. dupont institute in wilmington , delaware .
and we were able to dig up , when we got old enough , fossils such as this , a slender-snouted crocodile .
the lives of the elderly are widely recognized as constituting a disaster area of modern american society .
and it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of language , and how what we call people so often distances us from them , and makes them little .
because when we see someone walks , we see the footprint .
but they &apos;re also vulnerable , vulnerable not only to natural disturbances like bark beetles that preferentially attack big old trees but high-grade logging and clear-cut logging .
what i am trying to do as a photographer , as an artist , is to bring the world of art and science together .
we know what happened over the 20th century .
so i &apos;m currently working on a book , which plays with both senses of the word , as i explore some of my own ideas and inquiries in a visual display of rather peacock-like grandeur .
so this was the model which actually came out — very amazing .
it &apos;s a pretty simple idea , right ?
or , even more powerful in film , morgan freeman .
so it might be very natural to feel demoralized and defeated after you fail .
or if a dinner guest after the meal pulled out his wallet and offered to pay you for the meal , that would be rather awkward as well .
and then think about what it also means for other decisions in your life , and hopefully also for policy questions that affect all of us .
that &apos;s the way loudspeakers pretty much are .
we &apos;re looking for this behavior among white voters or , really , non-black voters .
we can turn data into a time-lapse view of a global economy in motion .
a few days later , i woke with an idea of how i might give them that voice .
ka : last year , bear vasquez posted this video that he had shot outside his home in yosemite national park .
lots of people resigned from well-paid jobs and jumped into the national movement .
it &apos;s a model we built for bali .
ma : you gotta have doorstops . that &apos;s important .
( laughter ) and in fact , he found that in three quarters of the men the stuff just kind of slopped out .
( laughter ) so — so , my goal in life was to do stuff that wasn &apos;t made out of helvetica .
ju : it &apos;s been a great pleasure .
in fact this isn &apos;t just abstract .
i have patients who would benefit from this .
and you can understand , obviously , the transmission problem between people in high-virus areas .
i then scheduled the physical exam for two weeks hence , and when the patient came for the physical , i was able to do a thorough physical , because i had nothing else to do .
&quot; &quot; punk farm &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; lunch lady &quot; &quot; are in development to be movies , so i am a movie producer and i really do think , thanks to that video camera i was given in ninth grade .
now think what this means .
in 2002 , we started a new institute , the institute for biological energy alternatives , where we set out two goals : one , to understand the impact of our technology on the environment , and how to understand the environment better , and two , to start down this process of making synthetic life to understand basic life .
one day soon after that — it was a friday — at the end of the day , i went down — i was going down to the subway . it was rush hour and thousands of people were streaming down the stairs .
it has a big serration on the edge .
and we invite you to participate . thank you very much .
they use it for finding food , for attracting mates , for defending against predators .
he puts out his tongue in order to remove the maggots , so as not to harm them .
that puts a lot of pressure on greenland .
it &apos;s limited in capacity , limited in duration , limited in focus .
so here &apos;s a little pink one , a little pouf on his head .
so finally , texture is something .
in terms of dark matter , i said that we don &apos;t have any , you know , really persuasive argument for dark energy .
there are two of these .
would it open up beneath my bed and swallow me as i slept ?
and the thing is , is that oil is really an abstraction for us as the american consumer .
and on the sweet spot on the stage , tatum starts playing ...
a billion of us are obese , while a further billion starve .
and in fact , i know , i &apos;m very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job .
i wasn &apos;t the only one .
so that &apos;s a good thing .
and from that point , i learned how to pull the mic away and attack the poetry with my body .
i &apos;m a tester guy . i believe you need data , you need information , because you work at something , you think it &apos;s working , and you find out it &apos;s not working .
the first one is that just because something has worked in the past so well , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s going to work in the future .
and he made this statement that was so profound to me .
and so disseminating that information to around the rest of africa is important .
this second story tells us everything about how we got here and where we need to go next .
and that of course defeats the object of the exercise .
by the end of this year , you &apos;ll be able to drive from l.a. to new york just using the supercharger network , which charges at five times the rate of anything else .
let me bring it to you locally .
pm : gabby , what &apos;s been the toughest challenge for you during this recovery ?
we hid behind cars , running through the darkness that lay between the streetlights , boundless laughter ubiquitous across the pavement .
however , to my surprise , i discovered that dictatorships do not crumble so easily .
so i think when it comes to markets , we have a little bit of a similar fable in our heads .
and i started to be one of those people who felt that computers are boring and technical and lonely .
so i thought , i &apos;ve got to compose myself for troy .
someone &apos;s offering 10 million dollars to go and do this thing .
we can all think of someone , often a young woman , who has been impacted by breast cancer .
and they found that when people with high expectations succeed , they attribute that success to their own traits .
the good news is , that &apos;s starting to happen .
so this is an important change , and it &apos;s interesting to see that wealth inequality has not fully recovered to pre-world war i levels , although the total quantity of wealth has recovered .
two days later , i got a response from dr. arupa ganguly of the university of pennsylvania .
with the help of iit , teri , and learnings from nasa , we discovered that there are three basic green plants , common green plants , with which we can grow all the fresh air we need indoors to keep us healthy .
on much of the planet , most meat animals get antibiotics every day of their lives , not to cure illnesses , but to fatten them up and to protect them against the factory farm conditions they are raised in .
he was also the ultimate self-learner , and like everything else , he did it in grand style .
this was when we had our &quot; &quot; aha ! &quot; &quot; this was the breakthrough .
and if you get a chance , you can go to our website , and you &apos;ll see the incredible work these kids do .
i won &apos;t be with my family in the eternities .
and among the answers that you can get from this skeleton are included : first , this skeleton documents , for the first time , how infants looked over three million years ago .
this reduced their fuel consumption by about 30 percent , which saved them money , and at the same time , it had a significant benefit for whales .
one of the things they used to do is they used to bring in the wife or the daughter of the donor so the donee could tell the doctors , &quot; &quot; do you recognize this person ? do you love this person ?
and maybe if you come back to a close , cohesive , tribal society , you can get over trauma pretty quickly .
stop signs were invented in 1915 , yield signs in 1950 . but that &apos;s all we got .
now , there is a big problem behind all this behavior that we have seen .
so she &apos;s really the driving force behind the development of graphics-processing units .
but then , to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria that live on the earth , we &apos;ve also made pro-quorum sensing molecules .
so with my friend marco , we decided to go there and see who are the real palestinians and who are the real israelis .
so we need to do something active .
what &apos;s in this picture ?
and i think that really exemplifies the challenge that we &apos;re dealing with here .
and if my heart is singing , it &apos;s because in these little fragments , every now and again , you catch a glimpse of a whole , of a whole new world .
and i actually got certified in a pool at a ymca in the dead of winter in buffalo , new york .
and in the upper right you see this black sort of cloud moving ashore .
that &apos;s like comparing how fast i run to the speed of light .
when the portuguese arrived in latin america about 500 years ago , they obviously found this amazing tropical forest .
in vr , i can give that to you .
if we put a good copy of the dopamine receptor back in this elliptical structure called the central complex , the flies are no longer hyperactive , but they still can &apos;t learn .
representative government began to form .
we use game dynamics to build on it . we build with mindshare .
now , i know some of you in this room find this to be a risky proposition .
and they will conclude that the universe is static and unchanging and populated by a single central oasis of matter that they inhabit — a picture of the cosmos that we definitively know to be wrong .
and of course , nothing succeeds like success ; the cynics then turned around , and one after the other they also started saying , &quot; &quot; yes , we also want to make a car in the nano segment .
but managing the tourism market in a way that can really benefit the people is very important .
and you can see how dense the population is .
but that &apos;s not going to be the only answer .
the problem is that as long as the economic and the political spheres are separate , automation makes the twin peaks taller , the waste loftier and the social conflicts deeper , including — soon , i believe — in places like china .
and with those 1.5 million cases , which is the largest data set on pretrial in the united states today , we were able to basically find that there were 900-plus risk factors that we could look at to try to figure out what mattered most .
this is a glass beaker after about half a million rads of radiation .
the internet has played a great role , helping these people to speak up their minds , to collaborate together , to start thinking together .
i went to the dark side , and i just indulged myself .
bg : but i think what surprised many people is it &apos;s not only sudden , but it wasn &apos;t supposed to be sudden .
for example , new york passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure decision for the teachers .
women , back in the late 19th century , spent two days a week doing the laundry .
and that &apos;s something that &apos;s just profound and sad , but astonishing because so many of us don &apos;t actually know this .
i was running , as chris said , to be the ceo of a large software company called sap and then peres said , &quot; &quot; well won &apos;t you run this project ? &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m ready for ceo &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; oh no no no no no . you &apos;ve got to explain to me , what is more important than saving your country and saving the world , that you would go and do ? &quot; &quot; and i had to quit and come and do this thing called a better place .
lg : for a long time , researchers in emerging diseases were kind of dismissive of the pandemic flu threat on the grounds that back in 1918 they didn &apos;t have antibiotics .
and you &apos;ll see that it leads with a shifting star field , and there &apos;s an aurora borealis in the background , kind of morphing with color . the color of the aurora borealis can be controlled using this single bar of color at the bottom , and we &apos;ll put it down here to red .
all countries spy .
tell the clocks to stop .
my colleagues , iravatham mahadevan and asko parpola , have been making some headway on this particular problem .
the other thing we discovered was an area that was overactive , area 25 , seen there in red , and area 25 is the sadness center of the brain .
and she put her head back and she said , &quot; it feels like leaping into heaven . &quot;
now , when i heard about one animal , i knew we had to get it for my next series , untamed americas , for national geographic .
it &apos;s so important that the very tools we use to understand ourselves , to understand the world around us , are shaped by that stance .
and so maybe one day , waffle house will hire me , after practicing on it some more .
the truth of the matter is otherwise .
it can change our world in immensely important ways , because if you &apos;re grateful , you &apos;re not fearful , and if you &apos;re not fearful , you &apos;re not violent .
ka : as you say , it &apos;s not a memorial .
this is the boat we were on , by the way .
how long have we been divergent from each other ?
how are jobana , sintia and bertha really all that different from the mark zuckerbergs of the world ?
we want male leaders to become role models and change agents within their own institutions .
after all , they &apos;re just one tiny bit of earth &apos;s biodiversity .
when you come to tedx , you always think about technology , the world changing , becoming more innovative .
and i am not saying that understanding cooperation is going to cause us to be better people — and sometimes people cooperate to do bad things — but i will remind you that a few hundred years ago , people saw their loved ones die from diseases they thought were caused by sin or foreigners or evil spirits .
you can change the fabric of an entire country .
would you welcome the chance to come back to america ?
and so we see that violence is , in a way , behaving like a contagious disease .
secondly , the new machine age is exponential .
we hired this programmer , he came in , he drank our cokes and played foosball for three years and he had one idea .
and secondly , i &apos;m a recovering narcissist .
and over and over again , as i interviewed them and spent my days with them , i did hear stories of life change and amazing little details of change .
are you happy with the general direction of the country ?
mt : he weighs 300 pounds .
but if we can find ways to give more choices to both , that will give us a set of rules for changing rules that get us out of traps .
transplantation : you could take an organ out of one person , you could put it in another person , and it would work .
and we walked three valleys beyond , and the third valley , there was something quite mysterious and ominous , a discomfort i felt . and then i knew that had to be &#91; the &#93; setting of my book .
i &apos;m pleased to announce that , along with colleagues at stanford and caltech and ucsf , we &apos;re currently starting an initiative to explore biological dark matter for the existence of new forms of life .
i started turning it over in my head , and i realized , &quot; &quot; wait a minute — my head actually fits inside this thing . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) yeah , i cut a hole out , i put some acetate in there and i made myself a space helmet . ( laughter )
i want to know if there &apos;s a chemistry of morality . i want to know
( laughter ) maybe it &apos;s spiders .
and we have a small team who is working on this .
the real bacteria and viruses are so small we can &apos;t see them without a microscope , and you guys might know bacteria and viruses because they both make us sick .
and now let &apos;s reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best .
we have hear , this week , about the horrible sufferings , for example , that so many women of the world are enduring day-to-day .
angeline came to apply for the school , and she did not meet any criteria that we had .
that &apos;s called the circular flow of the economy .
but i know why you asked .
within it , there was 80 knots of wind , which was far too much wind for the boat and i to cope with .
now the science behind this is so potent that it became required by the american board of surgery in order for a young surgeon to become board certified .
there is another kind of graffiti that i find far more interesting , which i call editorial graffiti .
it was true just recently of ebola .
there &apos;s the audience in rhetorical arguments .
i don &apos;t think we need to worry about that .
you choose not to tell anyone for fear of losing your job or being seen as weak .
i come from an indigenous tribe in the mountains of balochistan called brahui .
and so when i met with three children from the schools , who had traveled all day to come to bogota , one of the three children brought her mother .
( laughter ) approximately 5,000 miles from delhi is the little town of gateshead .
over five hundred volunteers around the globe helped us get 90 families hundreds of photographs back , fully restored and retouched .
ca : now , this slide that we &apos;re showing here shows the dates in which different technology companies , internet companies , are alleged to have joined the program , and where data collection began from them .
they flunk out of caltech .
i &apos;m going to illustrate what i think we &apos;ve found about climate from those corals in the southern ocean .
he is 16 years old , loves hunting and fishing and being outside and doing anything with his hands , and so for him , studio h means that he can stay interested in his education through that hands-on engagement .
it could stop people on the street and arrest them in its own prisons .
our successes and our failures influence what we do with all of those , and to me , design and engineering , craftsmanship and skilled labor , are all the things that work on this to have our outcome , which is our human quality of life .
now , when we are anxious over choices , sometimes we easily give our power of choice away .
in the case of mr. snowden , he had the option of the nsa inspector general , the navy inspector general , the pacific command inspector general , the department of defense inspector general , and the intelligence community inspector general , any of whom would have both kept his concerns in classified channels and been happy to address them .
every time you listen to a recording today , every time you take out your ipod and whatever , every time you listen to it , it &apos;s the same thing — it &apos;s frozen .
there is no way we can talk about the building of stability if we don &apos;t start investing in women and girls .
in order to have that machine running , you need lots and lots of people .
that would be fantastic . so those are my three wishes .
now the way taskrabbit works is , people outsource the tasks that they want doing , name the price they &apos;re willing to pay , and then vetted rabbits bid to run the errand .
and indeed , recently he stated and committed that bali will be plastic bag free by 2018 .
raise your hand .
i am just one of a new generation that is growing up .
a very extreme culture .
if you take this thing , you know very well it weighs very little .
the production version , it uses ip version 6 .
so there is the pattern that every one of them had , but they all were a little different too .
ethiopia &apos;s agricultural market is 30 percent higher than south africa &apos;s grain production , and , in fact , ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in africa .
i was greedy .
and my motto is that there &apos;s a special place in hell for women who don &apos;t help each other .
nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures .
today , we &apos;re building a custom-made hidden camera , like the one that mary was wearing in her dress to film the intimidation meeting of the ruling political party .
( laughter ) and , you know , we were still in the game , but we were frightened that somebody at caltech would tell linus that he was wrong .
i don &apos;t smoke cigarillos anymore .
the other guy had to say , i &apos;m going to build 50 new schools .
most are neoclassical , heavy and opaque , made of stone or concrete .
every year a million and a half people die of a completely preventable disease . that &apos;s malaria . 6,000 people a day .
it &apos;s a company that thrives on idealism .
when he met me and realized that it was possible for him to study in a quantitative way how his design choices impacted the ecology and biology of this building , he got really excited , because it added a new dimension to what he did .
but it has to be done together .
and we cogitated about this for about four years .
so i didn &apos;t come to papercutting in a straight line .
but this is only in base 10 .
so , this is the website of the national cancer institute .
it &apos;s not good stuff , and it &apos;s from inefficient combustion , not from combustion itself .
look , at home i have two tvs . why ?
you put them in a portfolio and you try to smooth out the returns .
they needn &apos;t necessarily , but they can .
as far as we know , evidence to discover the most fundamental truths of all the sciences is here just for the taking , on our planet .
so i &apos;m not suggesting that anyone in this audience should run out and adopt the traditions of the torajans .
there were a bunch of these types of invariants .
it takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the west .
and specifically , there were a lot more women and minorities than i expected , and that you wouldn &apos;t usually see at a traditional engineering workshop .
gandhi , too , was a real flawed human being .
one , it doesn &apos;t operate at high pressure .
you could spend 400 years doing just that .
but if you ask the right kind of question , or you work it in the right kind of way , interesting things can emerge .
and she was scared . she was scared of drunks hanging around .
they &apos;re afraid of failing , but what sets them apart from the rest of us is that they &apos;re even more afraid of failing to try .
i feel kind of bad about that .
don &apos;t patent it . &quot; &quot; so we didn &apos;t , but it shows you how people , again , at times , don &apos;t really look at what &apos;s happening .
so that &apos;s what you want , is all your friends are identified , and you should just carry these relationships around .
soon after i started working , writing software in a company , a manager who worked at the company came down to where i was , and he whispered to me , &quot; can he tell if i &apos;m lying ? &quot;
but the important thing to know about rkcp is that it doesn &apos;t know the meaning of the words it &apos;s using .
and more than that , it &apos;s engendering new kinds of change .
that image was the start of the x-ray technology .
it had nothing to do with hating my body , i just love it enough to let it go , i treat it like a house , and when your house is falling apart , you do not evacuate , you make it comfortable enough to house all your insides , you make it pretty enough to invite guests over , you make the floorboards strong enough to stand on .
and it &apos;s because i &apos;m giving you critical data about me .
you can put them anywhere in the world you want to .
i &apos;d like to buy some concentrated , compressed gas cylinders of a lethal gas because i have these ideas , see , about wanting to suspend people .
not that they were any good , but they were there .
there &apos;s a last group of people who believe that the indus people were the ancestors of people living in south india today .
this is literally the colored sequence of those tiles .
the story i wanted to do initially was just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year where these animals migrate down from the canadian arctic to the gulf of st. lawrence in canada to engage in courtship , mating and to have their pups .
thank you very much .
we have some of the partners lined up .
we ask the bamboo what it &apos;s good at , what it wants to become , and what it says is : respect it , design for its strengths , protect it from water , and to make the most of its curves .
now finally , we can measure earth &apos;s energy imbalance precisely by measuring the heat content in earth &apos;s heat reservoirs .
and on this farm there was the farmer , his wife , and there was the four-year-old daughter .
now today , i told you about very strange and weird protocells — some that contain clay , some that have primordial ooze in them , some that have basically oil instead of water inside of them .
and so what we needed to do was increase the wing area so that we just had more grip , develop higher forces .
russia . chad wanted to fight against homophobia in russia .
can you hear that ?
it can do this in 14 milliseconds . it &apos;s unbelievable .
and they certainly didn &apos;t intend to describe the mechanics of supernova explosions , which eventually told us where the building blocks of life were synthesized in the universe .
i think it will be more if we keep burning fossil fuels , perhaps even five meters , which is 18 feet , this century or shortly thereafter .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a behavior called path integration .
my family moved ; we &apos;re nomads .
that &apos;s the best part .

and zuckerberg said , &quot; &quot; a squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in africa . &quot; &quot; and i want to talk about what a web based on that idea of relevance might look like .
the perpetrators saw them too .
i think he should be in the trunk , because he made my family possible .
that &apos;s 8 a.m. shadows .
it &apos;s as hard for us to let go of spacetime and objects as it is for the jewel beetle to let go of its bottle .
if that picture &apos;s true , then we have to discover those higgs particles at the lhc .
so i can pile things up , i can flip through it , i can , you know — okay , let &apos;s move this photo to the back , let &apos;s delete this guy here , and i think it &apos;s just a much more rich kind of way of interacting with your information .

unfortunately , many people still think that whale conservationists like myself do what we do only because these creatures are charismatic and beautiful .
and this one &apos;s particularly interesting , because , of all the glaciers in north america , it receives the highest volume of human traffic in a year .
it plummets . something is going on here .
and the reason why is that we live on a planet that is rapidly urbanizing .
they are a network of small computing machines , working in networks .
the skin &apos;s a whole another thing , probably the hardest part .
a : how does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are ?
this is my quest : to give computers visual intelligence and to create a better future for leo and for the world .
so it was not a lot of time . and that sense of possibility — what could this thing be ?
it actually uses its tail too , just like we saw in the lab .
he had a stroke , he had brain surgery , radiation , chemotherapy .
and my mother , brave lady , was partly to blame , taking me to the new york natural history museum , buying me books on snakes , and then starting this infamous career of mine , which has culminated in of course , arriving in india 60 years ago , brought by my mother , doris norden , and my stepfather , rama chattopadhyaya .
i &apos;ve been sending out valentines on a fairly large scale since 2005 .
this is a spectacular picture of our home planet .
when it has a scarce resource that it wants to turn into a desirable outcome , it thinks in terms of efficiency .
and yes , technology disruption is not only a big deal in software and electronics .
where do you think the action is going to be ?
so , we developed a lesson delivery model for instruction that focused on small group instruction , making it possible for all the students to get their individual needs met in the classroom .
and before long , they think , &quot; &quot; well jeez , this is kind of historic .
i then discovered why i take so much inspiration from iranian women .
or they burn the plastics to get to the metals in burn houses like you see here .
that &apos;s pretty high for most occupations .
the second mistake that i made was worse .
we &apos;re all here , and all of those who watch it are going to be traumatized by this event , but all of you here who are victims are going to learn some hard truths .
economic games . so what we do is we go into two areas .
but anything above here , if it &apos;s murky , i can already feel it right now .
and then just trying to figure out how to make that using stuff .
reporters call this &quot; &quot; making shit up . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) and they recommend against crossing that line .

after he was shot , raisuddin &apos;s life grew no easier .
in this way , frank grieves .
i mean , these sort of top-down , mono-functional , capital-intensive solutions are really not going to cut it .
tm : thank you very much .
this was a perfect example .
well it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head , until actually i realized it was happening because of four key drivers .
my editor at geographic wanted me to find america &apos;s blue zone .
so from here , it &apos;s pretty clear to me , we would prefer to have cleaner , cheaper , domestic , ours — and we have that , we have that — which is natural gas .
just imagine wembley stadium with 100,000 chimpanzees .
but long term , long term , if you think that the russians were antagonized by the us and europe expanding nato right up to their borders when we said they weren &apos;t going to , and the eu encroaching them , just wait until the chinese put hundreds of billions of dollars in every country around russia they thought they had influence in .
it &apos;s an eternal quest .
instead of talking about little green men , he talked about how the psyche of the europeans had been traumatized by the war , and now they &apos;re projecting flying saucers into the sky .

or you could ask it if people are going to like your next song , or your next flavor of ice cream .
eventually , i expect that the streets will probably extend through a redevelopment of the mall .
if refugees were simply allowed to travel directly and seek asylum in europe , we would avoid that , and there &apos;s a way of doing that through something called a humanitarian visa , that allows people to collect a visa at an embassy or a consulate in a neighboring country and then simply pay their own way through a ferry or a flight to europe .
and he said , on the spot , &quot; &quot; absolutely , yes . &quot; &quot; well , the only way to experience zero-g on earth is actually with parabolic flight , weightless flight .
this is clearly not a good arrangement .
and i can keep standing here for the 12 minutes and 53 seconds that i have left and make fun of all sorts of ways we manage money , and at the end you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; &quot; how can we help people ? &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what i really want to focus on today .
and you see agenda — this is marketing , this is politics — trying to convince you to have one model versus another , trying to convince you to ignore a model and trust your feelings , marginalizing people with models you don &apos;t like .
and they said to the architects , &quot; &quot; look , our corridors are an absolute nightmare .
indian institutes and educational system , with a few exceptions , are incapable of producing students in the quantity and quality needed to keep this innovation engine going , so companies are finding innovative ways to overcome this , but in the end it does not absolve the government of the responsibility for creating this educational structure .
he didn &apos;t recognize that at the time , and he contracted leukemia .
well , you could fit it into a range of different interpretative frameworks .
and i came out of medical school with the impression that if i memorized everything and knew everything , or as much as possible , as close to everything as possible , that it would immunize me against making mistakes .
well , this is what happens when you pair people up at random .
where do you come from ?
and in fact , there &apos;s this other group of people who are not as divided as people might think , and that group is economists .
there &apos;s a mannequin hidden behind a wall , and we &apos;re going to bounce light off the door .
they had to look at computer projections for the housing market .
it could have looked like shop windows on fifth avenue at christmas , but because of the way that andrew connected with the mcqueen team , he was channeling the rawness and the brilliance of mcqueen , and the show was quite transcendant , and it became a phenomenon in its own right .
now with the allocation and the understanding of the lack of understanding , we enter into a new era of science in which we feel nothing more than so much so as to say that those within themselves , comporary or non-comporary , will figuratively figure into the folding of our non-understanding and our partial understanding to the networks of which we all draw our source and conclusions from .

and i think the same thing will happen here .
the mass of this comes out of the air .
right now , you have a few enthusiasts talking about it , some in a positive side , some in a negative side — but that &apos;s a dangerous state to be in because there &apos;s very little depth of knowledge on this topic .
and eventually , over time , i didn &apos;t have to play the stage fright song at all .
this is cs 101 .
and that the incredible amount of effort to deliver those sketches for years and years and years is not only something to be derided , but we would merely write it off as merely execution .
because our business has refused to use science .
now here &apos;s the kicker .
ffl : and it hasn &apos;t learned to appreciate the stunning beauty of nature like you and i do .
that &apos;s a bipedal octopus that &apos;s disguised as a rolling coconut .
i &apos;d like to call it the lost art of productively losing control .
and these would be real homework assignments for a real grade , with a real deadline .
but nobody did .
now , throughout history , men practically had a license to cheat with little consequence , and supported by a host of biological and evolutionary theories that justified their need to roam , so the double standard is as old as adultery itself .
right , which , i admit , i do . right ? i &apos;ve talked about it before .
( laughter ) every time i look at this piece , i always wonder if my mom &apos;s whispering to my dad , &quot; he finally folded his laundry . &quot; ( laughter )

supermarkets are an easy place to start .
here , but — ( applause ) — anyway . ( applause )
they spent the 1990s working the messy scene between globalized parts of the world what i call the core and the gap .
what is fuzzy rope , you ask ?
in this clip you can see two other important elements .
( laughter ) there are a lot of ideas to die for .
well , you see the nice story of getting richer and getting healthier — everyone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide .
so we have to think as if we are actually on mars with the rover .
they &apos;re just living life , and they end up just acting like that .
this is really pretty weird . &quot; &quot; and you &apos;ll see soon that my graduate student ...
and we &apos;ve asked : what is the scientific unifying idea here ?
this is what you see at this overall level .
i noticed it &apos;s very multicultural .
within five weeks , you start to see the early atrium and the early ventricles .
there are 1.4 million pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries living with hiv and of these , 90 percent are in sub-saharan africa .
( laughter ) and then finally , in thailand we &apos;re buddhist , we don &apos;t have a god , so instead , we say , &quot; &quot; in rubber we trust . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) so you can see that we added everything to our endeavor to make life better for the people .
that condition &apos;s going to be there for the next 10 to 15 years if they realize what they want , which is , you know , 400 to 500 million more people coming into the cities .
european governments , for the most part , haven &apos;t acknowledged responsibility , and there &apos;s nothing to kind of to push back and up against .
this is one of the most desired things by poor people all over the world , in the cities and in the countryside .
witness : we walked and walked for two days .
and then luckily , you know , i had the fortune of going to something called a library , and in the library i came upon this very book .
no one has made a complete crossing of the arctic ocean on their own .
and when the president stood up to speak , i found myself on my feet shouting at the president , telling him to remember the post-election violence victims , to stop the corruption .
and he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself .
anyway , i &apos;m out of time .
if we look under the hood , this is what we find : basically the same thing .
and they actually do .
so the truckers are just going about their business , and they &apos;re buying fuel .
it was like , you know , she was there in the class , you know , she was kind of typically french .
you see the local laborers . you see the english engineer giving directions in the background . and more importantly , the places are the same . these cables still connect these classic port cities , places like lisbon , mombasa , mumbai , singapore , new york .
on this side , you &apos;ve got a number — the average number of tosses until head-tail-head .
pearls , / harmonicas , jujubes , aspirins ! all / the stuff they &apos;ve always talked about ( ... ) alright , time &apos;s up .
for jasmine , a fallout shelter is an app in the android store .
and one of them is that despite all our accomplishments , a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day .
i remember just being so frightened and terrified .
so bill cosby , whose bail was set at a million dollars , immediately writes the check , and doesn &apos;t spend a second in a jail cell .
here , what you see is a picture that shows insufficient democracy .
where you are sitting now would be under water .
and it &apos;s important to recognize that this is true by virtue of speed alone .
i met with people that are supposed to be my enemies for the first time . and we just shake hands , and have a coffee and a nice discussion , and we talk about food and basketball .
and flowers are a real bugger .
you just ate .
if you lop this off and attach it to the tail of a different bacterium , which creates a vigorous immune response , they &apos;ve created a very powerful flu fighter .
misha glenny : anonymous , ladies and gentlemen — a sophisticated group of politically motivated hackers who have emerged in 2011 .
so we &apos;re able to bring the camera right up to the elephant , put food into the elephant &apos;s mouth , show people what &apos;s going on inside their mouths , and show everyone around the world how incredible these animals really are .
i think that nature is anywhere where life thrives , anywhere where there are multiple species together , anywhere that &apos;s green and blue and thriving and filled with life and growing .
it makes a huge difference .
the death penalty was a sanction for a long list of non-violent crimes : criticizing the king , stealing a loaf of bread . slavery , of course , was the preferred labor-saving device , and cruelty was a popular form of entertainment . perhaps the most vivid example was the practice of cat burning , in which a cat was hoisted on a stage and lowered in a sling into a fire , and the spectators shrieked in laughter as the cat , howling in pain , was burned to death .
i was blown away when i saw it . i was like , wait , this is the gay agenda ?
it &apos;s this idea of destiny or the one true calling , the idea that we each have one great thing we are meant to do during our time on this earth , and you need to figure out what that thing is and devote your life to it .
i came to believe that a leader isn &apos;t good because they &apos;re right ; they &apos;re good because they &apos;re willing to learn and to trust .
dg : this is one of them , another one of our favorites , because it &apos;s a little octopod .
so now , different persons , older , tap .
uganda has 961 sub-counties , each of them with a dispensary , none of which has an ambulance .
remember , just a few years earlier , news was consumed from just three places : reading a newspaper or magazine , listening to the radio , or watching television .
this depressed me , because one of the things that i did not want to discover with this index is that it &apos;s purely the province of rich countries to help poor countries .
but what she does remember is throwing up in the hall outside mike &apos;s room and staring at the wall silently while he was inside her , wanting it to stop , then shakily stumbling home .
now what that tells us is that wall tissues are doing so much more than just covering the vascular tissues .
be aware that you &apos;re not going to experience the same thing as the performer is .
it &apos;s up there .
&quot; i want to give you a hug . &quot;
that has got to be stopped .
now , whatever you think about the morality of these sites — and i submit that it &apos;s not actually an easy question — the creation of functioning , competitive , anonymous markets , where nobody knows who anybody else is , constantly at risk of being shut down by the authorities , is a staggering achievement , a phenomenal achievement .
you can ignore most of that axis , because if you &apos;re driving around town , and the car starts stopping randomly , you &apos;re never going to buy that car .
the trees can put their roots into it .
three hundred and forty-four frames , four and a half years and commissions later , what started as a one person show became a collaborative work of nineteen most talented artists .
the technology there was much more difficult than what i &apos;m dealing with here .
that &apos;s the hard stuff that trees are made of .
there is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus where teeth and eyes are represented , and that part of the gyrus is activated when people get the deformed hallucinations .
so we started doing this . and you can see here on the horizontal axis you &apos;ve got the number of people killed in an attack or the size of the attack .
okay , are you registered to vote ?
if we work with those , if we change those companies and the way they do business , then the rest will happen automatically .
thank you .
and what we did on this is we analyzed the top 25 percent of these , and we started to see where the connections occurred , where they connected with each other .
( laughter ) i &apos;m a surgeon so that &apos;s not that funny . ( laughter )
in fact , she &apos;s the one who taught me as a young girl how to read .
we need to start to think differently and radically .
it &apos;s all the unanswered questions which make mathematics a living subject .
so each person is looking at the looking of everyone else before them .
the crazy thing about this dance is that the cakewalk was performed for the masters , who never suspected they were being made fun of .
it would take me weeks just to figure out what i was looking at from raw ones and zeros , but because our brains can instantly pick up and recognize these subtle patterns inside of these visual abstractions , we can unconsciously apply those in new situations .
and these tin particles were deposited on the tape heads and were crashing the tape heads .
on average , the e.u. has grown by one country per year since the end of the cold war .
( laughter ) dh : wow , you &apos;ve been working out .
we found kiko , who is partially deaf .
and this is a moment from &quot; &quot; the graduate . &quot; &quot; do you remember this moment ?
eight million people are missing , which is more than 20 percent of our current workforce , so big numbers , really big numbers .
because he said it to me .
you can see the commands .
sp : we like to give these insurgents a fair chance .
we don &apos;t know for sure if they really understand the function of the whistles .
that january , taft was the guest of honor at a banquet in atlanta , and for days in advance , the big news was the menu .
and what we want with these pictures is to create a discussion about what we have that is pristine on the planet and what we must hold on this planet if we want to live , to have some equilibrium in our life .
the point is that together , this diversity of different approaches can cope with more or less anything that evolution has been able to throw up .
all i am is a witness .
our bodies are home to trillions of microbes , and these creatures define who we are .
you know , you &apos;re not supposed to take long , warm showers .
it was not abused once .
( laughter ) for example , during a debate .
she wanted to dance .
and right on ... pie man ... potentially ... my stories uh : and you can see that these words start to induce alignment in early language areas , but not more than that .
it &apos;s not the actual literal sunrise that &apos;s coming .
in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you , this finger right here , my index finger is just going to shift from where it is , to a position pointing out like this .
so my co-author , roo rogers , and i have actually gathered thousands of examples from all around the world of collaborative consumption .
and first of all , you know , despite what the french intellectuals say , it seems that no one wakes up in the morning thinking , &quot; may i suffer the whole day ? &quot;
and i never thought about noes anymore , or not seeing , or any of that kind of nothing .
most northern cities today are 100 times safer than they were just 100 years ago .
so that &apos;s why it looks maybe a little bit weird , especially to the people who deal with structures in general .
and especially with sugar , our bodies send a signal to our brain that says , &quot; remember what you &apos;re eating and where you found it . &quot;
and it &apos;s not just atrazine they &apos;re exposed to .
jake : hey guys .
now , fashion designers have the broadest palette imaginable in this creative industry .
but it &apos;s everybody &apos;s job who can change attitude and behavior .
can we use them ?
but it &apos;s true that neuroscience shows that there is no centre in the brain where things do all come together . &quot; &quot; so when you look at the brain , and you look at how the brain makes possible a sense of self , you find that there isn &apos;t a central control spot in the brain .
but anyway , loaning out-of-print works from the boston public library , the woods hole oceanographic institute and a few other libraries that are starting to participate in this program , to try out this model of where does a library stop and where does the bookstore take over .
and this is very normal now , of modern day conflict , because they &apos;re easy to bring into wars .
so we started talking about climate change .
so we got brand new ones , shiny ones , medium ones , and very old , dark ones .
so i can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes , or in the complicated cases , in a few hours .
it physically carves out conversation space for one .
but also , chinese social media is really changing chinese mindsets and chinese life .
jk : so now we had painted a whole street .
after 40 years , the global organic movement has achieved 0.7 of one percent of global food .
the sun is eight minutes ago . that &apos;s not such a big deal , right , unless there &apos;s solar flares coming then you want to get out the way .
and in the bmj , in the first edition of january , 2012 , you can see a study which looks to see if people kept to that ruling , and it turns out that only one in five have done so .
so here &apos;s the other issue that i just think we &apos;ve got to be concerned about .
and you know , it &apos;s getting worse , because we won &apos;t be able to find the physical evidence of where we are coming from on this planet , and the reason being is that anything that is older than four billion years is gone .
now , when we went to film studios and games developers and showed them that technology , we got a very good response .
five is yellow .
that &apos;s routinely translated as , &quot; &quot; i think , therefore i am . &quot; &quot; but there is a better translation .
or , i want to look at anxiety , because people are praying for anxiety .
this is where you &apos;ll find the fastest growing young populations of the world .
we are left with this missing space of increased deaths the further north you go .
let &apos;s play a little .
so here i get this call from this random guy that &apos;s having an experience that &apos;s being influenced by people at some social distance .
to have a conversation with it . to speak . to listen .
read in the right way , our fears are an amazing gift of the imagination , a kind of everyday clairvoyance , a way of glimpsing what might be the future when there &apos;s still time to influence how that future will play out .
it &apos;s an index of large companies from developed markets across the world .
let &apos;s help them be proud of who they are , because our education system welcomes their families , their cultures , their communities and the skill set they &apos;ve learned to survive .
it conveys authorship .
i started to get the head ok , but the tail i couldn &apos;t do .
and yet , after all the attention they have garnered , and all the knowledge they have generated , as well as the lion &apos;s share of the funding , here we are standing &#91; before &#93; the same litany of intractable problems and many new challenges .
so co2 , methane , and ice sheets were feedbacks that amplified global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge , even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing .
he had the expectations of his senatorial father and washington , d.c.
and what was interesting about it is the obvious choice for me to talk about was graphics and audio .
( laughter ) there were cardboard cut-out snowflakes covering the floor , glitter on every flat surface , and icicles all over the walls .
and in our offices , we spend a lot of time at work .
also , people were taking photographs of this , so it was being texted around the world extremely quickly , all this imagery .
and if i was going to survive , that &apos;s what i wanted to do .
so we came up with a different protocell model , and this is actually simpler than the previous one .
&quot; hey , look , the pirate party has its website up now after new year &apos;s . &quot;
but isolation isn &apos;t good .
bf : seven-club juggling .
i shot the film in recife , in the place where he is from .
but when i am working in my house and writing , after a day &apos;s writing , i rush downstairs and i &apos;m very excited to talk about marcus garvey or bob marley and words are tripping out of my mouth like butterflies and i &apos;m so excited that my children stop me , and they say , &quot; &quot; dad , nobody cares . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) but they do care , actually .
because , if the board of directors convince everybody that the success of any organization is almost entirely dependent on the decisions made by the board of directors , it makes the disparity in salaries slightly more justifiable than if you actually acknowledge that quite a lot of the credit for a company &apos;s success might actually lie somewhere else , in small pieces of tactical activity .
but i don &apos;t think any of those businesses would say they &apos;re perfect . we certainly wouldn &apos;t .
and so amira can &apos;t go back there .
we can grade models , whether it &apos;s financial models in a business class or physical models in a science or engineering class and we can grade some pretty sophisticated programming assignments .
just think of the benefits when it comes to jobs , productivity , employment , child nutrition , maternal mortality , literacy and much , much more .
they too have natural resources that can help win the world &apos;s fight for sustainability , only they may not have the ability to invest in them now .
but like a lot of modern men , he hugs , he bakes , he leaves work early to coach little league .
you may have seen this anecdote that was printed in forbes magazine where target sent a flyer to this 15-year-old girl with advertisements and coupons for baby bottles and diapers and cribs two weeks before she told her parents that she was pregnant .
it just doesn &apos;t drive behavior .
some people believe that this would spread uncontrollably , and that the bacteria would kill everything in its way .
what &apos;s it there for ?
now , to understand laughter , you have to look at a part of the body that psychologists and neuroscientists don &apos;t normally spend much time looking at , which is the ribcage , and it doesn &apos;t seem terribly exciting , but actually you &apos;re all using your ribcage all the time .
this message is given as a public service .
this isn &apos;t really a voting one , so on three everyone shout out what you see .
( laughter ) thank you very much .
after you take out that 99.999 percent , that tiny percentage of tweets remaining works out to roughly 150,000 per month .
we &apos;re developing these tools , but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world , so people can study and try to treat different disorders .
alright . well if larger markets increase the incentive to produce new ideas , how do we maximize that incentive ?
ps : a very dramatic transformation has come about .
( laughter ) not a very useful skill , especially when the money runs out .
but yet , it was human .
this is the kangerlussuaq river in southwest greenland .
juxtapose that to the earlier chart of corporate profit margins , and i ask you , does that feel right ?
and maybe person number three , in turn , points at person number one as the primary source .
it actually got so bad that somebody put our country up for sale on ebay .
so we &apos;ve got a joke in ushahidi where we say , &quot; &quot; if it works in africa , it &apos;ll work anywhere . &quot; &quot; &#91; most use technology to define the function . we use function to drive the technology . &#93; what if we could overcome the problem of unreliable internet and electricity and reduce the cost of connection ?
i &apos;m the one who doesn &apos;t want to be interrupted .
is there any room for that experience in atheism 2.0 ?
so let me show you some things .
one chimp is called a matcher .
this is a story about the fact that people want their resources managed properly for their good , and not taken out to places where they &apos;ll benefit just a few of the elite .
and honestly i don &apos;t know what that &apos;s called .
they are very different from us in body form .
but i ask why ?
common sense , a rare idea in the law , but here it was . common sense — ( laughter ) — revolts at the idea . common sense .
the press calls my particular volantor a &quot; &quot; skycar . &quot; &quot; this is a little bit earlier version of it , that &apos;s why it &apos;s given the x designation , but it &apos;s a four-passenger aircraft that could take off vertically , like a helicopter — therefore it doesn &apos;t need an airfield .
gladly , they do re-establish communication with the character , astronaut watney , at some point so that he &apos;s not as alone on mars until he can be rescued .
now lets tempt four-year-olds , giving them a treat .
about 12 years ago , there was a story published , a horrible story , that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles , mumps and rubella vaccine shot .
then it just took another three months for &#91; the &#93; u.n. to get it into their server , and on friday we got the new trend line — it was down here .
interesting where it came from .
boltzmann gave us a formula — engraved on his tombstone now — that really quantifies what entropy is .
they raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands .
this is a deal i had with natasha , which is that when we got to atlanta she could take — she could cut off my beard .
and i want to talk through some examples today of things that people have done that i think are really fascinating using flexible identity and anonymity on the web and blurring the lines between fact and fiction .
consider the financial price time series , a given stock , your perfect stock , or a global index .

we have a network for grateful living , and it has mushroomed .
our good friend chris has about a six percent — but with a bullet , i might add .

wikipedia , on the other hand , begins with a very radical idea , and that &apos;s for all of us to imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge .
data , data , data .
this is a tracking experiment , and any of you scuba divers , if you want to get involved in one of the coolest projects ever , this is off the great barrier reef .
for the longest time people have regarded science and humanities as being distinct .
right , i &apos;m an oncologist and i have to say most of what we give is actually poison .
so they &apos;re really small , generally , they &apos;re square and flat and hard , and frankly , most of them just aren &apos;t very attractive , and so my team and i have been thinking of ways to really change and mix up the process and the outcome of designing electronics .
so sight is one third of your brain by volume and can claim about two thirds of your brain &apos;s processing resources .
it &apos;s a highly focused product aimed at strictly the education market , not only in the developing countries , but actually in the developed regions as well , because there are parts of the united states where this can have also a huge impact on the ability to make education more fun and more efficient .
not only do they live infinite lives , but the same life is lived infinite times till you get to the point of it all .
i am not a farmer .
you stood up because the book actually puts the spotlight on shamers .
( laughter ) any lady , any lady ? thank you very much .
and when you &apos;re laughing , you enter into a state of openness .
here is an innovation , a design innovation .
so you can imagine that the water had tens or even hundreds of millions of years to sculpt the strangest forms on the tepuis &apos; surfaces , but also to open the fractures and form stone cities , rock cities , fields of towers which are characterized in the famous landscape of the tepuis .
okay , so the bad news first : for every major stressful life experience , like financial difficulties or family crisis , that increased the risk of dying by 30 percent .
now the same view in 2010 .

and the third , democratic choice in muslim-majority societies has been relegated to a political choice , meaning political parties in many of these societies ask people to vote for them as the democratic party , but then the other parties ask them to vote for them as the military party — wanting to rule by military dictatorship .
actually , we &apos;ve got ourselves locked into this industrial era mindset which says that the only people who can make cities are large organizations or corporations who build on our behalf , procuring whole neighborhoods in single , monolithic projects , and of course , form follows finance .
from the moment that our ancestors , perhaps two and a half million years ago or so , began imitating , there was a new copying process .
child : oh , that is so cool .
he comes straight into the channel .
now , these are big claims .
( applause ) now , i don &apos;t tell you this to impress you .
so i want to extrapolate on this idea a bit with something that &apos;s a little bit crazy .
they make chemical words , they recognize those words , and they turn on group behaviors that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison .
you see , it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song , you needed a studio and a producer .
so it &apos;s not just the end user that you &apos;re thinking about , but everyone who interacts with the product , so , for example , the prosthetist who fits the knee , but also the context in which the knee is being fit .
discrete moments from our lives are its chapters .
i &apos;ll be focusing on the air here . this is a solar-powered airplane — 165 miles carrying a person from france to england as a symbol that solar power is going to be an important part of our future . then we did the solar car for general motors — the sunracer — that won the race in australia .
( movie montage of &quot; &quot; it &apos;s 4 a.m. &quot; &quot; ) ( laughter ) rives : so somewhere along the line , i realized i have a hobby i didn &apos;t know i wanted , and it is crowdsourced .
and a lot of talks here have espoused the benefits of having lots of people look at problems , share the information and work on those things together .
adrenaline , kill . it &apos;ll give you the will .
on the list it would be stuff like , seeing the daffodils bloom in the spring , the smell of new-mown hay , catching a wave and bodysurfing , the touch of a baby &apos;s hand , the sound of doc watson playing the guitar , listening to old records of muddy waters and uncle dave macon .
we knew that 210 million women were saying they wanted access to contraceptives , even the contraceptives we have here in the united states , and we weren &apos;t providing them because of the political controversy in our country , and to me that was just a crime , and i kept looking around trying to find the person that would get this back on the global stage , and i finally realized i just had to do it .
he put his hand on the throttle .
one part of medicine , though , has faced the problem of behavior change pretty well , and that &apos;s dentistry .
these cars will work in certain places and not in others .
things that would take us weeks , months to find in ones and zeroes , are immediately apparent in some sort of visual abstraction , and as we continue to go through this and throw more and more information at it , what we find is that we &apos;re capable of processing billions of ones and zeros in a matter of seconds just by using our brain &apos;s built-in ability to analyze patterns .
they were really looking for us , the designers , to create the skins , to put some pretty stuff outside of the box .
for the reason that you need to attract volunteers .
the televised death and march had a huge impact on public opinion .
i think one of the reasons i care so much about robots that use their body to communicate and use their body to move is — i &apos;m going to let you in on a little secret we roboticists are hiding — is that every one of you is going to be living with a robot at some point in your life .
i think it &apos;s really important to understand that something like this is totally open . it &apos;s right there for you to find .
a sound came out of my mouth that i &apos;d never heard before : half groan , half scream , barely human and pure terror .
dan o &apos;brien jumped 5 &apos; 11 &quot; &quot; in &apos; 96 in atlanta , i mean , if it just gives you a comparison of — these are truly accomplished athletes , without qualifying that word &quot; &quot; athlete . &quot; &quot; and so i decided to give this a shot : heart pounding , i ran my first race and i beat the national record-holder by three hundredths of a second , and became the new national record-holder on my first try out .
we visit kibbutzim that were established by holocaust survivors .
it did not .
i mean , it &apos;s amazing to think that , in every single minute of this speech , 25 hours of youtube video will be loaded .
they exclude billions of people from the global economy , for example , people who don &apos;t have enough money to have a bank account .
( laughter ) this is a high-speed centrifuge .
we put a telescope or a camera in that shadow , we look back at the sun , and most of the light &apos;s been removed and we can see that dim , fine structure in the corona .
that &apos;s just to show the scale and the actual size of the sculpture .
what is even more tragic is that we know about a bunch of other species of animals out there , but their biology remains sorely under-studied .
because if you could find those , those would be some of the signals that could drive learning .
we don &apos;t talk about it . it &apos;s not even a consideration .
the men in my life taught me some important things , as well .

they didn &apos;t foment the businesses . they didn &apos;t do the ipos .

they were the normal high school curriculum for japanese students — the other 4,999 students in the school , who were japanese , besides the american .
well , one last story , very quickly .
well how else can we create new ideas ?
that &apos;s the difference , that &apos;s the difference between us and the dinosaurs .
and the result of our meeting was a robotic rocket-powered airplane we call ares .
but what about countries where democracy doesn &apos;t exist , countries where there are no words to describe the concepts that underpin a democratic society ?

so something will resolve down to the information about a particular person , so every person will have a unique id .
i didn &apos;t want to go with this ruthless predator image .
i &apos;m a savant , or more precisely , a high-functioning autistic savant .

just to take biodiversity , at the current rate , by 2050 , 30 percent of all species on earth will have disappeared .
and of these 45 molecules , only 4629 actually smells of sandalwood .
it &apos;s open source , meaning we publish and share all of our design files and all of our code online , allowing anyone to modify or improve or change the design .
i &apos;ve designed too many faces in the past that were intended to mitigate technical problems .
it &apos;s how they store information .
so if i want to see the back side , i can flip and see from behind .
jja : ok , now . when we shot that scene , we were there doing it , the actor who had the gun , an english actor , eddie marsan — sweetheart , great guy — he kept taking the gun and putting it into tom &apos;s nose , and it was hurting tom &apos;s nose .

the bone is cracked .
when the family is in trouble , facing hardship , facing hard times , remittances increase , they act like an insurance .
junkies find veins in their toes when the ones in their arms and their legs collapse . developing tar sands and coal shale is the equivalent . here are just a few of the investments that i personally think make sense .
they had three full-time guards who were posted around this sanctuary whose job was in fact to guard against illegal logging , and one day , we went walking , again as tourists , out into the forest , and within five minutes &apos; walk , we stumbled upon somebody who was just sawing a tree down , five minutes &apos; walk , a few hundred meters from the ranger station .
it &apos;s good that compassion was extended beyond the family by this kind of evolutionary logic .
he was in a movie called &quot; &quot; torch song trilogy . &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; torch song trilogy &quot; &quot; was based on a play about this drag queen who essentially was looking for love .
they maintain the health of our ecosystems , and also they save us money .
we can start with something as simple as sharing our position data between cars , just sharing gps .
and you persuade people to go to these great feats of invention , but at a personal level , in a way i can &apos;t imagine doing your job .
so , she had to go to meeting after meeting , same arguments made over and over again .
i essentially drag sledges for a living , so it doesn &apos;t take an awful lot to flummox me intellectually , but i &apos;m going to read this question from an interview earlier this year : &quot; &quot; philosophically , does the constant supply of information steal our ability to imagine or replace our dreams of achieving ?
i think back to my father .
so the great thing about the mola is that when we put the tag on them — if you look up here — that &apos;s streaming off , that &apos;s right where we put the tag .
so if you think about it , these are really dramatically improving .
if they get surrounded , they notice that too , they might get a little flustered .
nobody believed us .
basically , a zero-sum game is the kind you &apos;re used to in sports , where there &apos;s a winner and a loser .
and then went on , my next summer , to work under dr. basu at the unt health center at fort worth , texas .
the second problem is that these robots have onboard sensors that end up being very expensive — a laser scanner , a camera and the processors .
we think the one that got the dinosaurs was about five miles wide .
do we care about their future ?
so that was the 20th century .
and they were able to do it . that was their design , using that same computer modeling system and only five or six really different kinds of parts , a couple of struts , like this , some exterior cladding material and a very simple framing system that was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck .
and not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint , sustainable from an economic standpoint as well .
so we &apos;ve got that incredible ramp-up .
you excavated from somewhere , came up from inside and deepened it .
and you can see here , he &apos;s starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe .
now we &apos;ve got f18s and f22s , and if somebody loses an arm , we give them a plastic stick with a hook on it . &quot; &quot; and they basically said , &quot; &quot; this is unacceptable , &quot; &quot; and then the punchline : &quot; &quot; so , dean , we &apos;re here because you make medical stuff .
in dharavi the slum performs not only a lot of services for itself , but it performs services for the city at large .
now , the reason i say that , because , afterwards , i was thinking — well , i went back into the school — i felt dirty ; i felt betrayed ; i felt ashamed , but mainly — mainly , i felt powerless .
one and the same event has a level of description where it &apos;s neurobiological , and another level of description where it &apos;s mental , and that &apos;s a single event , and that &apos;s how nature works . that &apos;s how it &apos;s possible for consciousness to function causally .

thank you .
based on my field research , i believe that international and congolese actors should pay more attention to the resolution of land conflict and the promotion of inter-community reconciliation .
so this is a blog devoted to unfortunate portraiture .
so , at best , the image is meant to float away into abstraction and multiple truths and fantasy .
but in the 1970s , some countries caught up .
it took several stages , in fact , starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
but here , on this image of the world , remember we &apos;ve stretched the map again .
can we achieve the global goals ?
and romo will actually stream video to this device .
we don &apos;t know what this thing is thinking .
and we walked into a house with a very special home video recording system .
and 3.7 million people have taken the questionnaire in america .
right ? whether it &apos;s the world trade organization or it &apos;s the imf , the world bank , the bretton woods accord on currency , these were american institutions , our values , our friends , our allies , our money , our standards .

and that is the key .
i had the privilege to speak twice to the president &apos;s climate task force .
and then if that person interrupts , then those two heads may turn .
so , as you can see , before , there is a leveling system built into this software so that as evan , or any user , becomes more familiar with the system , they can continue to add more and more detections , so that the system begins to differentiate between different distinct thoughts .
but what happens for your ligament when i need an intact ligament ?
so far , our atmosphere has done , and our magnetic field has done pretty well protecting us from this .
my last book was about the story behind the shi &apos;a-sunni split , and for that i &apos;d worked closely with the earliest islamic histories , so i knew the events to which the koran constantly refers , its frame of reference .
these are all traditional water structures , which we won &apos;t be able to explain in such a short time .
when i talked to the kind rep from ted , and i said , &quot; listen , you know , what should i talk about ? &quot;
and after this i wanted to build a computer out of people , called a human-powered computer .
and in many ways , it was the climax of the black civil rights movement in the united states .
i can take two of these and put them together like this and see what happens .
if we were any other kind of mammal , or any other kind of animal , we would say , &quot; that must be something to do with pheromones , &quot; and we &apos;d start looking properly .
but it hasn &apos;t really been shown , it &apos;s because you have a neural simulator , simulating your own body and subtracting off that sense .
( laughing ) so the tedtalk laid out in very simple terms , a charter city is a place where you start with uninhabited land , a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to opt in , to go live under those rules or not .
to make further progress we really need to look at the orbits of stars that are much further away .
what you &apos;re going to use is google cellular .
not a single example of reform has been produced yet .
copyediting at the new yorker is a mechanical process .
but it &apos;s really tiny .
but we &apos;re spending 36 percent .
( applause ) but this really requires going beyond what we do , or what we have done , if you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness .
and here comes the third reason : unesco stated that in 2025 , 100 million students will be deprived from higher education simply because there will not be enough seats to accommodate them , to meet the demand .
and when they do all of that for about five years , they get the coveted board certification .
just ask syrian dictator bashar al-assad , i assure you that his facebook page has not embraced the power of participation .
i said , &quot; &quot; it would have to show up free . &quot; &quot; and so it showed up , we used it a little while , we cut it in half .
now , looking back on that night , i &apos;d love so desperately to believe that i treated that woman on that night with the same empathy and compassion i &apos;d shown the 27-year-old newlywed who came to the e.r. three nights earlier with lower back pain that turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer .
what shapes are the trees ?
that &apos;s something we ought to celebrate .
you may recognize her .
in our day , we have digitization . that strips all the physical mass out of information , so now it &apos;s almost zero cost to copy and share information .
em : i did build rockets when i was a kid , but i didn &apos;t think i &apos;d be involved in this .
you wouldn &apos;t have expected that a few years back .
this is the worst presented information .
i hope that what you &apos;ve learned is that bacteria can distinguish self from other .
they learned to record the information that was the recipe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called dna .
in the middle we have a motor , and we also have a gear in it , and we use the gear to transfer the circulation of the motor .
we are limited by the space on our bench , the number of hands in the lab and the number of coffees we can drink in any given hour .
instead of 600 , immediately i &apos;m saving 200 grand .
now here &apos;s the deal .
and this is in anaheim , california , and it &apos;s a freeway building .
why are we building these headquarters ?
everybody begins to move around , and your task is to keep track of who had a coat at the beginning and who didn &apos;t . so i &apos;m just going to show you an example where there is only one sad kid . it &apos;s easy because you can actually track it with your eyes . you can track , you can track , and then when it stops , and there is a question mark , and i ask you , did this kid have a coat or not ?
this next chart , made by the equality trust , shows 21 countries from austria to japan to new zealand .

and you can arrange these things as kind of more for encampments and more of a city grid type layout , or you can circle the wagons , essentially , and form these circular pods out of them , which give you this semi-private communal area for people to actually spill out into so they &apos;re not actually trapped inside these units .
and some of them proudly raise their hand and say , &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t use a car . &quot; &quot; and then i put the really tough question : &quot; &quot; how many of you hand-wash your jeans and your bed sheets ? &quot; &quot; and no one raised their hand .
and the basic punchline of my talk is , i &apos;d like to turn that over on its head .
that was one of the funnest moments of my career .
i want to ask you , why do you think this is ?

and they actually take items of clothing and photographs , and they burn them as part of the ritual .
it drives people from the smart part of the brain — that dark , deep well of the subconscious , where instincts and experience , and all the other factors of creativity and good judgment are — it drives us to the thin veneer of conscious logic .
so , show the original picture for 240 milliseconds . blank .
so here is the world in 2015 .
going forward , imagine a massively parallel version of this with thousands of pieces of human tissue .
so , it &apos;s quite appropriate that this section is called a marketplace .

crimer show &apos;s creator has said that it is a parody of a popular type of show in the u.k. , but , man , is it weird .

it &apos;s going to take more money .
it &apos;s a really expensive organ to run .

so , you can &apos;t leave your normal metal tools out because you &apos;ll get a first-degree burn if you grab them sometimes .

but for a long time we couldn &apos;t quite figure out : wow can we get these kinds of video inputs ?
and the most magnificent part of all that is to go outside on a spacewalk .
they told me , &apos; we saw your mom on facebook .
because the experiments i &apos;ve shown you so far were done with a camera , a high-speed camera , that can record video about a 100 times faster than most cell phones , but we &apos;ve also found a way to use this technique with more regular cameras , and we do that by taking advantage of what &apos;s called a rolling shutter .

they are flexible enough that they can be folded to fit into the catheter , so the doctor can implant it directly on top of the tumor with minimally invasive surgery .
no , there is one more inequity . look there , united states .
and what they do is , when there are many ants in a small space , then each one can search very thoroughly because there will be another ant nearby searching over there , but when there are a few ants in a large space , then they need to stretch out their paths to cover more ground .
in its membrane , or its boundary , it contains little proteins that indeed can convert light into electricity .
well today , for the first time , our environment is starting to talk back to us .

tim berners-lee : can you say &quot; &quot; data &quot; &quot; ?
well , chances are i &apos;ve got a droid who &apos;s picking up the phone , &quot; yes , they called , and they said they didn &apos;t like it . &quot;

what will they do tomorrow ?
sperm donors are often referred to as &quot; &quot; biological fathers , &quot; &quot; but should we really be using the word &quot; &quot; father ? &quot; &quot; as a philosopher and social scientist , i have been studying these questions about the concept of parenthood .
but some of our grandchildren probably will .
but what it tells me is that , at a time when there &apos;s more — there &apos;s a greater abundance of information than there ever has been , it &apos;s harder to filter , we have greater tools .
and finally , free . free is really , really interesting .

this is a reverse view of things from the kind of traditional romantic view .
but based on the positions , they took the educated leap of faith to do so .
this turns out to be something that &apos;s predicted by a very complicated type of game theory you should come to graduate school at caltech and learn about .
the biggest anteater in the world lives in the rain forest , tips the scale at 90 pounds .
early in that process , one of the engineers had gone to bill and said , &quot; &quot; we &apos;re all too busy for this inefficient system of running parallel experiments . &quot; &quot; but as the process unfolded , he began to understand the wisdom of allowing talented people to play out their passions .
big problems need big solutions , sparked by big ideas , imagination and audacity , but also solutions that work .

this is an image from an exhibit which is currently conducted in geneva with that type of system .
clouds seldom visit this area .
it &apos;s bushfelt region , which is dry and prone to a lot of fires , as so what these trees have done is , if you can imagine that this is the crown of the tree , and that this is ground level , imagine that the whole thing , that whole bulk of the tree , migrated underground , and you just have those leaves peeping up above the surface .
( laughter ) a key thing was how people would interact .
this photograph , which i took at the orphanage of one of the classrooms , shows a sign which i had translated when i got home .
but i would have to introduce the band over this rolling vamp , and when i got around to steve , i &apos;d often find myself stuck on the &quot; &quot; st. &quot; &quot; and it was a bit awkward and uncomfortable and it totally kills the vibe .
what are you doing that &apos;s different than other efforts to balance rights for gun ownership and responsibilities ?

and we have ... this computer screen can actually see the mosquitoes as they fly around .
the red dots are going to be cases of the flu , and the yellow dots are going to be friends of the people with the flu .
at least the exponential growth of information technology capability will continue unabated .

nothing thrills me more than to see kids pollinating plants instead of each other .
but eventually , no matter how good you are at digging up the church records , and all that stuff , you hit what the genealogists call a brick wall .
he jumps back and there , of course , is the future buddha maitreya in a beautiful vision — rainbow lights , golden , jeweled , a plasma body , an exquisite mystic vision — that he sees .
now , in fact , a single mosquito will only travel about 200 yards in its entire life . they don &apos;t travel very far .
our humanity is actually defined by technology .
now , modern slavery : according to state department rough statistics , there are about 800,000 — 10 times the number — that are trafficked across international borders .
&quot; i have to get that . i need more . i &apos;m not worthy . and i should do something . &quot;
maybe we should see how they do with losses .
all industrial designers work within constraints .
in 2011 , we first released some of these images , and what was funny was , a lot of people said to us , &quot; &quot; oh , it kind of looks like the high line underground . &quot; &quot; and so what our nickname ended up becoming , and what ended up sticking , was the lowline , so the lowline was born .
she would shut the door to the living room , and i imagined magical things happened in that room .
and we have a lot of skill and experience , but it &apos;s a trick , so how are you supposed to prepare to get through that glass ceiling ?
she got diabetes . case closed .
( laughter ) oh , they broke my frame .
now , i try to stay relatively hip to the latest trends and memes , so i knew that &quot; &quot; yo , bitch &quot; &quot; was also often a common greeting between friends , as well as being a popular &quot; &quot; breaking bad &quot; &quot; reference .
it would be terrible .
since then i &apos;ve also co-founded two other social enterprises .
in fact , these names start coming up over and over again .
open source software , these guys decided they didn &apos;t want copyright protection .
that was eradicated , so that got down to zero .
we started with a natural occurring clay called montmorillonite .
thank you .
i found my magical ants , but only after a tough climb into the mountains where the last of the native cuban forests hung on , and were then — and still are — being cut back .
we used a measure of ecological diversity to get this .
one hundred thirty-four commissions and semi-autonomous government bodies , all of which have directors and the cars . and the final thing , this is addressed to mr. bono . in his work , he may help us on this .
well in order to accommodate that , you would have to cut education spending in half .
that was essential for advancing treatment for hiv in the late 1980s .
those organisms that paired with fungi were rewarded , because fungi do not need light .
seti doesn &apos;t presume the existence of extra terrestrial intelligence ; it merely notes the possibility , if not the probability in this vast universe , which seems fairly uniform .
but if you think of where i &apos;m from , in the south , in appalachia , in southern ohio , it &apos;s very unlikely that kids like that will rise .
they fly in and they pollinate .
some last just for a day or two , and some for more than a week .
it &apos;s a smooth expansion .
is it just about grievances ?
similarly , we have small manufacturing companies making conscious decisions to relocate to the city .
and depending on which one weighs which amount , they &apos;ll fall different directions .
what is that ?
i mean , this nautical almanac published the lunar differences for every month of the year .
and the logo — even though it looks extremely irish , it &apos;s actually derived from the indian symbol of diya , an earthen lamp .
if i asked you to think of the ideas of al-qaeda , that &apos;s something that comes to your mind immediately .

various parts of the world will have a cult food that people get enormously attached to — there &apos;s tremendous traditions , there &apos;s secrecy .
we &apos;ve tried to kill cells using a variety of chemotherapies or targeted therapies , and as most of us know , that &apos;s worked .
this story , like many of the stories in my chapters , reads almost as an archetypal episode , like something out of shakespeare , that &apos;s happening now and will happen again in the future .
and in order to get these kinds of computations started right , you need some kind of input , a kind of seed .
who knew that chasing after the universe would ground me so deeply to my mission here on earth .
this technology affected two organs , the brain and the gut , which it actually affected .
so what i want to share with you now are some of the experiments that myself and my colleagues have used to investigate how dung beetles deal with these problems .
the buildings here are multi-story .
they let their freak flag fly and it &apos;s beautiful .
it &apos;s boring . um , who cares , and it sucks . &quot; &quot; these sympathetic smiles spread all throughout the room now , and i realize that all of my other students are in the same boat , that maybe they took notes or they memorized definitions from the textbook , but not one of them really understood the main ideas .
stories are everywhere , and if there was a danger in the telling of one tired old tale , then i think there has got to be lots to celebrate about the flourishing of so many stories and so many voices .
i just want to end by saying that technology is absolutely critical to managing our planet , but even more important is the understanding and wisdom to apply it .
you can feel just fine while high blood pressure ravages your most vital organs .
now , besides programming these beautiful patterns , i wondered , what else can we get these bacteria to do ?
but jennifer lee starts to question whether that makes sense .
but some people really struggle with that .
i was fortunate to find a dentist who applied this entire universe of technology you &apos;re about to see to establish that if he repositioned my jaw , the headaches pretty much resolved , but that then my teeth weren &apos;t in the right place .
but we thought maybe — well , we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground .

the rest will grow older and get two billion children .
it happened 225 years ago .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s moist , it &apos;s very cozy .
and if you think about it , all of the weird weather we &apos;ve been having the last few years , much of that is due to just one degree warming , and we need co2 emissions to peak by the end of this decade globally and then come down .
you can actually get really good-looking books for on the order of one penny per page , sort of the parts cost for doing this .
when you hear a name that you don &apos;t recognize , you can &apos;t tell me anything about them , i &apos;d like you to take a seat and stay seated .

canopied trees as tall as 40 meters , 130 feet , grow densely in the area .
it &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference .
so far , most people who have lived have also died .
it &apos;s still with that glass box because we still want that visual access , but now it &apos;s sheathed with this thermo-bimetal layer , it &apos;s a screen that goes around it , and that layer can actually open and close as that sun moves around on that surface .
the first step is pattern recognition .
( laughter ) we have jami from hungary , who first starts making weapons : he &apos;s the technology wiz .
when we look at the demographic shifts of people coming from the west , it appears that what we &apos;re seeing now is the wrath of grapes .
and in that process that &apos;s going to morph from being just for diseases , to being for lesser vulnerabilities , like risk of manic depression or something , to picking personalities , temperaments , traits , these sorts of things .
we are therefore not powerless to solve it .
and then with a lot of effort , after tagging , putting in the computer , making sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment , we send this fish back into the sea .
not only can they do it very well , they do it in a sort of lazy way .
and then about three and a half minutes before launch , the huge nozzles on the back , like the size of big church bells , swing back and forth and the mass of them is such that it sways the whole vehicle , like the vehicle is alive underneath you , like an elephant getting up off its knees or something .
and that &apos;s where i became truly obsessed with this polar realm .
that the truth consists of hard to vary assertions about reality is the most important fact about the physical world .
but i also wanted to follow the hundreds of arcane and obscure laws that are in the bible .
so what i want to argue is this is one example of where a systematic , really scientific approach can actually bring you a real understanding of pheromones .
and then we reverse the current .
drove the pilings against the tide of the sand , plank by plank .
in fact , many migrants have made a decision , out of economic need , to place themselves into the hands of people smugglers .
that udo is from argentina has largely to do with history .
respectable people kept slaves .
so i went off to the states , as many people do if they &apos;re going to do research , and i spent a few years in pittsburgh . this is pittsburgh .
only girls are secretary of state . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) ( applause ) pm : because in her lifetime — ma : that would be so .
they have an objective to lowering the cost of connectivity .
&#91; regardless of &#93; how transparent our governments want to be , they &apos;re going to be selectively transparent .

if the family &apos;s poor , they find it difficult to visit , and gradually the relationship breaks down .
( laughter ) i had to have long conversations with my wife . ( laughter )
you get an eggbeater , which is everywhere , and you saw off a blade , and then you take tubing , and you stick it on that . you put the blood in , you spin it — somebody sits there and spins it .

and suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self .
my mother worked hard in the farm to grow crops so that we can eat .
i am your remaining memory .
well , it &apos;s pretty simple .
and if we &apos;re smart , we &apos;ll look at this stuff that &apos;s going on , and we &apos;ll figure out a way to enable it to inform and infuse both what we design and how we design .
and we &apos;ve since gone on to develop many generations of gadgets for exploring places like this .
and you see these recipes on the side ?
i was a home-birth midwife throughout my 20s .
that &apos;s a case of microphthalmos , which is malformed eyes , and that &apos;s a permanent condition ; it cannot be treated .
once change became my totalizing faith , i could be blind .

it &apos;s a three sided box , basically .
gene &apos;s been restoring this car for a million years .
for example , in polite requests , if someone says , &quot; &quot; if you could pass the guacamole , that would be awesome , &quot; &quot; we know exactly what he means , even though that &apos;s a rather bizarre concept being expressed .
but in fact , if that &apos;s how you always were you &apos;d never get any work done because you &apos;d be working along and say , &quot; &quot; oh , i got a new way of doing it . &quot; &quot; so to get work done , you &apos;ve got to set a deadline , right ?
so the memorial opened in 2011 , and the museum &apos;s going to open next year in 2014 .
so apparently , i &apos;ve got a pretty bold voice .

so , the answer is bio-mimicry : just copy nature directly .
i &apos;ve often wondered : what was he thinking ?
so i was a little slow , and i did not trust technology , and when they first came out with those new contraptions , these tellers that you put in a card and they give you money , i was like , &quot; &quot; there &apos;s no way that machine is going to count that money right .
when people ask you , &quot; &quot; what is the evidence for evolution ? &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t have to think about some exotic examples , or fossils .
so we light our buildings with daylight .
and thanks to deworm the world , and the effort of many country governments and foundations , 20 million school-aged children got dewormed in 2009 .
it took them 10 full prototypes to get something that would actually fly .
and here was myself trying not to get wet , testing the sensors that open the water .
it was , for a long time , revered as the most reliable of cars , and then they had the big recall incident .
as with many other important innovations , those radical ideas required no new technology , just fresh thinking and a willingness to experiment , plus resiliency in the face of near-universal criticism and rejection .
what am i going to get ?
the good thing about our lab is , we &apos;ve had 3,600 visitors in the last two years .
it was very easy to remember seeing dogs , not so easy to remember pigs . and each one of you assumed that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind , then dogs on leashes are more probable .
there &apos;s so little compromise on this , you can &apos;t see it .
and i was really struck by how much it affected me .
behind each of the million children in institutions , there is usually a story of parents who are desperate and feel they &apos;ve run out of options , like natalia in moldova , who only had enough money to feed her baby , and so had to send her older son to the institution ; or desi , in bulgaria , who looked after her four children at home until her husband died , but then she had to go out to work full time , and with no support , felt she had no option but to place a child with disabilities in an institution ; or the countless young girls too terrified to tell their parents
you know , we just celebrated , this year , our general elections , the biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history .
but to be a great photojournalist , you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you .
as we think about this , probably it &apos;s better to actually go a little deeper into one particular disorder , and that would be schizophrenia , because i think that &apos;s a good case for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters .
i am no designer , nope , no way .
one of the people who gets to step out on the ledge and look down but not jump , one of the lucky ones who survives .
really dig . we hid them under there .
we can &apos;t get along with other people , even in our own families .
that changes everything , right ?
but this is actually a talk about , okay — ( laughter ) — but this is actually a talk about fission .
( video ) cl : mike , come on in .
and she had to go along just to be with her sister for company , and in that process , she made a number of decisions .
now , another term called shuffle tracking .
he suffered from anxiety , poor appetite , sleep disturbance and showed signs of anger .
in this way , we can turn everyday objects into microphones .
and this is our new baby , called tonkene .
when a cafe in sydney was taken over by a terrorist , he went in with a rifle ...
what we do , my students in my lab and i , is we buy barbies from goodwill and value village , we dress her in clothes that have been made by seamstresses and we send her out with a canopy handbook .
but in reality , in the course of the coming weeks and months , hundreds of thousands of people came to see the show .
it &apos;s not that easy . it &apos;s an artichoke .
now there is a case to be made that control freaks and perfectionists should not get tattoos , and i &apos;m going to return to that point in a few minutes .
it will stratify society as much as it liberates it .
woman : you &apos;re asking me a hard question .
and she doesn &apos;t want me to come and visit .
so this was a great project .
and so that &apos;s a picture from pearl harbor just grafted onto los angeles .
we started our media lab , sounds like a real great story .
that is , combining two or more fields and creating something new at the intersection .
and importantly , we need to reallocate the few specialists who are available to perform roles such as capacity-building and supervision .
we look at it every single day . &quot; &quot; so i said , &quot; &quot; what ? you don &apos;t understand these screens and you keep staring at it for two months ? what for ? &quot; &quot; so a little girl who you see just now , she raised her hand , and she says to me in broken tamil and english , she said , &quot; &quot; well , apart from the fact that improper replication of the dna molecule causes disease , we haven &apos;t understood anything else . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) ( applause ) so i tested them .
if you want to know how , ask yourself this question : what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail ?
on tononi &apos;s theory , there &apos;s still going to be a non-zero degree of consciousness .
all buildings today have something in common .
it worked out .
the pavilion &apos;s design goal was to be kind of quiet and peaceful .
in this box is a standard , off-the-shelf led lamp .
so all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure — i &apos;m going back now to , sort of , the explosive part of the web in 1994 , when it was growing 2,300 percent a year .
in the long run , that &apos;s bad news , so researchers are working on finding alternatives to control these mites .
a gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity of us having to leave the continent so that we can fulfill our potential .
we have the ability to do that , and i think it &apos;s going to work .
and so perhaps once they cleaned up the pigeon droppings , get the disk kind of operational again , normal operations would resume .
but we really need to get to grips with the numbers to work out how to do it .
my job was to ask this question : &quot; what do the stories look like ? &quot;
so investing in environmental protection did not hurt our economy .
and it turns out the web is awash with this sort of evidence that supports this sort of thinking .
the first thing i &apos;m going to tell you about this mammal is that it is essential for our ecosystems to function correctly .
your uniform is maintained to the inch .
( applause ) when the dalai lama heard that , he told richard davidson , &quot; you go to 10 schools , 100 schools , the u.n. , the whole world . &quot;
but in order to look at mobility and locomotion at this size scale to start , we &apos;re cheating and using magnets .
it &apos;s full of different melodies . ( laughter ) yeah .
so he led us through the process of creating a family mission statement .
one day , he had an argument with his father , and he yelled , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re telling me what to do ?
so we decided — actually , the highlight &apos;s right there . oh , thank you .
when i took over this , i tried to really figure out , like , what my vision would be .
i want to see the day when cancer is treated easily because it can be routinely diagnosed at the very early stages , and i &apos;m certain that in the very near future , because of this and other breakthroughs that we are seeing every day in the life sciences , the way we see cancer will radically change .
one out of 10 experiments has any success .
something had gone wrong with the lion tamer .
ok . we &apos;ve heard a lot of people speak at this conference about the power of the human mind .
i think things like , &quot; &quot; oh ! i know — i must clean the floor .
well today i want to present to you an idea that may be surprising and may even seem implausible , but which is supported by the latest evidence from psychology and biology .
and it really impressed me — i met him two weeks after he got out of prison — that he went through that experience , and ended up with the demeanor that he had .
i ’ m not talking about james cameron — although i could , but i won ’ t .
i would carry their golf bags up to the top , and they &apos;d pay me a dollar .
so they actually transform the entire island into a single ecosystem .
we happen to know , there &apos;s a list of catharina , the wife &apos;s clothes .
there are incredible possibilities with this as a way for creative people to share at light speed .
there was none in place — no association , no ngos , nothing — no eyewitnesses .
this is a piece of multi-year ice that &apos;s 12 years old .
i was so happy — ( applause ) — that my sister was alive !
you cannot turn them off with a switch .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this genetic code , made the viral particles .
you &apos;ve got people in white hats making food .
hiding is a progressive habit , and once you start hiding , it becomes harder and harder to step forward and speak out .
maybe you think , it &apos;s his phone .
the real issue is that child is living with 12 other people in a two-bedroom apartment .
and it &apos;s only by giving people access and letting them choose what to do that you get those sweeping changes that we have seen globally — except for sub-saharan africa and those places in south asia and afghanistan .
i know , you need to get rid of that seed first . can you sing ?
it &apos;s a very complicated ecology .
i don &apos;t think this segment of the market can be addressed by companies parachuting from another place of the world , and just dumping product and selling into the markets .
it took weeks for us to really get to what happened to her when she was in that house , but finally she started opening up to me , and when she opened up , what i heard was she didn &apos;t know what her rights were , but she did know she had a certain level of protection by her government that failed her , and so we were able to talk about what her legal options were .
i had finally gotten my chance and i blew it , and i knew i would never get invited back .
they also wore body armor .
although we don &apos;t have statistics for warfare throughout the middle ages to modern times , we know just from conventional history — the evidence was under our nose all along that there has been a reduction in socially sanctioned forms of violence .
this swallows the bridge and knocks it down .
and we think — and this is , i think , very exciting — that in the next five years or so we may be able to test for the existence of these extra dimensions .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened .
and bright young africans are desperate to join the global community , to be successful — and they &apos;re very ambitious .
we &apos;d be growing oysters and things that would be producing high value products and food , and this would be a market driver as we build the system to larger and larger scales so that it becomes , ultimately , competitive with the idea of doing it for fuels .
we are missing the story of nehia , a palestinian woman in gaza who , the minute there was a cease-fire in the last year &apos;s war , she left out of home , collected all the flour and baked as much bread for every neighbor to have , in case there is no cease-fire the day after . we are missing
put a price on carbon . we need a co2 tax , revenue neutral , to replace taxation on employment , which was invented by bismarck — and some things have changed since the 19th century .
&quot; &quot; i know , &quot; &quot; i said . &quot; &quot; i &apos;m aware of this custom .
and this is a movement where — this is started by a psychologist in virginia , who says that you should never , ever lie , except maybe during poker and golf , his only exceptions .
for the next three dozen years as king , this king actually started measuring and managing around happiness in bhutan — including , just recently , taking his country from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy with no bloodshed , no coup .
it turned out that it wasn &apos;t , that it really is a system of motivation , a system of wanting .
in fact , take these technologies and push them to their logical extreme .
we remove ourselves from our grief or from our revery and we go into our phones .
our design was something in between a building and a house .
it &apos;s easy to imagine how particularly those parts of our bodies were quickly influenced by selection from the environment and shifted frequencies of genes that are involved in them .
that was the first concept here .
you have everything that you could ever need .
what we learn is that changing models is hard .
these children are quickly labeled as having disabilities and transferred to another institution for children with disabilities .
all i &apos;m asking is for forgiveness .
it &apos;s a bit of a personal example , in fact .
my second story is remarkable as well .
but other examples are traffic jams , stock market , society and disaster recovery , terrorism and insurgency .
( applause ) the thing i did — i peeked .
a key attribute of our nanopatch is that the vaccine is dry , and when it &apos;s dry it doesn &apos;t need refrigeration .
she &apos;s very glamorous but , you know , she invented spread-spectrum technology .
we aren &apos;t focused on any particular problem , and we &apos;re not trying to solve any particular disease .
turn off your air conditioning , turn on your fans .
five thousand products — that &apos;s still nothing . five thousand products —
and it sees multiple people in a scene , remembers where individual people are , and looks from person to person , remembering people .
so the robot takes over the dangerous jobs .
and if there are organics there , there may be life .
so it will not allow us to control a memory in real time .
we stumbled on it , looking for some missing heat .
and i &apos;m here to tell you , it &apos;s wrong .
there is nothing about him that says , &quot; i am about to fight you like this . &quot;
not to say that it shouldn &apos;t have , but that we have to get better at answering the questions that need to be considered when we think about consequences and responses .
so when people ask me how i continue to cover war , and why i continue to do it , this is why .
bono : all right . i wish for ted to truly show the power of information , its power to rewrite the rules and transform lives , by connecting every hospital , health clinic and school in one african country .
so she is just one amongst the millions who are blind .
so what &apos;s next ?
( laughter ) but if you do accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
we use the notion of color .
these weapons affect the poorest of the poor .
do we get to create organic robots , where we remove the autonomy from these animals and turn them just into our playthings ?
pictures were taken every day : day one , day two ...
by using this engaging popular format for traditional , local culture , it actually , in the gulf , is precipitating a revival of interest in nabati poetry , also in traditional dress and dance and music .
the discovery that these animals can also use medication opens up completely new avenues , and i think that maybe one day , we will be treating human diseases with drugs that were first discovered by butterflies , and i think that is an amazing opportunity worth pursuing .
and in germany , if you would like to donate your organs — god forbid something really bad happens to you — when you get your driving license or an i.d. , you check the box saying , &quot; i would like to donate my organs . &quot;
and that &apos;s a story i &apos;m going to tell you about today .
the first one was barnett shale in texas and then the marcellus up in the northeast across new york , pennsylvania , west virginia ; and haynesville in louisiana .
whenever they do anything , you just say , &apos; well , wow , i mean , how did you do that ?
you want to be transgressed .
and that &apos;s interesting , because it means that just the mechanics already stabilized this quite rapid gait , and that really good mechanics already basically simplify locomotion .
they were pragmatic .
where do they get their water ? where do they get their shelter ?
but if we look at companies like puma — jochen zeitz , their ceo and chairman , once challenged me at a function , saying that he &apos;s going to implement my project before i finish it .
so we started giving back .
those kind of stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress .
and the second question is related , but slightly different .
and they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this .
but for that , the countries at entry points need to be massively supported , and then screening the people with security checks and all the other mechanisms , distributing those that are coming into all european countries , according to the possibilities of each country .
the sandworms were fine , but your favorite character ?
the real question is , how can markets be developed in rural africa to harness the power of innovation and entrepreneurship that we know exists ?
it is essential for success .
and many organisms fit this kind of pattern .
so i &apos;m just a lawyer , i look at this range of numbers , and i say it &apos;s fair for me to say it &apos;s .05 percent who are our relevant funders in america .
( laughter ) nick was a young student .
and if the answer that we get from our calculations agrees with the values of those numbers that have been determined through detailed and precise experimentation , this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation for why the structure of the universe is the way it is .
there &apos;s all kinds of different things that you can imagine for that .
you think about the driverless .
we discovered a new behavior where , because of their shape , they actually roll automatically to their side to go through this artificial test bit of grass .
&quot; can i just sit in and see what you do ? &quot;
and you &apos;ve only got about seven days to capture 50 percent of all of the web searches that will ever be made to help your area .
so surely if a patent pool could be established to ramp up the production of military airplanes , we should be able to do something similar to tackle the hiv / aids epidemic .
and the women that were hired , usually for secretarial or front-office work , were all white .
but the thing that really amazed me , that i had no idea , was that you could suffer in this way and then have your whole experience , your story , denied , buried and forgotten .
information technology grows in an exponential manner .
this top light is — i &apos;m sorry if i &apos;m making you seasick — this top light is actually a water quality display that shifts from red , when the dissolved oxygen is low , to a blue / green , when its dissolved oxygen is high .
by the way , who &apos;s holding al gore &apos;s phone ?
we inject our own aerosols into the atmosphere , and we have trace gases , and not just carbon dioxide — it &apos;s methane , ozone , oxides of sulfur and nitrogen .
but all that belief had fueled me so long .
&quot; &quot; i &apos;m a local of lagos and berlin , &quot; &quot; suggests overlapping experiences , layers that merge together , that can &apos;t be denied or removed .
in fact , they were so rare that elected members of parliament had the right to allocate 15 telephone lines as a favor to those they deemed worthy .
( laughter ) ( applause ) now that is called the huf haus .
&quot; &quot; what safeguards , &quot; &quot; i asked , &quot; &quot; do you have to make sure that your black box isn &apos;t doing something shady ? &quot; &quot; she looked at me as if i had just stepped on 10 puppy tails .
and i can tell you exactly who i was with , where i was , because this is what i had to do with the fbi .
they start looking like planets .
2011 , in july , two &#91; unclear &#93; trains crashed , in wenzhou , a southern city .
there are now between two and three million daily users of the tor browser , the majority of which use is perfectly legitimate , sometimes even mundane .
and then , of course , design is never done .
all this , before it ever got near a computer .
so that &apos;s getting a lot of interest , and to show you some example of what we did in there , we actually dropped a probe , which was developed by our colleagues in europe , we dropped a probe as we were orbiting saturn .
what nfb wanted was not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around , but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive .
if you &apos;ve never written a line of code before in your life , do not worry .
it turns out that our first microbial communities depend a lot on how we &apos;re born .
the second thing that we learned is that individuals matter , and they matter enormously .
and these animals live in remarkably beautiful places , and in some cases , caves like this , that are very young , yet the animals are ancient .
not because it &apos;s monotone and concrete , but because of what it symbolizes : a monster that feeds off the rest of the country , where citizens are soldiers and slaves .
you can buy cloned cologne .
we had a guest stay with a host in uruguay , and he suffered a heart attack .
please welcome naná vasconcelos .
we moved from that to becoming farmers and cultivators of information .
what is origami ?
and it was here , about 10,000 years ago , that two extraordinary inventions , agriculture and urbanism , happened roughly in the same place and at the same time .
so african agriculture , which is the place of most hunger in the world , has actually fallen precipitously as hunger has risen .
the incorporated side , the company , is doing things that it does really well .
there &apos;s no law that &apos;s been passed specifically authorizing this technique , and because of its power and potential for abuse , it &apos;s vital that we have an informed public debate .
they are sold in the name of adoption .
he has a theory of how the overall clock experience should work .
so what we do is take all these data from all these different days and pool them together to extract a long-term association pattern by applying techniques with network analysis to get a complete picture of the social structure of the colony .
business should give more .
so what you have is one giant , interconnected , genetically identical individual that &apos;s been living for 80,000 years .
like muti . you ready ? because muti ...
using this process , pioneers in the industry are layering up cells today .
you &apos;ve got to institutionalize a system where you actually invite the kosovars to come and tell you what they think .
so when you &apos;re done surveying , you take all this data and you punch it into a computer and you find someone that can draw really well , and you have them draft up a map that looks something like this , and it &apos;ll show you both a bird &apos;s-eye view of the passage as well as a profile view of the passage , kind of like an ant farm view .
( laughter ) such it is with commitment devices .
it &apos;s not english . it &apos;s noisy english .
and this was somebody who had incredible potential to spread aspects of our message , whether it be with regards to wildlife conservation or health prevention .
every line between them is a relationship between two people — different kinds of relationships .
for example , we actually started asking our employees , do they understand the mission of our company , and do they feel like they believe in it , can they actually influence it , and do they feel that their work actually has an impact on it ?
puppy-sized elephant , all the way down to mr. tusks and beyond .
( laughter ) and so there was the paper , and he proposed a three-stranded structure .
he wrote very , very positive reviews about himself . surprise , surprise .
&quot; hurray ! my boy finally started to lie ! &quot;
and she assigned one of the older kids to each of the younger kids .
let me show you a couple of examples here .
on may 11th last year , i stood alone at the north geographic pole .
it &apos;s not a common little river that flows into a canal .
or think about being in new york city and tracking down an intelligent cab on your smart phone so you don &apos;t have to wait in the cold to hail one .
when , all of a sudden , a girl way in the back of the auditorium , she stood up and she said , &quot; &quot; miss !
i love when i &apos;m in the laboratory , a new spider silk sequence comes in .
already , we can see that apple and microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design .
equally untidy office there , as you can see .
and that &apos;s not just about me , that &apos;s about so many other michiganders , u.s. citizens , who don &apos;t understand why what they are is so much more significant than who they are .
so look at this little picture .
( laughter ) but i never became a designer . no , no , no , no . never attempted . never even close .
a couple of years later — so i get really excited about these things — about a couple of years later , there was a 13-month-old , she was from canada .
take a look at the second door and see if there &apos;s any different message .
and at this stage , if that &apos;s — so far everything sounded , like , pretty crazy — you &apos;re now about to face the most challenging decision of your life here .
i mean , because we , at this point , we can protect it .
if either of them be unwilling , the act is an offense , totally different in its nature of effects .
and that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today .
and you do that for a while , until you really feel that .
and that idea is that from the germ &apos;s-eye point of view , disease organisms have to get from one host to another , and often they have to rely on the well-being of the host to move them to another host .
there &apos;s no dinosaurs yet ; just this slow , saurian , scaly , nasty , swampy place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes .
also , the way i perceive beauty has changed , because when i look at someone , i hear their face , so someone might look very beautiful but sound terrible .
now today we treat high blood pressure mostly with pills .
( laughter ) if i controlled the internet , you could auction your broken heart on ebay .
now one of the things that — what happened when i went into berkeley is i realized that , you know , this was all pretty amazing to people , very , very different , and i needed to market it .
but i was about to leave the school , because my poor mother couldn &apos;t afford schooling .
the breakfast that we eat as we sit down to check our email in the morning is still transported at great distances , usually at the expense of the local , more resilient food systems that would have supplied that in the past , which we &apos;ve so effectively devalued and dismantled .
and here you can see these wooden effigies of the ancestors , so these are people who have already been buried , already had a funeral ceremony .
and i think that people have legitimate concerns about the balance between transparency and secrecy .
these losses , they feel , emotionally , they feel very different from what we actually thought about it when markets were going up . &quot; &quot; so we &apos;re probably not doing a great job when it comes to risk taking .
now , in their religiosity , in their naivete , my mom and dad , which i believed them to be forever , as they said they were , my mom and dad conceived that i had the devil inside of me .
that &apos;s twice as many numbers as words that each of us speaks in a lifetime .
now &apos;s a chance for dimitri to kind of reassure and calm milo down .
and he worked on what were to become these nine health goals — what were we aiming at ?
now albert einstein is not some dead white guy with weird hair .
this is a kind of a blowing straw .
let &apos;s talk about what scale looks like at twitter .
it labels &quot; &quot; developing countries , &quot; &quot; — i can read from the list here — developing countries : republic of korea — south korea .
this nation will become great again .
there is great confusion when the two look at each other .
ladies and gentleman , this was one of the most concerning international emergencies in public health we &apos;ve ever seen .
and for years , we &apos;ve thought that leaders were heroic soloists who were expected , all by themselves , to solve complex problems .
it has a fairly substantial number of asteroids between the orbit of the earth out through — to the orbit of jupiter .
everything there is about the great leader .
and broadly applicable across many platforms .
it took him three months .
what if , out there , others are asking and answering similar questions ?
and the cell on the right there fires whenever there &apos;s a boundary to the south , whether it &apos;s the drop at the edge of the table or a wall or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart .
and they may start to make their way through one of the valleys of the shephelah up into the mountains , because what they want to do is occupy the highland area right by bethlehem and split the kingdom of israel in two .
in sri lanka , a decades-long civil war between the tamil minority and the sinhala majority led to a bloody climax in 2009 , after perhaps as many as 100,000 people had been killed since 1983 .
there are three reasons why this is the case .
and i think that there &apos;s theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them .
now , the vast majority of activity on twitter puts no one in harm &apos;s way .
that kind of beautiful language only goes &quot; &quot; skin deep , but ugly cuts clean to the bone , &quot; &quot; as the writer dorothy parker once put it .
it serves no good purpose .
it has never been done .
i was born with some form of disease .
and we do care about planets like the earth because by now we understood that life as a chemical system really needs a smaller planet with water and with rocks and with a lot of complex chemistry to originate , to emerge , to survive .
and we can walk through the reasons for that , but basically the small cell took on the order of one to two months to get results from , whereas the larger , faster-growing cell takes only two days .
woman : i &apos;d make my very own walking stick .
my dad , john ferren , who died when i was 15 , was an artist by both passion and profession , as is my mom , rae .
but we began with the idea of one child at a time .
the reason we envisioned using the crispr system for genome engineering is because cells have the ability to detect broken dna and repair it .
and my message goes out not only to google , but to all believers in the faith of code around the world .
because if enough people do it , we can change society &apos;s definition of success away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins , to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like .
it was a little reckless , but you know , i was 16 .
and i was part of that .
in fact , it &apos;s one of the biggest problems with chemotherapy today .
so we said , &quot; &quot; well , these will be on round tables and the order around the table had to be the same , so that at my site , i would be , if you will , real and then at each other &apos;s site you &apos;d have these plastic heads .
third , someone has something you &apos;ve never even heard of before .
and it raises an existential question , which is , if i &apos;m having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness , why am i not visible in the photograph , and where is this time and place ?
and this is called the three-to-one positive emotion ratio .
all of us are makers .
well we clearly need something that is effective at reducing the mosquito population .
now , when he speaks about plants , everything is correct .
and it was my first trip to iceland that i felt like i found exactly what i was looking for .
i cannot tell you the hundreds of people who have said , &quot; if you don &apos;t like religion , just leave . &quot;
we are creating the next generation of m.d. &apos; s and engineers capable of translating discoveries all the way from bench to bedside .
well , ever since i was a kid , i &apos;d been thinking about systematizing knowledge and somehow making it computable .
well , i remember in third grade , i had this moment where my father , who never takes off from work , he &apos;s a classical blue collar , a working-class immigrant person , going to school to see his son , how he &apos;s doing , and the teacher said to him , he said , &quot; &quot; you know , john is good at math and art . &quot; &quot; and he kind of nodded , you know ?
they can throw out a target — it &apos;s a carpet shaped like a seal — and in will come a white shark , a curious critter that will come right up to our 16-ft. boat .
and to contrast that , you can see the most important institution in the world , the world bank , is an organization of the government , by the government , for the governments .
oil . oil . this was a big topic .
so what can we do ?
we don &apos;t know what that &apos;s going to do to you , not in the long term , and not even very much in the short term .
the market was so terribly disorganized that they were buying this medicine through two agents who were gigging them sevenfold .
a few months ago , a south african lawyer visited me in my office and he said , &quot; &quot; i wanted to meet you .
but the idea that we can gently grow there with a few minor hiccups is just wrong , and it &apos;s dangerously wrong , because it means we &apos;re not getting ready for what &apos;s really going to happen .
pshh , pouring rain , couldn &apos;t see a thing .
you run it through a new kind of printer called a wax printer .
and you know it &apos;s not real science unless you use guinea pigs , and apparently this guinea pig is called tiffany , and this youtube user claims it is the first rodent on earth that was motion-magnified .
greatest runner . she would challenge anybody .
they are telling their own story , bypassing the official narrative .
the tumor slowed their rate of growth , but they still grew rapidly , doubling in size over a period of two weeks .
and one of the things that &apos;s emerged in my short time here is that ted has an identity .
all of my time was spent outside with the inuit , playing .
and you &apos;ll say : &quot; &quot; ah , that &apos;s because there is a reason , here ! &quot; &quot; dear friends , i already heard all the reasons .
jh : thanks guys .
it was taken by this thing , which is called the voyager spacecraft .
i see wheelchairs bought and sold like used cars .
and you could do us a great service if you would add a culinary program to your program . &quot; &quot; because back then , we were building a trades program .
but it &apos;s a kind of indirect argument .
why are you so passionate ? &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; oh gayle , this is actually my third business .
well , african leaders , almost exclusively .
( laughter ) &quot; &quot; i found your camera at lollapalooza this summer .
we have the plants that are giving to the animals a kind of sweet substance — very energizing — having in change this transportation of the pollen .
and you can see that the green neuron touches the red neuron at two locations , and these are what are called synapses .
this professor used state-of-the-art photography equipment to record the site , forever changing the face of exploration .
i picked disney because they have what we call 100 percent penetration in our society .
if the al-qaeda base was to be established near ghazni , we would hit them very hard , and it would be very , very difficult for the taliban to protect them .
in some countries , you couldn &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s called rue des prairies — prairie street .
it &apos;s by astor piazzolla , an argentine composer .
danny makes it look as if a person &apos;s skin has actually been removed .
a hundred years ago , it &apos;s certainly true that to drive a car you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car and how the ignition timing worked and all sorts of things .
mk : i imagine being grateful , too , right ?
ten years later , i returned to kenya to do just that .
what issues deeply concern you ?
but another really important difference is how they get their greater equality .
and this is one of the things that we are looking for everywhere .
and even something as innocuous as a single-design chair , like this one by arne jacobsen , is a persuasive technology , because , again , it communicates an idea of the good life : a good life — a life that you , as a designer , consent to by saying , &quot; &quot; in a good life , goods are produced as sustainably or unsustainably as this chair .
we want to say , &quot; &quot; this is just the way it is .
this is different . here , we &apos;re talking about the communication of pertinent information to stakeholders of organizations : employees , customers , business partners , shareholders , and so on .
perhaps one should consider zodiac in reverse , as those tiger and goat babies will face much less competition .
well , we can go back to the network structure of ideas to do that .
we know this .
his name is nyota .
i was an outsider who had come back to iran to find my place , but i was not in a position to be critical of the government or the ideology of the islamic revolution .
it wasn &apos;t going to be our traditional residential neighborhoods as we had before , and urban agriculture , while a very productive and successful intervention happening in detroit , was not the only answer , that what we had to do is look at these areas where we had significant vacancy but still had a significant number of population of what could be new , productive , innovative , and entrepreneurial uses that could stabilize those communities , where still nearly 300,000 residents lived .
and people always say , &quot; &quot; why do that ?
that &apos;s better than a glowing chicken .
because we have 300 million microbloggers in china .
let me tell you the story of shriram , an 18 month boy in bihar , a northern state in india .
how come , then , it &apos;s not so expected to be selective when we go to an art gallery ?
we did the line install over the summer .
this is our delivery army , and we &apos;re just one organization .
okay . what if you think they &apos;re fighting ?
woman : you still have to report the incident .
i think i &apos;m from mars for them , and they are for me , but somehow we all manage to work together , and i think , productively .
now before i get into the details of how the voice is made and let you listen to it , i need to give you a real quick speech science lesson . okay ?
so for the climate , history may judge that the banking crisis happened at just the wrong time .
they look like tv cameras , monitors , annoying radio mics .
and the british people were still upset about losing the revolution , so they decided to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture of general washington in the only outhouse , where he &apos;d have to encounter it .
and there are thousands of other examples of this happening — of video-driven evolution of skills , ranging from the physical to the artful .
now you &apos;re thinking , give me a break .
man : you know how expensive those are .
now , i &apos;d like you to think about the following : actions are within your control , not entirely , but to a large extent .
today , i devote all of my time to working on this problem , and i &apos;ll go wherever the science takes me .
but i &apos;d like to relay to you a childhood experience of mine that really made me see the ocean differently , and it &apos;s become the foundation of my work because , i feel like , if in a day , i can see the ocean differently , then i can evoke that same kind of change in others , especially kids .
i mean , look , this animal is trying to fight back this spear from this soldier .
if we are going to stop the spread of hiv in our lifetime , then that is the change we need to spread .
thing is , in science , you basically have to tell the funding agencies what you &apos;re going to discover before they &apos;ll give you the money .
and the first number i thought of was ...
what do we mean to talk about a straight line on a curved surface ?
so , the gallery wanted me to have another show in two years , which meant that i really had to paint these paintings much faster than i had ever done them . and i — they started to become more political , and i picked areas that sort of were in the news or that i had some feeling about , and i began doing these things .
we placed it inside a box with magnetic sensors , and that allowed us to create this 3-dimensional point cloud and visualize the complex architecture of the silkworm cocoon .
when i was thinking to come here , what best title i wanted to say to my talk , i didn &apos;t find this .
it turns out that my father was an m.d. , actually studied hormones . i told him many times that i was tired , thirsty , not feeling very good .
i could see the blood pulsing in her neck .
and i realized that we had a frontier here , a very important one , that it was just a matter of changing the perspective , and the web could be actually used , already used , as a colossal and uncontrollable and highly anarchical tv channel , tv network , and anyone with very basic skills and very basic equipment , even someone like me who had this little stuttering issue , so if it happens , bear with me please , even someone like me could become a broadcaster .
we also see a big diy movement .
there are .
but what if we put more focus on quality ?
as you can see , there &apos;s a kind of odd , regular pattern in the data , twin peaks every year .
he said the key is he never took sugar with his tea .
&quot; &quot; female soldiers : become a part of history .
e = mc squared required an intuitive leap , and then you had to do the analysis afterwards .
i have to have trust in them and vice versa .
the revival of democratic politics will come from you , and i mean all of you .
you know , i love apple computers . i &apos;m obsessed .
we passed a bunch of rules to regulate the financial industry in response to the recent collapse .
anybody who dismisses the thought of a nuclear weapon being used by a terrorist is kidding themselves .
little miss sunshine was hot stuff , the kind of girl when you looked at her you forgot stuff , but for him , there was no forgetting her , the minute he saw her her image burned in his retina , she was out of this world , and she accepted him , something about this girl meant he knew whenever she was next to him , things weren ’ t as dark as they seemed , and he dared to dream , shadows were nowhere to be seen ; when she was there he beamed , his eyes would light up in ways that can ’ t be faked , when she grinned her rays erased the razor-tipped words of hate ,
those fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans .
( music ) ( video ) johnny cash : ♫ there ain &apos;t no grave ♫ ♫ can hold my body down ♫ ♫ there ain &apos;t no grave ♫ ♫ can hold body down ♫ ♫ when i hear the trumpet sound ♫ ♫ i &apos;m going to ride right out of the ground ♫ ♫ ain &apos;t no grave ♫ ♫ can hold my body ... ♫ ( applause ) ak : what better way to pay tribute to the man than to make something for one of his songs .
that &apos;s what makes the difference between political talking like this and really going for the important thing , a better life for people .
i said assigning a less than 20 percent probability would be a mistake in light of the current evidence we have .
and what &apos;s interesting is , by playing with these signals , we can completely control speed , heading and type of gait .
so , we can see far more detail in our galaxy than anyplace else .
and this gets me back to my research .
again , now we &apos;re past ted 1 , but just around the time of ted 2 , and what i &apos;d like to mention here is , even though you could imagine intelligence in the device , i look today at some of the work being done about the internet of things , and i think it &apos;s kind of tragically pathetic , because what has happened is people take the oven panel and put it on your cell phone , or the door key onto your cell phone , just taking it and bringing it to you , and in fact that &apos;s actually what you don &apos;t want .
( applause ) so in about seven years of doing nuclear research , i started out with a dream to make a &quot; &quot; star in a jar , &quot; &quot; a star in my garage , and i ended up meeting the president and developing things that i think can change the world , and i think other kids can too .
this was my first job .
and the state &apos;s key witness in ron &apos;s case was , in the end , the actual perpetrator .
that &apos;s a 2,000 mile journey .
well , hackers in the back row replied , &quot; then stop arresting us . &quot;
wk : i think we have discovered a very important issue in the arab world — that people care , people care about this great transformation .
even when the information is terrible , the visual can be quite beautiful .
a simpler way of thinking of it is that we have gone from a world of local control , then we went to a world of central control , and now we &apos;re in a world of people control .
in reality , the higgs field is just slightly on , not zero but 10,000 trillion times weaker than its fully on value , a bit like a light switch that &apos;s got stuck just before the off position .
prospera : i will plague them all , even to roaring .
in terms of where we are in science with dna identification capacities and so on , it &apos;s not that far off .
i &apos;ll show you a few examples of this now .
green means the student &apos;s already proficient .
so , i do want to say , at the outset , that i think compassion &apos;s great .
guess where those places are ?
so they may be looking at a light in the ceiling , or they may be isolated in the corner , or they might be engaged in these repetitive movements , in self-stimulatory movements that led them nowhere .
now notice , in a period which is dominated by a mono-polar world , you have fixed alliances — nato , the warsaw pact .
but unfortunately molas , even though they don &apos;t school , they still get caught in nets as by-catch .
woman : you wouldn &apos;t ? ( girl : no . ) woman : you &apos;d think that was fine .
a lot of people are worried about what is rationality about ?
ld : from india , we traveled to east africa , a region known for intolerance towards lgbt people .
eat it , and feel privileged .
it took a lot of convincing and discussions with these communities until they agreed that we are going to promote their language by making a booklet of their stories , fables and old tales in the tribe , and we would promote their music by making a cd of the songs from the tribe , and some drumbeating .
but , the fact is , in fact , that probably hollywood and mtv and mcdonalds have done more for american soft power around the world than any specifically government activity .
this here is an obituary headline .
their main goal here , like my teenagers , is to eat and grow .
children shouldn &apos;t memorize things from books , they should do activities , and that &apos;s a more effective way to learn .
so he tries to give the shepherd his armor , and the shepherd says , &quot; &quot; no . &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; i can &apos;t wear this stuff . &quot; &quot; the biblical verse is , &quot; &quot; i cannot wear this for i have not proved it , &quot; &quot; meaning , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve never worn armor before . you &apos;ve got to be crazy . &quot; &quot; so he reaches down instead on the ground and picks up five stones and puts them in his shepherd &apos;s bag and starts to walk down the mountainside to meet the giant .
so my wish for everyone is to be able to be their authentic self 24 / 7 , that would be the ultimate .
and what was also one of the bigger projects around that was moving 13 full-size cities up out of the reservoir , and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships .
so one of the problems with some of the studies that we &apos;ve done is that because they &apos;re all done using mechanical turk , these are not people &apos;s real passwords .
but if we give it a little bit more thought , like a paper clip .
for the past two years , 500 of these villages where these are have not needed any food aid — they &apos;re self-sufficient .
( applause ) and if you &apos;ve got a scientific problem like that , you can &apos;t solve it by holding a head count , and saying , &quot; &quot; more of us say yes than say no . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) apart from that , some of the heads count more than others .
i understood that i was wrong again .
but this technology still requires a conversation .
( laughter ) but we have no idea why it does that .
the uvc , the most energetic type , was occluded by the earth &apos;s atmosphere .
how poetic .
and the way i like to describe it is it &apos;s kind of like a math professor .
girls .
now we can take these responses and compare them to the responses in other listeners in the same brain area .
i mean , it must be true , because we &apos;ve had two hollywood blockbusters since that time , and this paradigm , from 1980 to about 2000 , totally changed how we geologists thought about catastrophes .
and the other , of course , is a birth control pill , which , in a very simple way , fundamentally changed the structure of society by changing the role of women in it by providing to them the opportunity to make reproductive choices .
it doesn &apos;t make quite as much money as body humor i &apos;m sure — ( laughter ) but nevertheless , what makes us treasure you and adore you .
for those of you who don &apos;t know , we &apos;re in the middle of the sixth mass extinction .
a hundred years ago , guess what ?
edicts like , &quot; &quot; defer judgment , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; go for quantity . &quot; &quot; and somehow that seems wrong .
and thanks to that , you really have an amazing machine to record all the bone motion in great detail .
now , at this point , a number of you are probably wondering well , what are you waiting for , to put on the market a game that would be good for the attention of my grandmother and that she would actually enjoy , or a game that would be great to rehabilitate the vision of my grandson who has amblyopia , for example ?
so you &apos;d be surprised to find that poem 1 was written by the very human poet gertrude stein .
i love this bird because it &apos;s a swamp bird , through and through , a swamp bird .
these are trials in a field of sorghum .
it &apos;s 1968 , and we &apos;re pretty much covering asia .
when you think of a cave , most of you think of a tunnel going through solid rock , and in fact , that &apos;s how most caves are .
we then put in the dbs electrodes and we wait for a month or a year , and the areas in red represent the areas where we increase glucose utilization .
i feel like our civilization works when this is a vast cultural heritage that we all share and that we know without having to outsource it to our devices , to our search engines and our smartphones .
of course they are , they are a mercantilist nation .
one out of every seven people .
depression , for example , is the third-leading cause of disability , alongside conditions such as diarrhea and pneumonia in children .
how much oil is stored in all of china ?
( laughter ) we are paid to be children , to basically go to the edge and discover what is out there .
thank you very much .
we &apos;d come in with some prototype underneath a black cloth and we &apos;d put it on the conference table , and we &apos;d pull off the black cloth and everybody would &quot; &quot; ooh &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ah . &quot; &quot; that was a really good time .
and the amoeba dubia doesn &apos;t look like much , except that each of you has about 3.2 billion letters , which is what makes you you , as far as gene code inside each of your cells , and this little amoeba which , you know , sits in water in hundreds and millions and billions , turns out to have 620 billion base pairs of gene code inside .
if you &apos;re playing against a very good opponent , they may distribute it in that green area , which is the prior distribution , making it hard for you to return .
these individuals have committed acts of unspeakable evil .
for all of these different critically important problems or critically important areas that we want to solve problems in , we basically know nothing at all .
but unfortunately , the ocean is opaque , and we can &apos;t see what &apos;s going on .
and i stood on that stage with dizzy gillespie on sound check on a wednesday afternoon , and i said , &quot; &quot; dizzy , why would you come to a black-run center in the middle of an industrial park with a high crime rate that doesn &apos;t even have a reputation in music ? &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; because i heard you built the center and i didn &apos;t believe that you did it , and i wanted to see for myself .
but a gene turns on and resorbs the tail , gets rid of it .
cynthia breazeal : so kismet interacted with people like kind of a non-verbal child or pre-verbal child , which i assume was fitting because it was really the first of its kind .
we make physical things , buildings that become a part in an accretional process ; they make cities .
i will split tanzania in five income groups , from the highest income to the lowest income , and here we go .
and that is the case in flies .
this stuff is getting serious enough that if we don &apos;t start paying attention to the deficit , we &apos;re going to end up losing the dollar .
and bingo . that is all you have to do .
they said , &quot; &quot; we look for employees who are great with our customers , who empower their teams , who negotiate effectively , who are able to manage conflict well , and are overall great communicators . &quot; &quot; which element of leadership does that equate to ?
the lesson from kurdistan and from palestine is that independence alone , without infrastructure , is futile .
&quot; it &apos;s a glamorous shade of pink . &quot;
now you are just looking at about 7.4 billion people with the map drawn in proportion to those people .
what they would do is they would explain what was going on and then dictate information that the professor would transcribe onto the many motorized blackboards in the front of the class , and then we &apos;d have a discussion .
probably not , but people like me do .
those deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence .
it &apos;s going to depend if they &apos;re wealthy or impoverished .
so i talked — i had to come up with a plan to figure these things out .
imagine if i had to feel even a hundred other people &apos;s suffering .
there were people at my table who thought it was , you know , fantastic .
there you are in my ear .
it &apos;s a special feeling .
and so we need a theory that unifies the very large and the very small , which we don &apos;t yet have .
the audience is led to make assumptions or elaborations that are perfectly reasonable , but do not , in fact , match what is being done in front of them .
they had deployed all the right incentives , they paid professionals to write and edit thousands of articles .
was it about me as a child refugee , or as a woman who set up a high-tech software company back in the 1960s , one that went public and eventually employed over 8,500 people ?
this is an example of bio-mimicry , which is something we &apos;re really starting to look a lot more for .
what we need is another hero generation . those of us who are alive in the united states of america today especially , but also the rest of the world , have to somehow understand that history has presented us with a choice — just as jill &#91; bolte &#93; taylor was figuring out how to save her life while she was distracted by the amazing experience that she was going through .
and those were then distributed to djs who have made hundreds of songs using that source material .
we knew there &apos;s a mechanism called homologous recombination that biology uses to repair dna that can put pieces together .
it &apos;s just like the one cervantes wrote about in &quot; &quot; don quixote , &quot; &quot; which by the way is the root of the word &quot; &quot; quixotry , &quot; &quot; the highest-scoring scrabble word of all time , 365 points .
did life start here and was it transported there ?
so , you know , the thing is to remember that because otherwise , 10 years from now , we &apos;ll be back here trying to tell this story again .
so they inhaled it , but they are not aware of it .
so my coauthors and i have used computers , the greatest tool of our time , to assist people &apos;s imagination and help them imagine what it might be like to go into the future .
i went to poker nights .
yes , they do a whole bunch of other stuff , but they &apos;re very good at this .
he &apos;s also interested in the transformation of the arm , the hand , to the wing .
so i decided to slice these up with the tool that i make by — i sharpen the end of a needle into a blade .
where were you ?
and there &apos;s this great novel that arthur clarke wrote twice , called &quot; &quot; against the fall of night &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; the city and the stars . &quot; &quot; they &apos;re both wonderful and largely the same , except that computers happened in between .
at this point , something else happened .
now , take a look at the ancient ancestor of banana .
it &apos;s true what they say , and i didn &apos;t believe it until it happened to me .
rome is a city full of surprises .
a lot of the kobe beef that you see in the u.s. is not the real thing .
and i believe , personally , that we &apos;re on the verge and that , with the presence and help of people like you here , we can bring about the prophecy of isaiah .
and these clouds , these rarer clouds , remind us that the exotic can be found in the everyday .
and it &apos;s driven and propelled forward by new leaders , like many of the people here , by new tools , like the ones we &apos;ve seen here , and by new pressures .
they can &apos;t do it naturally , so what they do with this thing is they take a spoon , take some cells out of an adult gaur &apos;s mouth , code , take the cells from that and insert it into a fertilized cow &apos;s egg , reprogram cow &apos;s egg — different gene code .
this is actually a desktop inkjet printer , but instead of using ink , we &apos;re using cells .
my footprint &apos;s smaller , i &apos;m lessening pollution , i feel better about the animals , i &apos;m even saving money .
today we have 20 million refugees in the world .
and that , if there &apos;s no more rain , there &apos;ll be nothing to drink , or to eat ? &quot; &quot; i heard that , and my eyes welled up and i went , &quot; &quot; oh , my !
i had other options , but i didn &apos;t choose them .
in reward terms , it &apos;s not money ; it &apos;s not being given cash — that &apos;s nice — it &apos;s doing stuff with our peers , watching us , collaborating with us .
when we think about accidents , we usually consider them to be harmful , unfortunate or even dangerous , and they certainly can be .
so what do i say ?
but then , of course , the body has many parts , and things grow at different rates , and they have different sizes and different people ; however , not so with the interior .
in fact , so woeful was our telephone service that a member of parliament stood up in 1984 and complained about this .
and the result , as so often in science , was boring : fifty percent of their food was medicinal . fifty percent was not .
and president medvedev of russia , for example , pronounced in 2008 this was the beginning of the end of united states power .
even more importantly , this common culture enables international peacebuilders to ignore the micro-level tensions that often jeopardize the macro-level settlements .
thank you .
for example , i &apos;m currently examining correlations between the frequency of a patient &apos;s nightly wandering and his or her daily activities and diet .
we can understand functionality . this is really important .
while it may appear to be a completely chaotic place , when you see it from above , there seems to be a whole grid of waterways and canals connecting each and every home .
so , people of the ted community , i put it to you that what the world needs now is nuclear energy .
every dot is a person . we make the dot size proportional to people &apos;s body size ; so bigger dots are bigger people .
metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia , in which we understand one concept in the context of another .
so gneezy and rustichini run this experiment for a dozen weeks — run the fine for a dozen weeks — and then they say , &quot; &quot; okay , that &apos;s it . all done ; fine . &quot; &quot; and then a really interesting thing happens : nothing changes .
( laughter ) what a handsome cat .
nt : another student in the first year of aims was shehu .
the evidence from genetic data is that the human population around this time , roughly 70,000 years ago , crashed to fewer than 2,000 individuals .
what can you do to a symmetrical object , move it in some way , so it looks the same as before you moved it ?
so we &apos;re looking for a balance , a focused relaxation where we can allow thoughts to come and go without all the usual involvement .
and in the process , what that allows us to do is to redirect a lot more of our growth back into existing communities that could use a boost , and have the infrastructure in place , instead of continuing to tear down trees and to tear up the green space out at the edges .
the idea is , let &apos;s have some sensors that listen to these storms , this electrical firing , and see if you can , in the same time that it takes for this storm to leave the brain and reach the legs or the arms of an animal — about half a second — let &apos;s see if we can read these signals , extract the motor messages that are embedded in it , translate it into digital commands and send it to an artificial device that will reproduce the voluntary motor wheel of that brain in real time .
and another 50 percent of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous .
these effects were all unanticipated , and yet we &apos;re discovering they &apos;re predictable .
and yet , mcdonald &apos;s sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year .
she got pregnant , ran to the bush to have the baby , but you know , her body was very immature , and she ended up having obstructed labor .
and so there are a number of atavisms that can happen .
and finally , you could rightly ask , why care about this ?
man 5 : failed writer-alcoholic brand .
so this graph here , i &apos;m going to show you now .
and a few meters ahead of us , there was a place where a tree had fallen out of the bank , and its branches were touching the water , and it was shadowy .
we have perception , computation and non-visual interfaces .
man : i &apos;m sorry .
we &apos;ve also talked about concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
( laughter ) here is the green one .
but through luck and an awful lot of perseverance , i was able to get computer time around the city .
now you may say , &quot; okay , so we &apos;re eating 500 grams just by accident . &quot;
and then i came across a team at harvard university that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it , instead of in brain research , towards diagnosing brain disorders in children .
and a book , if you had a book , is about a megabyte , so — you know , if you had it in microsoft word .
there &apos;s nothing like the feeling which invades you when after months of hard thinking , you finally understand the right reasoning to solve your problem .
a recent study looking at penalty shootouts in football shows that players who represent countries with a very bad record in penalty shootouts , like , for example , england , tend to be quicker to take their shots than countries with a better record , and presumably as a result , they &apos;re more likely to miss .
secondly , the majority of that growth comes from white migrants .
the machine made this decision for us .
her system can predict the likelihood of depression months before the onset of any symptoms — months before .
they &apos;re the school &apos;s biggest risk and also its best bet .
i grew up in an enormously traditional family .
if you were to just completely ignore human ethics for a second and slice up my brain right now , you would see that there was an amazing number of brain regions that were active while recalling that memory .
and it &apos;s kind of brilliant .
and there was a building , a new building , going up , that was being built right outside , across the street from our hotel .
( applause ) i told you in the beginning that it was necessary for us to plant about 2.5 million trees of about 200 different species in order to rebuild the ecosystem .
so , mr. gore , thank you .
it was a fairy tale , and then we retired .
and you all know roughly the story .
they may be a reaction to bigger trends .
i did a little bit of research on this notion , and it might calm some folk down to know that the idea of a net guaranteed minimum income has been championed by those frothing-at-the-mouth socialists friedrich hayek , richard nixon and milton friedman .
first problem is just , well , where should we start ?
well , now we &apos;re going to the bahamas to meet a remarkable group of dolphins that i &apos;ve been working with in the wild for the last 28 years .
that &apos;s why , a few years later , i joined with a group of college friends in bringing the make poverty history campaign to australia .
it &apos;s also interesting to think about what other things are — so if these all enabled great values , why should we think that evolution has happened to provide us with all the modalities we would need to engage with other values that there might be ?
being close to the content — that &apos;s the content really is close to my heart .
and what has happened ?
and if we were able to arrange spaces where we could come across works where we would be told , use these works of art to cement these ideas in your mind , we would get a lot more out of art .
if we don &apos;t supply vitamins to the prisoners , it &apos;s a war crime . &quot; &quot; and the next morning , supplies of vitamin b12 are delivered to the camp , and the prisoners begin to recover .
( laughter ) we can &apos;t sit idly by here either .
&quot; &quot; should we be there ?
they &apos;re discoveries of people and the way people are , and new leadership .
of course these microbial fuel cells , they contain microbes .
and i said , well , by whom ? i mean most , you know — there ’ s three attitudes : you ’ re right , and i don ’ t know why , which is the most rational one at this point .
when iran &apos;s ideological impulses collided with its strategic interests , the strategic interests always prevailed .
and once again , i &apos;d like to look back to prehistory to say something about it .
and in closing , when you have a moment of peace or quiet in these very busy few days or perhaps afterwards , spare a thought for that person you thought about who has a mental illness , or persons that you thought about who have mental illness , and dare to care for them . thank you . ( applause ) ( applause )
so when ruslan came the day after , before he put the first question to me , i asked him , &quot; &quot; how is your son today ? is he feeling better ? &quot; &quot; ruslan was taken by surprise .
now how men feel about women &apos;s rights matters to the future of this region .
i don &apos;t want to go back , and it &apos;s not because i &apos;m adventurous .
and this hotel suite is 4,300 square feet .
we offer a two-year diploma to talented students who have successfully completed their high school education .
but what you realize , it &apos;s got an achilles &apos; heel .
so since we started this work a little over eight years ago , 17,000 guerrillas have demobilized .
unless — &quot; &quot; unless , &quot; &quot; that most evocative of all english words — &quot; unless . &quot;
so when i go back without the prime , your brain already has the model so you can see it again .
so they concluded that because they saw activation in the insula , this meant the subjects loved their iphones .
you accumulate knowledge throughout your life in memories .
nothing in the box .
anyway , i was looking through this book , wondering if i was much crazier than i thought i was , or maybe it &apos;s not a good idea to diagnose yourself with a mental disorder if you &apos;re not a trained professional , or maybe the psychiatry profession has a kind of strange desire to label what &apos;s essentially normal human behavior as a mental disorder .
and only a few people can do it .
and , by the end , you &apos;re going to see clusters of obese and non-obese individuals within the network .

here &apos;s what our trawl samples from the plastic soup our ocean has become look like .
and this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing : understanding who &apos;s the audience .
and it never fails to engage .
but at least i am hopeful that we should be able to fight this war with better medical imaging techniques in the way that is not blind .
yet for the last year , it has been ebola that has stolen all of the headlines and the fear .
the most kind of crude way in which we have it , are things like horoscopes .
( laughter ) but my neighbor only knows two types of countries — industrialized and developing .
this is what your music looks like , but here &apos;s its visual abstraction .
but what &apos;s interesting to me is that this was the first case of a mechanical device suffering , at least indirectly , from a human disease .
and that &apos;s their problem ; we &apos;re eating them to death .
this is in the courtyard of a twelfth-century alchemist .
second , we need to create the space for what i call &quot; &quot; managed dissent . &quot; &quot; if we are to shift paradigms , if we are to make breakthroughs , if we are to destroy myths , we need to create an environment in which expert ideas are battling it out , in which we &apos;re bringing in new , diverse , discordant , heretical views into the discussion , fearlessly , in the knowledge that progress comes about , not only from the creation of ideas , but also from their destruction — and also from the knowledge that , by surrounding ourselves by divergent , discordant , heretical views .
so this evolutionary foil safeguards the plant against these rather cute animals , and protects it and of course ensures its survival .
we need to connect the information always with the action , and then that action feeds back into different information , and it creates , of course , a feedback loop .
here &apos;s quick history sidebar for you : no woman ever burnt her bra in the &apos; 60s .
and it ’ s not a diet .
that satellite tag will now have your shark phone home and send in a message .
( applause ) so that &apos;s what it is all about .
but that was no end .
if you &apos;re a mammal , the most dangerous time in life is the first few hours after birth .
jim went three miles went down , and i went about three miles away from the studio and photographed this in a garage .
now , there was one small catch .
we got a bunch of naive subjects in , we didn &apos;t tell them anything about the robot , sat them down in front of the robot and said , talk to the robot .
but she told me , &quot; &quot; mom , it &apos;s not american . &quot; &quot; she said she is in love — in love with a nice chinese girl .
thank you .
if you want to become a fossil , you actually need to die somewhere where your bones will be rapidly buried .
and yet , somehow you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life .
and what &apos;s under that is what we call bureaucracy .
there is over 500 separate components .
this is a tunnel that &apos;s abandoned in hell &apos;s kitchen .
i was in a land of plenty .
as you go into another community , there are bound to be changes .
this is the first house i built .
they help with digging and work crew organization .
halfway through this process , i met the president of kiribati , president anote tong .
for me , the issue about aid — i don &apos;t think that africans need to now go all the way over to the other side and feel bad about aid .
we have fought to be here .
the headline says , &quot; &quot; nsa broke privacy rules thousands of times per year . &quot; &quot; tell us about that .
the book designer &apos;s responsibility is threefold : to the reader , to the publisher and , most of all , to the author .
many of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad .
( applause ) where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm &apos;s length from politics ?
it turned out to be incredibly successful .
( laughter ) dp : hi , could i have 400 with a schmear ?
if you &apos;re in the military and you &apos;re in a lot of combat , you &apos;re no more likely to kill yourself than if you weren &apos;t .
it &apos;s not like the teddy bear .
we &apos;re essentially against lying .
you know , skiers pray for snow ?
and yet , just like salman , they were lifelong , tenacious self-learners , and our home was stacked with thousands of books , records and artwork .
if necessary you can put babies in your ads .
i went to yale for graduate school , studied in a building of this style by le corbusier , affectionately known in our business as brutalism .
and this is called , &quot; &quot; swallowing the bitterness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i used to believe america was the best .
we &apos;ve also gone on with what was initially our primary population of people with above-the-elbow amputations .
and the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information to move ahead to protect some of these significant hope spots , hotspots .
you and i weave together entire stories of people , places and things the moment we lay our gaze on them .
this is an image that won us a competition for an exhibition pavilion for the swiss expo 2002 on lake neuchatel , near geneva .
if you go into the military , you &apos;ll find lots of carl nordens as well .
and that &apos;s when it dawned on me : this kid had only ever experienced disabled people as objects of inspiration .
and we thought a solar-powered plane wouldn &apos;t really make sense , but you could do it and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power and maybe help that field .
it &apos;s like the water of the stream ; it never sits still .
ca : how about you , melinda , though ? can you ? ( laughter ) you never know .
so there &apos;s no point in looking . &quot; &quot; and that , of course , that set back the progress of radio astronomy by about 20 years .
fundamentally , these technologies exist today .
they did it by focusing on the things that matter to their business , like wasting less energy and water in their manufacturing processes ; like making sure the ceo contracts had the ceos incentivized for the long-term results of the company and the communities they served , not just quarterly results ; or building a first class culture that would have higher employee loyalty , retention and productivity .
now the other issue comes with , not just the ability to tell pitches apart , but the ability to tell sounds apart .
a lot of these people are highly educated and skilled workers .
and politically , it was awful .
we can digitize the collect pond and the streams , and see where they actually are in the geography of the city today .
the redefined physician is human , knows she &apos;s human , accepts it , isn &apos;t proud of making mistakes , but strives to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else .
i must say that before i went to the u.s. , i didn &apos;t consciously identify as african .
so that &apos;s what &apos;s exciting to me , seeing how data can change my perspective and change my mind midstream — beautiful , lovely data .
so this presumably means that these denisovans had been more widespread in the past , since we don &apos;t think that the ancestors of melanesians were ever in siberia .
now , when i was a young man — 40 years ago , the country was very , very poor with lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty .
that &apos;s one actor , the security council .
but there is another point .
and so we , in the mixing process , have to develop the gluten , we have to activate the leaven or the yeast , and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly .
now there is one issue that is hyper-partisan , and where there is one party that is just spend , spend , spend , we don &apos;t care , spend some more , and that of course is republicans when it comes to military defense spending .
well , this is the question the edge foundation asked this year , and four of the respondents said , &quot; &quot; seti . &quot; &quot; why ?
now then , you guys have — you have a minute comeback on him to pick up a point he said , challenge it , whatever .
you remember that i told you , when i received the farm from my parents that was my paradise , that was the farm .
embalming is a cheat code , providing the illusion that death and then decay are not the natural end for all organic life on this planet .
so it really , really helps the criminal investigation to establish the cause of death , and in some cases also directing the investigation in the right direction to find out who the killer really was .
and it felt kind of like being president , actually .
there &apos;s such a disconnect .
well , president john f. kennedy said something about this that is just spot on : &quot; &quot; there are risks and costs to a program of action , but they are far less than the long-range risks and costs of comfortable inaction . &quot; &quot; i can appreciate that there is estimation risk in this , but since this is based on widespread scientific consensus , the odds that it &apos;s not completely wrong are better than the odds that our house will burn down or we &apos;ll get in a car accident .
they acted sweet .
the machines we build continue to suffer from mechanical failures .
and furthermore , he released mr. carrillo so that he could aid in the preparation of his own defense if the prosecution decided to retry him .
bg : okay , so we &apos;ll let you go and save it , and rescue it .
so it may be that , in certain halls , this dynamic may well work . ( music ) it may be that in other halls , they &apos;re simply not going to experience that at all and so therefore , my level of soft , gentle playing may have to be ... ( music ) do you see what i mean ? so , because of this explosion in access to sound , especially through the deaf community , this has not only affected how music institutions , how schools for the deaf treat sound — and not just as a means of therapy — although of course , being a participator of music , that definitely is the case as well .
and right in the middle of a negotiation i &apos;d be able to get the answer .
( laughter ) i love data .
right ? it &apos;s pretty big .
they &apos;ve been shaped by two powerful evolutionary forces : natural selection , the struggle for survival , and sexual selection , the struggle for reproductive opportunity .
it &apos;s easy to simply ignore them and it &apos;s even easier when the government goes to great lengths to keep them hidden .
and that bicycle cable can open or close a hand or a hook or bend an elbow .
however , the implications of those results — of a possible environment within this moon that could support prebiotic chemistry , and perhaps life itself — were so exciting that , in the intervening two years , we have focused more on enceladus .
now , often people ask me , &quot; what did you learn by studying choice ? &quot;
again in 2009 , we see a paper that says that trocars account for over half of all major complications in laparoscopic surgery .
we need to bring health and food and education and respect for all god &apos;s citizens , all god &apos;s children , remembering mama eternal .
so , you have a near-permanent solution for reinvasion of termites .
ce : and all of a sudden , everybody &apos;s reawoken .
( laughter ) now , you see the magnet fell really slowly .
security has meant everything else .
no sophistication , no class , no dignity , no history .
so , i &apos;m going to begin by applying this idea to diarrheal diseases .
so how can we tell the difference between the fears worth listening to and all the others ?
what she learned at that mosque prevented her from going to join isis .
and you have the market revolution of the 1980s and the huge increase of inequality in societies .
you can view yourselves from the outside .
and i didn &apos;t understand . he said , &quot; &quot; you have a great style .
and all of this had been hidden to me , before i had tried to understand it .
and when i asked one of the women about the shock and awe response , she said , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t worry , same thing back home .
we have these maquettes scanned into the computer at very high resolution — enormous polygonal count .
and that &apos;s actually a completely computer-generated rendering of her face .
but how are we going to know who they are when we &apos;ve been told to avoid and be afraid of them ?
we went to brazil . we went to china and to india , to bentonville , arkansas , to washington , d.c. and to sacramento .
it &apos;s a very old literature by now , it &apos;s coming up on 50 years .
let &apos;s look at a specific video so you can see how it works .
this is why wars get fought .
okay , i &apos;m going to show you again something about our diets .
it reminds us that we are a part of nature and we need to take care of it .
this lets you do it .
similarly , just through the grip of the cane , you can feel contrasting textures in the floor below , and over time you build a pattern of where you are and where you &apos;re headed .
but here he stands as testament to the fact that you can &apos;t roughhouse on the playground today .
your skin cell is really useless without a heart cell , muscle cell , a brain cell and so on .
people are saying that it &apos;s moving from the idea of the dream home to the dream neighborhood .
its origins are firmly rooted in the analog age .
to love everybody , he sometimes did not see the very closest ones , and that is inevitable for men of his stature .
a vegetable , having the intelligence of a three-month-old baby .
and i just want to give you the highlights of the bystander approach , because it &apos;s a big thematic shift , although there &apos;s lots of particulars , but the heart of it is , instead of seeing men as perpetrators and women as victims , or women as perpetrators , men as victims , or any combination in there .
this is a shift change , one of three .
they said , &quot; &quot; go and do it , and we &apos;ll come and lecture . &quot; &quot; and i knew it would be amazing fun to bring brilliant students from these countries — where they don &apos;t have any opportunities — together with the best lecturers in the world — who i knew would come , because of the interest in africa — and put them together and just let the sparks fly .
and it &apos;s not just linux , it &apos;s this thing called git , which is this management system for software development .
so what , though , is driving that change ?
the eulogy virtues are the ones that get mentioned in the eulogy , which are deeper : who are you , in your depth , what is the nature of your relationships , are you bold , loving , dependable , consistency ?
i think anybody who lives in an urban environment encounters graffiti all the time , and there &apos;s all different sorts of it .
at the 15-hour mark , i started to get a better picture of what was there , but i had a creeping suspicion that what i was looking at was not at all related to what i was looking for .
( music and singing &quot; &quot; indey &quot; &quot; ) ( music ends ) or take , for example , the phrase for &quot; &quot; it is right &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; it is correct &quot; &quot; — &quot; lickih nehu ... lickih nehu . &quot;
so , one person could actually play and almost — this is pretty heavy — carry the hurdy-gurdy .
these are huckleberry bushes .
if you get a red cross , well , i &apos;ve looked carefully around the room and it &apos;s not going to make much difference to this crew .
so the question is , how do they deal with this material ?
and at the same time , the gorgeous work of takeshi ishiguro , who did these beautiful salt-and-pepper containers that are made of rice dough .
and the interaction is crucial .
ghana felt safe to me as a child .
for us , the sun is the source of prosperity .
so i was excited , then i panicked , then i was excited , then i panicked , and in between the excitement and the panicking , i started to do my research , and my research primarily consisted of googling how to give a great ted talk .
this an unprocessed picture , by the way , i should say , it &apos;s black and white , straight from saturnian orbit .
and they &apos;ve put it deep down in an iron mine in minnesota , ok , deep under the ground , and in fact , in the last couple of days announced the most sensitive results so far .
he wanted to know what is just .
so that , i will not do .
they are so many and so varied that from this distance they appear like the stars from earth .
this change has contributed to the vitality and the whole economy .
and they featured role models like abraham lincoln , who was praised for being modest and unassuming .
it was done in five months by a startup company of a couple of people .
so we were careful .
in countries where this really went forward — do you remember the english label , of the &quot; &quot; plain english campaign &quot; &quot; ? — this is all based on a consumers &apos; movement .
and that &apos;s why i believe that netflix was so successful , because they used data and brains where they belong in the process .
and as a little girl , i loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us much more like a helpful , trusted sidekick — something that would delight us , enrich our lives and help us save a galaxy or two .
so we started to realize that we had a problem , and the problem is more serious because of this .
in fact , when they put it into the jawbone , it could integrate into the jaw , and we know now with very sophisticated imaging technologies that part of that integration comes from the fact that this material is designed in a very specific way , has a beautiful chemistry , has a beautiful architecture .
things where , you know , a factor of 10 difference can make a factor of 1,000 difference in the outcome .
i was so moved by these results that i wanted to make these forests with the same acumen with which we make cars or write software or do any mainstream business , so i founded a company which is an end-to-end service provider to create these native natural forests .
if you look at the human brain compared to a chimpanzee brain , what you see is we have basically a very big chimpanzee brain .
so this is a huge challenge to the way we think creativity comes about .
but that &apos;s how robust this moral reframing effect was .
and the craft that i ’ m in — this hasn ’ t been shown before .
next , we must disseminate what we learn .
so for me , this project shows kind of how far we can go from some of those sort of small things that i was working on at the beginning of my career .
it &apos;s the era of big business and data centers for computing .
so one of the disadvantages of these small robots is its size .
and you can see the massively parallel processing nintendos there .
today in mexico we &apos;re asking for gandhis .
the way we show the world is going to change the way we see this world , and we live in a moment where the mass media are doing a terrible , terrible job at representing the world : violence , extremists , only spectacular events , only simplifications of everyday life .
i mean , this is a 2005 business week cover .
that &apos;s why i have one last thing i want to show you .
but i want you to do is also , with your eyes , is follow the colored ball that i ask you to follow .
so , what i &apos;d like to do today is tell you a little bit about myself , because i &apos;d like to put in context what i &apos;m going to tell you .
so i try to create these very minimal activities that allow people to express themselves , and , hopefully — ( &quot; &quot; the end &quot; &quot; by the doors ) whoa ! i &apos;m like — on the page , but it doesn &apos;t exist .
it wasn &apos;t two years ago that everybody was talking about — we &apos;ve found the holy grail of biology .
( applause ) now , this doesn &apos;t mean that the job is done , obviously .
i &apos;d want him to be unselfish , and look for the pass first and not shoot all the time .
so these numbers are the numbers which denote the roughness of these surfaces .
for example , if i do that , and reach and grab an apple , a motor command neuron in the front of my brain will fire .
the fact is that it does not scale .
aren &apos;t they ?
( laughter ) at least , according to a 1973 &quot; &quot; book of lists &quot; &quot; survey which preceded all those online best , worst , funniest lists that you see today .
so i guess that &apos;s my brand .
they are open-minded in the face of ambiguity .
we made giant pillow-shaped balloons .
yes , we do have all the resources that we need in order to develop new cultural institutions , but what i think is more important is that we are very fortunate to have visionary leaders who understand that this can &apos;t happen from outside , it has to come from within .
wherever we deliver our services , farmers use these tools to climb out of poverty .
stories make us fall in love .
off the coast of california comes this : it &apos;s an abalone shell .
so i started a project called life edited at lifeedited.org to further this conversation and to find some great solutions in this area .
usually , doxorubicin — let &apos;s call it &quot; &quot; dox &quot; &quot; — is the cancer drug that is the first line of treatment for breast cancer .
and they then become the comets as we see them in the sky .
and why , the root question , is so little being done to stop the wars , the persecution and the poverty that is driving so many people to the shores of europe ?
look for that kind of stuff .
the male of this species has a massive brain that he uses to hunt for cold beer .
this is my son leo .
you place the cross into the ice , in the shadow of ausangate , the most sacred of all apus , or sacred mountains of the inca .
look , the highly infected are four percent of all population and they hold 50 percent of the hiv-infected .
inequality is the other great challenge to achieving sustainable urbanization .
one is , you said weaken encryption . i didn &apos;t .
and then they turned on us .
( laughter ) ls : i don &apos;t even have to talk , right ?
which is not just to meet new people and extend your reach , extend your influence , but instead , find someone you don &apos;t know , and find someone else you don &apos;t know , and introduce them .
what happens is that the second this introduction of incentive gets us so that instead of asking , &quot; &quot; what is my responsibility ? &quot; &quot; all we ask is , &quot; &quot; what serves my interests ? &quot; &quot; when incentives don &apos;t work , when ceos ignore the long-term health of their companies in pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to massive bonuses , the response is always the same .
and this is not an unlikely scenario because 90 percent of sexual assaults are committed by repeat offenders .
( laughter ) ( applause ) so this has actually been a little bit startling to the game-development community . ( laughter )
what troubles me is not that video game violence is becoming more and more like real life violence , but that real life violence is starting to look more and more like a video game .
that was in minutes — 20 minutes .
( video ) woman : &quot; &quot; i destroy lives , &quot; &quot; mum said .
a switch-hitter is a bisexual person , and we gay and lesbian folks play for the other team .
so i studied forestry .
and , as a psychologist , what excited me most was the idea that we would use what we learned in the virtual world about ourselves , about our identity , to live better lives in the real world .
the quality of care that children receive in their families can have a more significant effect on their well-being than from the actual experiences of war that they have been exposed to .
and so there &apos;s about seven or eight cities already in the u.s.
you know what his unsuccessful pickup line was ?
take a look at these guys , they &apos;re growing in power , and by the way , this was done a while ago before the current economic crisis , and that &apos;s probably going to get steeper .
as this information started coming to people , we said things like , we don &apos;t want to see your expense report , we don &apos;t want to know how many holidays you &apos;re taking , we don &apos;t want to know where you work .
and again , the transition from one of the many thousands of sketches and computer images to the reality .
because i was saving a minute out of my commute .
and i have a good example of that too , again from the history of science .
and so the global village is as big as a planet , and as small as a village post office .
thank you .
today , there are 14 health clinics in that area alone .
how does it really work ? it turns out there is a back room that is kind of windowless , metaphorically speaking .
now for this , i needed a different craft : bigger , wider , faster , more powerful .
it &apos;s a very desolate place .
you &apos;ll noticed that almost all of them are minority .
that i &apos;m this uber-endurance guy ?
and those bumps act like a magnet for water .
and the children , we teach during six months how to separate their garbage .
so , it &apos;s sort of related , but you can see it &apos;s much more overtly erotic .
to the extent that you can equalize the amount of detail that people put into the mental representations of near and far future , people begin to make decisions about the two in the same way .
the contemporaries of william beveridge , who was the architect of the first welfare state and the author of the beveridge report , had little faith in what they called the average sensual or emotional man .
we could do with much , much less — and i know , i &apos;ve been a vegetarian for a long time , and you can easily do without anything .
and everybody is talking to everyone else — it &apos;s not isolated points on a map anymore , it &apos;s a network we &apos;ve created .
so penguins really differ in their personalities just like our dogs and our cats .
and it &apos;s a remarkable map . it &apos;s in the national archives here in kew .
this is the difference between being effective — doing the right things — and being efficient — doing things well whether or not they &apos;re important .
the universe disappears .
so last summer , i attended a wedding in southern england .
think about war .
he was exhausted , and rob was staying with him .
developing world is a short life in a large family . &quot; &quot; and i like that definition , because it enabled me to transfer their mindset into the dataset .
who doesn &apos;t want healthier children ?
now , let me give you an example of how it works .
i &apos;m not sure what it &apos;s called .
the cyber world became accessible , and this technology that we created for the blind has many uses , way beyond what i imagined .
well , how about science ?
i hated that walk , i hated that balcony , i hated that room , and i hated that house .
there &apos;s 9,000 of them here , and they &apos;re being built for most of the big cities , beijing and shanghai , shenzhen .
there &apos;s been four billion years of organic , biological life .
and animals are thriving — and we probably came from here .
ue : nope . it &apos;s just smoke .
and the low-power double bind means that we have a narrow range , and we lack power .
so there was a time when it was your first time ever hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work .
and so this would be the typical talk i would give .
although they are like in different contexts , one is magical , the other two are like investigation , i like those books because they have something special in them .
and if we were to fall towards this black hole , we would see all of that light lensed around it , and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened .
here are some tricks that i started to bring to that new terrain .
so let &apos;s look at how often the technology has to do the right thing .
here , in a photo by brian , a seemingly crucified shark is caught up in a gill net off of baja .
one year turned to two , two turned to three .
and nobody calls batman simple or stupid or skinny .
and they work .
and you believe that you can self-improve and educate yourself as you go along .
now , these caves contain some of the oldest cave paintings in the world .
i can hear if someone points at me with a remote control .
these young boys are in nepal .
now , imagine , if you will , without getting too technical , i &apos;m making a little sine wave here in the air .
now this encrypted data is sent through the server to alice , and because the message was encrypted using alice &apos;s public key , the only key that can now decrypt it is a private key that belongs to alice , and it turns out alice is the only person that actually has this key .
new drugs kept them healthy .
he hasn &apos;t rsvp &apos;d yet , but fingers crossed .
and what you have to think about is , when you &apos;re dancing in the flames , what &apos;s next ?
ez : well , if you are sure , i have to tell you that within five minutes i will talk very fast .
and of course , we used the loop of the building as a circulatory system , to thread everything together and to allow both visitors and staff to experience all these different functions in a great unity .
in fact , i scoured the headlines looking for the best headline in a newspaper i could .
powering them is one of the greater engineering challenges that we had to deal with , because powering a cell phone under a tree canopy , any sort of solar power under a tree canopy , was an as-yet-unsolved problem , and that &apos;s this unique solar panel design that you see here , which in fact is built also from recycled byproducts of an industrial process .
less than five percent .
i remembered being in that hut with that old lady and my mom holding me down .
the first one belongs to those ethnic societies who believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous , so they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with any centralized authority .
it &apos;s moving us towards an inflection point for gender equality .
what i &apos;m going to try and do is to give some pointers to what i think is the landscape on the other side of the crisis , what things we should be looking out for and how we can actually use the crisis .
gray-yellow hair , army pants under a nightgown , her turning away , hiding her ravaged face in her hands , muttering an inappropriate &quot; &quot; hi . &quot; &quot; sometimes there are frightening goings-on in the stairwell .
well we know that that was not a cheap war .
comets are very much like asteroids .
thank you .
you go to an elementary school at three in the afternoon and you watch the kids come out , and they &apos;re wearing these 80-pound backpacks .
and yet , i am growing nostalgic about my country of birth .
i loved this guy .
♫ we don &apos;t need no more trouble ♫ get that idiot out !
it will make a difference if you were to discover that the person you &apos;re looking at with lust is actually a disguised version of your son or daughter , your mother or father .
switch out the knob for a pulse module , which is here , and now you &apos;ve made a little blinker .
but this is one of those very rare moments when we have to choose whether we &apos;re just pedaling furiously to get back to where we were a year or two ago , and a very narrow idea of what the economy is for , or whether this is a moment to jump ahead , to reboot and to do some of the things we probably should have been doing anyway .
which leads to the last topic : do not forget to have fun .
you can sort of see the funky new condo buildings in between the office buildings and the public space and the new main street .
we also tag makos with our noaa colleagues , blue sharks .
so it &apos;s about a mile across , 600 feet deep .
( laughter ) who folded that thing up there , and why ? ( laughter )
and if you look , you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s only one way you can score three .
they said , &quot; &quot; why are you doing this , lincoln ? &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; look , these are the strongest and most able men in the country .
and so we decided , of course , to have sim city 2000 , not the other sim city , that one in particular , so the criteria that we developed along the way were really strong , and were not only criteria of selection .
and finally , a criminal justice system that believes in black young people , rather than treating black young people as the enemy to be rounded up . ( applause )
nothing could be further from the truth , and i hope today to show you why that is .
we do this , of course , with matters of race , and politics , and everything else , and we do it in science as well . so we look , just look — and scientists do it , constantly — we look for evidence that reinforces our models , and some folks are just all too able and willing to provide the evidence that reinforces the models .
for the past five years , i &apos;ve been taking my wife and kids to southwestern montana , where i worked as a teenager on the hay harvest . and montana , at first sight , seems like the most pristine environment in the united states .
now how about exponentially cheaper ?
and aicha started , and she said , &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t know if my son is guilty or innocent , but i want to tell you how sorry i am for what happened to your families .
but i think this research shows that the british enlightenment , or the scottish enlightenment , with david hume , adam smith , actually had a better handle on who we are — that reason is often weak , our sentiments are strong , and our sentiments are often trustworthy .
this is bp &apos;s gas station in downtown los angeles .
how many creationists do we have in the room ?
they mobilize the resources to create a solution , both within the clinical system , and then by bringing in people from public health , from other sectors , lawyers , whoever is willing to play ball , let &apos;s bring in to create a solution that makes sense , to take those patients who actually have clinical problems and address their root causes together by linking them to the resources you need .
remarkable impact on mortality .
you will have your fair share of insults and ridicule and threats .
the green areas here show where corn yields , just showing corn as an example , are already really high , probably the maximum you could find on earth today for that climate and soil , but the brown areas and yellow areas are places where we &apos;re only getting maybe 20 or 30 percent of the yield you should be able to get .
all of that is necessary , but we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome .
this is about a place in london called kiteflyer &apos;s hill where i used to go and spend hours going &quot; &quot; when is he coming back ? when is he coming back ? &quot; &quot; so this is another one dedicated to that guy ...
music is not the only kind of sound , however , which affects your emotions .
in this case it &apos;s mies van der rohe &apos;s less is more .
and at the age of 17 , i moved to the united states , the world &apos;s greatest democracy .
if , however , i am right , whatever you do , don &apos;t keep it to yourself , ok ?
and these folks know something that we &apos;ve lost sight of .
( laughter ) sw : she &apos;s a comedian . i suppose you think you &apos;re famous ? are you famous ?
dawn , very good .
it was the sorrow that &apos;s taken so long .
after 11 complete mission failures , we got our first images from space .
we are coming at extremely high speeds , and we are deploying them to slow us down . so we have to do all kinds of tests .
they all look very different . but this language allows us to say that they are representations of the same symmetrical abstract object , which we call 4-4-2 . nothing to do with football , but because of the fact that there are two places where you can rotate by a quarter of a turn , and one by half a turn .
we love relationships — very complex . so we love this kind of stuff .
so rov stands for remote operated vehicle , which in our case means our little robot sends live video across that ultra-thin tether back to the computer topside .
canada was just pipped to the post in terms of the number one fundraising campaign in the world .
the other thing to use is your body .
for a time , we shared the stage with our distant cousins , neanderthal , who clearly had some spark of awareness , but — whether it was the increase in the size of the brain , or the development of language , or some other evolutionary catalyst — we quickly left neanderthal gasping for survival .
without iraq balancing iran , iran could now become a threat , some in israel argued .
sometimes it actually gets us onto a more productive path .
( nature sounds ) well , a year later i returned , and using the same protocols and recording under the same conditions , i recorded a number of examples of the same dawn choruses , and now this is what we &apos;ve got .
and then it &apos;s united states today , up here .
as you have been told , i &apos;m bulgarian .
on the one hand , result .
your bones regenerate every 10 years .
there &apos;s the centerfold from national geographic magazine with one of her caregivers , and she roams the web and has hundreds of hours of bina &apos;s mannerisms , personalities .
tool use must have enhanced our survival , mating and so on .
we can turn things that might seem small and obscure and blow them up until they &apos;re like constellations of information about life .
i was asked to come to tegucigalpa and talk again on january fourth and fifth .
as you can see the little tether , that it &apos;s also magnetically levitated .
now it &apos;s very hard to see the earth there , it &apos;s called the &quot; &quot; pale blue dot &quot; &quot; picture , but earth is suspended in that red shaft of light .
and the habitat destruction is unbelievable .
now that begins with economic power , but that &apos;s the way it always begins .
we have embedded the drug into devices that look like this one .
now , one of the nice characteristics of simple things is you know what it &apos;s going to do , in general .
it was totally irrational , but the amazing thing , the astounding thing , is that thousands of young japanese-american men and women again went from behind those barbed-wire fences , put on the same uniform as that of our guards , leaving their families in imprisonment , to fight for this country .
in ruby &apos;s world , you learn technology through play .
you may have been dissatisfied with this talk , but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff .
for the first time , we &apos;re tracking the promises that were made on clean transportation , and politicos know that they have to deliver it , but the tipping point will come when we form coalitions — citizens , companies , champions of public transportation — that will make electric mobility the new normal , especially in a developing country .
this red cup comes from rwanda from a child named fabian .
and she said , &quot; &quot; well , personally , i still feel like i have to curtsey when i see the president of my university .
what we came up with was an idea to exploit an old fact , or a known fact , about social networks , which goes like this : do you know that your friends have more friends than you do ?
even the government learned of the earthquake from their own citizens , rather than from the xinhua news agency .
then you have touch , which is about the speed of a usb key .
in 5,000 years , we &apos;ve gone backwards in getting around cities .
&quot; &quot; andy , andy , how are you doing ? &quot; &quot; she said , using the name of my older brother .
as i thought , that &apos;s most of you .
i am so excited to be here .
then i realized , maybe that &apos;s a little bit lofty for now .
it also is much more dynamic , so that you can see that the same form opens and closes in a very dynamic way as you move across it , because it has this quality of vector in motion built into it .
and so the next step — the sixth step beyond &quot; &quot; universal compassion &quot; &quot; — is this thing where you &apos;re linked with the needs of others in a true way , and you have compassion for yourself also , and it isn &apos;t sentimental only . you might be in fear of something .
we now think there are likely to be only just over 20,000 genes in the human genome .
if i had been able to simply fly to australia , it would have taken me less than 24 hours .
this is a girl in inner-city boston who had just done a high-tech on-demand craft sale in the inner city community center .
i need that data in september .
for even in my own life , there are memories i have that are difficult to explain — happenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird , that it is difficult to imagine they were not the result of prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life .
i know when a storm is coming .
what i want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there but go to a kind of regional scale — not just in terms of the scale of the fields , but in terms of the entire food network .
i don &apos;t really remember what my first introduction to poverty was but i do remember the most jarring .
and so while planning is important , so is flexibility .
at 31 , he was not able to relate the kind of &#91; unclear &#93; research , which he was doing with the lives of the ordinary people .
so , i wanted to open his eyes up to how much symmetry is running through the alhambra .
it &apos;s like this very fast , very efficient way to get people off the street .
from your beginnings in africa , through each generation , may be passed on to you , in your creation . it &apos;s a secret urge , hiding deep in you .
it &apos;s only half the length of this one .
it reminds me of my college days .
because what we did with these girls is to understand their potential .
can never tell if it &apos;s on .
because when you &apos;re seeing the middle east , you see only the bad news .
your ears can &apos;t hear that chord ; they can actually hear amazing things . your ears can hear 10 octaves .
and then you need to add some more ports , and more .
so what happens when i switch on that light ?
and this is really where we were headed .
i wanted to come home .
bao yongxiu : &quot; &quot; my mother tells me to come home and get married , but if i marry now , before i have fully developed myself , i can only marry an ordinary worker , so i &apos;m not in a rush . &quot; &quot; chen ying : &quot; &quot; when i went home for the new year , everyone said i had changed . they asked me , what did you do that you have changed so much ?
and at that period it was — in a way , a number of things were happening .
when i meet her in her office in herat , she enters surrounded by four large men with four huge guns .
if we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces out of hostile , inhospitable spaces here on earth , perhaps we can meet the needs of both preserving our own environment and moving beyond it .
and i thought , surely , we do better than that .
it adds together the interference pattern from two raindrops that land near each other .
but i believe such people can change .
which i &apos;m sure you wouldn &apos;t want .
it has 3d vision and surround sound for what you &apos;re seeing and hearing right now , but that &apos;s just the start of it .
as individuals or in groups , volunteers or military conflicts , there are hackers everywhere .
okay , most of you .
tell us what you want in a spaghetti sauce . &quot; &quot; and for all those years — 20 , 30 years — through all those focus group sessions , no one ever said they wanted extra-chunky .
this is on a mercator projection .
man : aw , shit .
love came to visit me , shy as a fawn .
( laughter ) &quot; i feel confused and unsure of what the hell i want to do . &quot;
to become great , he didn &apos;t spend all his time just being an orator or a lawyer , which would be his performance zone .
stroop tests have been done with metaphor as well .
when i &apos;m on my deathbed , i &apos;m going to remember one story more than any other .
and let &apos;s cut the crap for a second .
so for instance , here is somebody using the tool .
but also have the body language communicate something to the person who is looking at it .
i dedicated the past two years to understanding how people achieve their dreams .
( laughter ) ( applause ) or as short as i wanted , depending on who i was dating . ( laughter )
( laughter ) my organization , gram vikas , which means &quot; &quot; village development organization , &quot; &quot; was working in the area of renewable energy .
there &apos;s only been two concepts tried — two by the u.s. and one by the russians .
a few years ago , i spent months in europe to see the major international art exhibitions that have the pulse of what is supposed to be going on in the art world .
so when i had my ted wish last year , i said , look , i &apos;m going to switch my concept .
so what a fetus is learning about in utero is not mozart &apos;s &quot; &quot; magic flute &quot; &quot; but answers to questions much more critical to its survival .
i work with vibration .
so i think these are not technical difficulties .
this one has a little cave in his chest .
( laughter ) what were we just talking about ? ( laughter )
these c.o.s play a big factor in these young people &apos;s lives for x amount of time until a disposition is reached on their case .
in no other latin american country are there more than a couple of thousand .
( laughter ) i was never here . ( laughter )
i bought a computer , and &#91; they &#93; told me it had millions of colors in it .
we just need a good idea , motivation and lots of chutzpah , and we could save millions of people that otherwise would not be saved .
what we look for in firemen , in climbers , in policemen , and what we should look for in intervention , is intelligent risk takers — not people who plunge blind off a cliff , not people who jump into a burning room , but who weigh their risks , weigh their responsibilities .
as you get further and further away from the pump , the deaths begin to grow less and less frequent .
so the question is , can we make it ?
and this is a comet , captured by dr. euan mason .
and then new particles might show up in our data as bumps — slight deviations from what you expect , little clusters of data points that make a smooth line not so smooth .
thank you .
but ... maybe not .
what they decided to do was they would first try and slow down this epidemic by rapidly building as many beds as possible in specialized treatment centers so that they could prevent the disease from spreading from those were infected .
but even though recent , this metaphor of the network , is really already adopting various shapes and forms , and it &apos;s almost becoming a growing visual taxonomy .
i &apos;m sticking in my arm , i &apos;m giving them a big juicy blood meal , i &apos;m shaking them off , and we follow them through time to see these mosquitos get very , very sick indeed , here shown in fast motion , and three hours later what we see at the bottom of the cage is dead mosquitos , very dead mosquitos , and i &apos;m going to say , ladies and gentlemen , we have swapped the cards with mosquitos .
he said roughly what &apos;s been said before .
then i started doing animatronics .
i invite your interest as well as your involvement in driving this vision to a point of practical reality .
so just a few miles from here at children &apos;s national medical center , when patients come into the doctor &apos;s office , they &apos;re asked a few questions .
and then two weeks later , iqbal quadir can issue his electricity in bangladesh bonds .
did you know that ireland got 3 billion dollars in aid ?
who would do this ?
it is the largest ongoing humanitarian crisis in the world .
in fact , the natural world is organized hierarchically upwards , not downwards , but upwards , and we begin with a self-regulating , semi-autonomous unit called a cell .
the fact is , though , that even when we &apos;re alone , we &apos;re a profoundly social creature . we &apos;re not a solitary mind built out of properties that kept it alive in the world independent of other people . in fact , our minds depend on other people . they depend on other people , and they &apos;re expressed in other people , so the notion of who you are , you often don &apos;t know who you are until you see yourself in interaction with people that are close to you , people that are enemies of you , people that are agnostic to you .
he &apos;s been a collector all of his life , starting when he was four or five in the early 1960 &apos;s .
so even though i have a fear of heights , i recently strapped myself to another human being and stepped out of an airplane at 12,000 ft .
so its military budget is bound to be enormous .
this is blue gene , the fastest computer in the world .
this is a difficult , unstable binary .
it &apos;s open source .
it was so mystifying : we couldn &apos;t make out what we were seeing on titan .
and i say that because we live in a society that &apos;s so obsessed with black death .
you see , only that way you can be able to understand him .
you see , here &apos;s huck ; he &apos;s an illiterate kid ; he &apos;s had no schooling , but there &apos;s something in him .
a week later , they held the most well-attended and disciplined demonstration to date .
these are techniques that can be used to be — that can be applied in a wide range of problem solving .
as a result , everything is happening in crisis mode .
now this is the neurological goldmine , if you like , because a known reward excites people , but what really gets them going is the uncertain reward , the reward pitched at the right level of uncertainty , that they didn &apos;t quite know whether they were going to get it or not .
( laughter ) so , think of it this way .
so this is a microscopy , a video i shot , and it &apos;s about 100 times magnification , sped up about 20 times , and inside the slime mold , there is a rhythmic pulsing flow , a vein-like structure carrying cellular material , nutrients and chemical information through the cell , streaming first in one direction and then back in another .
when you walked into those rooms , they smelled really bad , and our data suggests that it had something to do with leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup from people the day before .
so i could present things to him while he &apos;s in the scanner .
we didn &apos;t grasp what was going on .
in tanzania last week , we had the launch of the east african organic produce standard .
as in , for instance , that little matter of virgins and paradise .
they started with cinematch , and they &apos;ve tried a bunch of others — there &apos;s dinosaur planet ; there &apos;s gravity .
so the internet , which you can surf the web anywhere you are in the world ; gps , where you can actually know where you are anywhere in the world ; the touchscreen display , which makes it also a really easy-to-use phone for anybody .
( applause ) because we want to create — we want to create the classroom of tomorrow .
like this .
well , that &apos;s the good news .
you &apos;re making unexpected connections .
( laughter ) like , what have i got to say about all this ?
this is very good because we could potentially move everything apart in the brain .
i had to wash my bed sheet after every period , even if it was not stained .
i will fulfill the wish .
i couldn &apos;t believe i was on the other side of the world .
the first thing they did was to recognize the specificity of political jurisdiction inscribed in that empty space .
he did a lot of this work in the &apos; 60s , and so a lot of this logic theory lay fallow as we went down the digital computer revolution , but it &apos;s now coming back .
and even if counterintuitive , it &apos;s good news .
some of the ideas are strange .
and it &apos;s a responsibility that i don &apos;t take lightly .
so , what your letter means : i &apos;ve got to tell you , we are all in a party , and political officials are the pinatas .
( laughter ) i &apos;m going to try to square a four-digit number this time .
and he had his arm outstretched like someone out of the apprentice .
we need to increase the production . &quot; &quot; &quot; excuse me ? &quot;
so i called back and i told her , &quot; &quot; look , amy , tell the ted guys i just won &apos;t show up .
not necessarily .
what sounds like faith , soft faith , may actually be fact , because the surprising truth — i mean , there are no studies , but the truth seems to be that these women who returned to their homes and have lived on some of the most radioactive land on earth for the last 27 years , have actually outlived their counterparts who accepted relocation , by some estimates up to 10 years .
and so this photograph shows a small boy next to a codfish .
most people say women .
listen , listen , listen . now — what can we do with thunder ?
now , the way we accomplish this is by sharing data between the vehicles .
lone twin had come to minto and worked with the residents , and they had created these dances .
and that &apos;s kind of been a big lesson to me , that you can &apos;t act on any object .
so if you look at the character carefully , you see there are lots of body movements going on , none of which you have to animate like in the old days .
and i &apos;m rather proud to say that this was found just near london , and that 55 million years ago london was full of mangroves .
so you could go in , you could get your tummy-tuck .
we even have skyscrapers built for cars .
but i didn &apos;t start out obsessed with food .
but it &apos;s limited , because really to know if it &apos;s a healthy restaurant , you need to taste the food , you need to know what goes on in the kitchen , you need the product of all of those ingredients .
now , the standard story is that computers descend from military technology , since many of the early computers were designed specifically to crack wartime codes or calculate rocket trajectories .
but so those are all parts of our bodies where we very directly interact with our environment , in a direct confrontation , if you like .
then sort of take a leap and think about the universe forming .
in rare but striking instances , a single lie told by just one entity in this honeycomb can lead to real trouble .
and i was hooked again on the importance of what i did .
so , we ’ ll go with the first piece .
the women are very good about getting mammograms now .
america &apos;s favorite pie is ?
this talk is about being prepared for , and resilient to the changes that are coming and that will affect our homes and our collective home , the earth .
and often , i &apos;ll hear people say , who maybe know that i did this film , and they say , &quot; &quot; oh , you know , i &apos;m against the war , but i support the soldiers . &quot; &quot; and i &apos;ve started to ask them , &quot; &quot; well , that &apos;s nice . what are you doing ?
now , the question of course is , what happened here ?
for instance , in the last half-century , more girls were discriminated to death than all the people killed on all the battlefields in the 20th century .
a remarkable , remarkable testament to the power of evolution .
or some people dance in clubs .
we have to demand this new kind of technology .
we have almost 14 million roots .
one thing that i &apos;ve left out of this narrative is the obvious thing , which is the focus of the rest of my little talk , and that is other people .
these are ongoing experiments .
this works with a laser sensor that &apos;s mounted on top of rezero .
of course , he &apos;d get really bored .
did anybody stop inventing ? not a person . not a soul .
before i started this ted process and climbed up on this stage , i had told literally a handful of people about it , because , like many a journalist , i am far more interested in learning about your stories than sharing much , if anything , about my own .
you gotta carry the bottle , you gotta carry the syringe .
also , they operate at high temperatures , and the fuel is molten , so they can &apos;t melt down , but in the event that the reactor ever went out of tolerances , or you lost off-site power in the case of something like fukushima , there &apos;s a dump tank .
and we &apos;ve got cradle-to-cradle gold on this thing .
and here is a surprise .
after all , the long-playing record was developed in the early 1930s , and now we put talking books on cds using the digital access system known as daisy .
ag : thank you so much for bringing me back to ted .
now , i &apos;m going to move now from this kind of — the sublime in the traditional sense of the word , that is to say , awe-inspiring , terrifying — to the somewhat more mundane .
many archaeologists have devoted their lives to unraveling the mysteries of the past under hot suns and arctic winds and in dense rainforests .
we want to be able to see our predators , but we also want to feel that our flanks are covered .
&#91; light in slow motion ... 10 billion x slow &#93; now , the whole event — ( applause ) now remember , the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nanosecond — that &apos;s how much time it takes for light to travel .
you all know about multitasking . you all have been faulty of multitasking when you &apos;re driving and you pick up your cellphone . bad idea . very bad idea .
this was how mantis shrimps make these very fast strikes .
we stayed full-time students , but in between we traveled , performing and teaching nine-year-olds to mfa candidates , from california to indiana to india to a public high school just up the street from campus .
over the next few months , my small nonprofit organization of less than 20 people was joined by more than 350 other reporters from 25 language groups .
we were really paralyzed .
all of this happens in seconds .
the retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here .
now , you should know that at that time , the textile industry in the south was notoriously segregated .
but what are we doing with it ?
why ? air quality was the reason they used natural gas and got away from diesel .
i &apos;m a product designer by trade .
and you can imagine being on an island hoping you &apos;re going to see penguins , and you &apos;re in the middle of an el nino event and there are no penguins .
if you have content that others are uploading to youtube , you should register in the content id system , and then you &apos;ll have the choice about how your content is used .
they want to figure out how things work , and they want to do it in groups , like this hackers club in washington , d.c. , that uses our materials to offer community courses .
now metaphor is ubiquitous , yet it &apos;s hidden .
technology has come of age that &apos;s allowing us to see the earth from space and go deep into the seas remotely .
we start with sherman in a chinese restaurant , who gets a fortune that he &apos;s about to get caught by a trawler , which he does .
so the way that works is if you take two very , very fine patterns and you move them across each other , you will see a gross pattern that a microscope can see that otherwise you would not be able to see .
we felt that they were out of date .
and i woke up one day and i said , &quot; i don &apos;t need prozac anymore . &quot;
if i turn it off , we see it drops .
mechanical engineers design air handling units to make sure that people are comfortable , that the air flow and temperature is just right .
but every once in a while , like lizzie borden , like three times a century , and we &apos;re kind of due .
and so one of the tools that we can use to sample the oceans is acoustics , or sound waves .
my estimation is that probably 45 of you are absolutely passionate about classical music .
and that is that some of the most important learning we ever do happens before we &apos;re born , while we &apos;re still in the womb .
in the end , the grass is often greener on my side of the fence , although we don &apos;t realize it .
we &apos;re bees . we busted out of the hive during the enlightenment .
so i know at ted you &apos;re supposed to have a change-the-world kind of thing .
and they were able to change therapies , including disabling the device — and this is with a real , commercial , off-the-shelf device — simply by performing reverse engineering and sending wireless signals to it .
christmas morning , where we open up our gifts , where we have special prayers , and where we get to the old upright piano and we would sing carols . it was a very intimate moment .
so even if the tumor is not right on the surface , you &apos;ll still be able to see it .
we push that material to extruders where we melt it , push it through small die holes , make spaghetti-like plastic strands .
the outstanding — the salient problem about this for us is that these are places that are not worth caring about .
what you really want is not a sequential , not parallel development .
what if from the women in africa who cannot sell any food — there &apos;s no roads , there &apos;s no warehouses , there &apos;s not even a tarp to pick the food up with — what if we give the enabling environment for them to provide the food to feed the hungry children elsewhere ?
this collagen is the stuff between cells .
how do you get them mobilized around the world if you &apos;ve shut all the airports down ?
if i can find this , i can &apos;t make the phone explode .
we have no such anchors and benchmarks for decisions in messy human affairs .
as citizens , i &apos;m asking you not to leave any child behind .
here , i &apos;ll show it to you .
and on the 3rd of july 2013 , the army ousted egypt &apos;s first democratically elected president , after three days of popular protest that demanded his resignation .
i don &apos;t want to get in trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; okay . one bite . what the hell ? &quot;
but more significantly , they gave me the ability to believe , totally , to believe that i could .
we are now replicating this in a 1.75-million-square-feet building , which will have 60,000 indoor plants .
all of this integrated into the same medical adhesives that are used in the hospital .
if you &apos;re under 50 we want you to work four more years .
those 20 dollars might have been a quick lunch .
it &apos;s that the same plant has got leaves that are different shapes and sizes .
( laughter ) this is the real pinocchio effect .
second category is online philanthropy marketplaces .
and after we saw his slide show , it became clear that it was much more urgent .
some teachers are far more effective than others .
ynh : yes . in the industrial revolution , we saw the creation of a new class of the urban proletariat .
if we can get the 10 cents , all the rest of it flows .
if i flipped a coin 100 times but then withheld the results from you from half of those tosses , i could make it look as if i had a coin that always came up heads .
i was a young driver out on the highway , and the car in front of me , i saw the brake lights go on .
and we probably need , well , we probably need a cowboy to be quite honest .
and i think understanding that could revolutionize tax policy .
the only reason these things have any value is because we &apos;ve all decided they should .
and this surgery came along and basically made me who i am today and saved my life .
so what do such savings mean for the electricity that is three-fifths used in motors ?
in fact , on that other side is the area , tora bora , the area where osama bin laden &apos;s supposed to be . this is the tribal area .
you look at them in september , they &apos;ve gone down .
when i was four years old , i have a vivid memory of finding two pinpoint scars on my ankle and asking my dad what they were .
try to get dsl installed in your house .
it &apos;s the moment where all the pieces come together , and suddenly the world comes to life as if it &apos;s an actual place that exists .
it &apos;s directly embedded ; there &apos;s no external instructions .
when my own daughter was born a couple of years ago by emergency c-section , we took matters into our own hands and made sure she was coated with those vaginal microbes that she would have gotten naturally .
just 3 years ago , both the u.s. and france were saying they were investing militarily in cyberspace , strictly to defend their it systems .
so , technology is selfish ; technology is generous .
this is a place , in a way , that i just would like you to , in a way , look at differently because of this event that has happened in it , a human event , and in general , it just asks us to look again at this world , so different from , in a way , the world that we have been sharing with each other , the technological world , to look again at the elemental world .
and i think total personalization in this new world will require total transparency .
my pals in the crocodile specialist group of the iucn , the &#91; madras crocodile bank &#93; , an ngo , the world wildlife fund , the wildlife institute of india , state forest departments , and the ministry of environment , we all work together on stuff .
but potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology that can come from this project .
it wasn &apos;t a baseball player ; it was linus pauling .
and you &apos;re pretty rich by the standards of the world at large .
but then it warms up , and the tuna pops in , gets some fish , maybe comes back to home base , goes in again and then comes back to winter down there in north carolina and then on to the bahamas .
it &apos;s a conversation about augmentation .
we are a company that sells soap and soup .
wouldn &apos;t it be interesting to take this way of thinking and arguing , engaging seriously with big moral questions , exploring cultural differences and connect through a live video hookup , students in beijing and mumbai and in cambridge , massachusetts and create a global classroom .
the four countries have no access to facebook .
and so it turns out we &apos;re so stereotypical , our brains have got dedicated neural circuitry to decode this stereotyping .
they start flimsy and they get substantial as time goes by .
and that deeper , underlying point is that science is in the process of redefining life as we know it .
this is from the front .
this is in montana , 2008 .
probably the biggest change was understanding that the generational difference , the ages , had changed so much .
now what does that mean ?
i did research and volunteered to help with fund-raising events , and whenever i could , i talked with those who had survived their own suicidal crisis or attempt .
and then you have tv guide , a fox property , which is about to sponsor the online video awards — but cancels it out of sympathy with traditional television , not appearing to gloat .
events like post-ups , and pick-and-rolls , and isolations .
and for example , i don &apos;t really talk like that , but that was one of my people , and i &apos;m going to bring a few of my friends — i think of them as my friends — to this stage , in this spirit of the idea that the present is the new future , in sort of a meta way , because i thought about it , and the future , for me , what can be so frightening is that i don &apos;t know what &apos;s coming .
you &apos;ve got to figure out what they actually meant .
so for some reason , this was what i wanted to have a crack at , but i knew that even to stand a chance of getting home in one piece , let alone make it across to canada , i had to take a radical approach .
i thought , this is somebody i &apos;ve got to get in this series .
what are we going to do about it ?
we all know the earth is in trouble .
so we need to be thinking a little bit in those terms .
i want to start with this slide , because this slide sort of tells the story the way science magazine thinks of it .
one of the things that we &apos;re taught in high school is that all animals require oxygen in order to survive .
for some people it &apos;s only about what is in the immediate situation , what other people are doing and what you &apos;re feeling .
they &apos;re these special wheels that can move equally easily in all directions , and when you couple these robots with a video projector , you have these physical tools for interacting with digital information .
but that &apos;s what local governments across the country are doing to people who are poor .
because of a scarcity of land , we are using the sacks to grow vegetables , and also &#91; we &apos;re &#93; able to save on the cost of living .
things like invisible obama or the famous &quot; &quot; binders full of women &quot; &quot; that came up during the 2012 election cycle , or even the fan fiction universe of &quot; &quot; west wing &quot; &quot; twitter in which you have all of these accounts for every single one of the characters in &quot; &quot; the west wing , &quot; &quot; including the bird that taps at josh lyman &apos;s window in one single episode . ( laughter ) all of these are rapid iterations on a theme .
so as you go further away from the sun , this becomes more and more powerful .
even building codes actually limit the ability for us to build much taller than four stories in many places , and that &apos;s true here in the united states .
go to the website . look at the audit results .
now — ( laughter ) — i love that word , superrabbit .
there &apos;s a long list of innovations that we &apos;ve come up with there that are a little difficult to communicate in this talk , but — ca : not least because you could still get copied , right ?
so the upshot was this .
and here comes the second term into play , what i call &quot; &quot; narrative hybrids &quot; &quot; — structures of multiple simultaneous stories that unfold throughout the buildings we create .
designing it is one thing ; getting it built , we learned , is quite another .
we &apos;ve just started to scratch the surface of what you can do with this kind of imaging , because it gives us a new way to capture our surroundings with common , accessible technology .
it can take a randomly shuffled rubik &apos;s cube .
let &apos;s do something a little more difficult .
( sniffs ) ( coughs ) have a smell of that , mister cameraman .
over time i &apos;ve collected about a half-dozen methods that do work — of course there are many more — that do work and that are effective .
and so we walked back up to the mountain two days later .
engineer : absolutely . interviewer : you thought , &quot; &quot; oh , bother . &quot; &quot; engineer : i felt i was disappointed about it .
where was wislawa szymborska during all this ?
in rural uganda , paul bolton and his colleagues , using villagers , demonstrated that they could deliver interpersonal psychotherapy for depression and , using a randomized control design , showed that 90 percent of the people receiving this intervention recovered as compared to roughly 40 percent in the comparison villages .
she has achieved a modest prosperity that i believe is the human right of every hardworking person on the planet .
her wish was to make a pilgrimage to tibet .
they &apos;re responsible for about 7 million deaths per year , and there is no adequate vaccination method for any of those .
put that in play .
thank you .
odds are pretty good that many of those things you wanted 10 years ago you now have .
thousands of people around the country who could give his presentation for him , because he can &apos;t be in 100 or 200 or 500 cities in each night .
and then i can say , &quot; &quot; well , just show me the stuff that affects heart health . &quot; &quot; so let &apos;s filter that out .
now let &apos;s look at another part of the world , the former soviet republics of central asia , the &apos; stans .
so if you are concerned to influence energy policy , or you are concerned to influence national security policy , or health policy , or education , science — and a particular branch of science — is a way to do it , not the way we &apos;ve been doing it , which is seat-of-the-pants wisdom .
the lowest number of combatant casualties occurred in 2003 , with just 20,000 killed .
and the last operation was to think about the cell , the small cell of the project , like the apartment , as an essential part of the master plan .
rm : before i moved to chicago in 2005 , i didn &apos;t even know cities had their own flags .
it &apos;s called mass transit .
today , the action takes place in a distant time and place , which gives the viewer a sense of detachment from what &apos;s happening , a sense of separation .
ca : so you picture , at some point , live , in real time , you could have this kind of conversation , inviting questions , but with people from china and india joining in ?
i &apos;ve talked for three minutes .
but , you know , we &apos;ve just come from this discussion of what a bird might be .
( laughter ) it &apos;s impossible , of course , for your eyes to see themselves , but they seem to be trying .
i probably would have already taken my own life , as so many others have done .
and just as 30 years ago we couldn &apos;t conceive that we would have the power of a mainframe computer that took up a room this size in our purses and on our belts , that we &apos;re carrying around in our cell phone today , and suddenly , computing , that used to be an expert driven system , it was a personal system that we all owned as part of our daily lives — that shift from mainframe to personal computing is what we have to do for healthcare .
our friends think we &apos;re mad .
and as you &apos;re thinking of the consequences of that , it &apos;s getting really hard to hide from this stuff , among other things , because it &apos;s not just the electronic tattoos , it &apos;s facial recognition that &apos;s getting really good .
it looks at the territory of the united states as if it were a wheat field that is procured by the winds and that is really giving you a pictorial image of what &apos;s going on with the winds in the united states .
we have no other option , so i &apos;m very curious to see what &apos;s going to happen .
if you want to change the world , it helps to have a good cross-section of society on your side .
nearly no prisoner resisted without giving a testimony .
and that &apos;s sort of like this lone guy in the backyard , you know — &quot; &quot; i accidentally built a 747 . &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to happen .
that people can read the transcripts is horrific enough , but a few weeks later , the audio tapes are aired on tv , and significant portions made available online .
but more importantly , it was linked in to the andean notions of sacred geography .
don &apos;t panic — don &apos;t panic now , i &apos;ll help you through this .
this coral is eight meters tall , right .
( laughter ) but africans were using this platform to take some kind of ownership of the tourism sectors .
there are literally hundreds of those kinds of communities across the middle east , across the path .
those were the imaginations that were going through my mind every day .
we do have the technology that &apos;s scaleable , and our network of global partners has been expanding and can be expanded at a rapid rate , so we &apos;re comfortable that this task can be accomplished .
and what do all these pictures and events have in common ?
i &apos;ll figure something out .
it saved me when i was in the middle of writing &quot; &quot; eat , pray , love , &quot; &quot; and i fell into one of those sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster , the worst book ever written .
like , i like my voice .
but when you look at that , you have to remember that this machine did not do any physical trials on how to move forward , nor did it have a model of itself .
these differences were highly significant .
remember when we landed humans on the moon ?
because it &apos;s got all those a &apos;s lined up i guess .
some can glide as flat as 60 feet forward for every foot of descent .
it &apos;s crap .
they want to be missed .
one seemingly small aspect of the overall relief effort became increasingly important as the delivery of food and water started rolling .
the body is something changeable — anyone may develop a disability at any point .
so that lesson was the lesson that &quot; &quot; do not draw attention to yourself either in the home or outside of the home . &quot; &quot; maybe it &apos;s a migrant lesson .
ken knowlton does wonderful composite images , like creating jacques cousteau out of seashells — un-retouched seashells , but just by rearranging them . he did einstein out of dice because , after all , einstein said , &quot; &quot; god does not play dice with the universe . &quot; &quot; bert herzog out of un-retouched keyboards . will shortz , crossword puzzle . john cederquist does these wonderful trompe l &apos;oeil cabinets .
you &apos;ve heard it said before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today , that less is more .
and lo and behold , the hiccups went away .
no salt , no pepper , no oil , no spices .
and after we experimented with different flavors of cheese , i realized , well , this is a directed attack .
netflix was right — the netflix model could capitalize on the dvd in a way that the video-rental stores couldn &apos;t .
i want to tell you a little bit about this photograph .
i watched these films in wonder , transfixed , fireworks going off in my head , thinking , &quot; &quot; that is what i want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; the idea that all the math , science and code i had been learning could come together to create these worlds and characters and stories i connected with , was pure magic for me .
this graph shows that our bacteria really do have a genetic pathway to biodegrade phthalates .
before making my own mother &apos;s day card , i thought i would take a look at the scratch website .
her eyes were extra bright and extra blue , as a result .
that was 70 years ago , and the way we gain informed consent , this tool that was created to protect us from harm , now creates silos . so the data that we collect for prostate cancer or for alzheimer &apos;s trials goes into silos where it can only be used for prostate cancer or for alzheimer &apos;s research .
when we slow it down 50 times we see how the leg is hitting that simulated debris .
in the 1930s , roosevelt put thousands and thousands of americans back to work by building bridges and infrastructure and tunnels , but he also did something interesting , which was to hire a few hundred writers to scour america to capture the stories of ordinary americans .
( laughter ) some of the happiest days of my life have been spent ... ( laughter )
that &apos;s a wire running down the middle , and not only is it a wire , if you take that piano circuit , you can thumbtack into the middle of a pencil , and you can lay out wire on the page , too , and get electrical current to run through it .
it &apos;s a secret . the animal effectively climbs by slipping and look — and doing , actually , terribly , with respect to grabbing on the surface .
i have a b.a. in english from harvard college , an mba in marketing from wharton business school .
i use the word &quot; &quot; want . &quot; &quot; technology wants .
blog about it , tweet about it , talk about it , and commit a hundred percent , because very , very few things are impossible to achieve if we really put our whole minds to it .
and in all of those countries , you can see , not more than four percent of injectors ever became infected with hiv .
a photo is a reminder of someone or something , a place , a relationship , a loved one .
for example , what do you see here ?
it &apos;s a deflationary force , if not handled right .
( laughter ) it &apos;s all curled up .
of those rats that don &apos;t abort , atrazine causes prostate disease in the pups so the sons are born with an old man &apos;s disease .
and lastly i &apos;ve realized , in experimenting with this device , that i also kind of have a nervous tic .
so there goes my theory of necrophilia .
the dendritic pattern you see mimics the growth of mushroom mycelia , which are the equivalent of plant roots .
so , i want to argue today that the fundamental source of africa &apos;s inability to engage the rest of the world in a more productive relationship is because it has a poor institutional and policy framework .
so i took the approach that the chair should do as much for them as humanly possible or as mechanistically possible so that they didn &apos;t have to fuss with it .
today it &apos;s less than 50 cents a day .
and then you think of how lovely beings are when they are happy , when they are satisfied .
intensive agriculture is based on the use of chemical fertilizers .
they watch the tops of our heads moving below on earth .
it is common for hominids to evolve .
we live in a world where gdp is the benchmark of success in a global economy .
as telecoms sector grew , housing and construction , and i could go on and on . and this is to illustrate to you that once you get the macro-economy straightened out , the opportunities in various other sectors are enormous .
on a continent where more than a handful of leaders have been in power longer than the majority of the populations has been alive , we are in desperate need of something new , something that works .
we are not creating enough decent manufacturing jobs for our youth , and trade among ourselves is low .
mood modifiers have been used from time immemorial — caffeine , alcohol , nicotine , immune system enhancement , vision enhancement , anesthetics — we take that very much for granted , but just think about how great progress that is — like , having an operation before anesthetics was not fun .
now , i don &apos;t know if one of the editors was a woman , but that can make the biggest difference .
( laughter ) i would prefer to keep doing this work that i love .
i &apos;m going to show you the six vocal warm-up exercises that i do before every talk i ever do .
and the reason i &apos;m saying this is that you may have the idea this problem is relatively recent .
i don &apos;t know quite where this diktat comes from .
but what we found over the past few months is that this approach — that we &apos;re pretty much standard upon — is incredibly powerful .
we are not good at reasoning with uncertainty .
and how might that change their lives ?
and they wouldn &apos;t tell me .
she is always happy and eternally young .
this is some aluminum foil , right ? you use it in the kitchen .
and so i do like something which is pointed , not blunt , something which is focused on reality , something that has the power , through its leverage , to transform even a very small space .
so what will that tell us about the origin of life and the meaning of life ?
i &apos;m not a vegetarian — this is the old nixon line , right ?
but here &apos;s the thing : that vision of abundance isn &apos;t compatible with a world that still relies on a 20th-century nuclear doctrine called &quot; &quot; mutually assured destruction . &quot; &quot; it has to be about building the foundations for the 22nd century .
( laughter ) as i walk out of the house from my wi-fi hotspot into the cellular network on a call with my wife — look at the upper left . that &apos;s the wi-fi signal .
what drew me to skateboarding , the freedom , was now restored , where i could just create things , because that &apos;s where the joy was for me , always , was creating new stuff .
and so in my lab at stanford , my students and i are asking , what should we be working on now ?
these neurons will fire when a person performs a specific action .
except , of course , as you &apos;ve probably guessed , that it doesn &apos;t , because the whole thing is a complete myth .
and what i need to tell you is that on 100 acres he gets 40,000 pounds of beef ; 30,000 pounds of pork ; 25,000 dozen eggs ; 20,000 broilers ; 1,000 turkeys ; 1,000 rabbits — an immense amount of food .
you can come when you are in curitiba and have a coffee there .
you get services , like reddit and wordpress are actually accepting bitcoin as a payment currency now .
there were several other activities .
because , again , i think , sort of , putting our money where our mouth is , here .
wanting to do the right thing in the right way for the right reasons .
there are errors everywhere , errors in the document , it &apos;s the wrong name of the captain , some of the boats never actually took to sea .
this is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions .
the first one is that not all media are created equal .
thank you .
and the physician will then take a regular mr scan .
these are the surfaces the monkey is using to manipulate the tool .
you have stop signals — we have up to eight stop signals .
there &apos;s no big room to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms .
so , i grew up in this neighborhood . when i was 15 years old , i went from being what i think was a strapping young athlete , over four months , slowly wasting away until i was basically a famine victim with an unquenchable thirst .
there &apos;s no question about it .
so these funerals are characterized by elaborate rituals that tie people in a system of reciprocal debt based on the amount of animals — pigs , chickens and , most importantly , water buffalo — that are sacrificed and distributed in the name of the deceased .
below is what most swimmers will find enables them to do what i did , which is going from 21 strokes per 20-yard length to 11 strokes in two workouts with no coach , no video monitoring .
and as the number of people who are older , above retirement age and getting older , as they increase , there will be less people to take care of them .
( laughter ) empathy is old , but empathy , like everything else in life , comes on a sliding scale and has its elaboration .
but here instead are examples , you can already 3d-print textiles , which is very interesting .
many were bulldozed under at the time of the accident , but a few are left like this , kind of silent vestiges to the tragedy .
it has parallel lines , which are sun rays .
xiè xie .
is london a great big whale ?
that was a very moving piece .
and so chapter one really begins today , with all of us , because within each of us is the power to equal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps .
in the middle of my ph.d. , i was hopelessly stuck .
i just remember a feeling of surprise ; surprise at finding a street with no cars , as opposed to the nearby mass . ave. full of cars ; surprise at finding a street draped by leaves and surrounded by trees .
but it turns out that the logic of the support group is value neutral .
and we then call that schizophrenia .
for example , have you ever considered that there are listening positions , places you can listen from ?
in addition to which there &apos;s an enormous amount of back and forth , mentoring of one student by another , of all the students by the doctors , and the result is a generation — we hope — of doctors who do have time for the people they treat .
they have weekly study groups , where teachers get together and talk about what &apos;s working .
many people , i think , on our planet right now despair , and they think we &apos;ve reached a point where we &apos;ve discovered most of the things .
two gigawatts comes through the chunnel .
&quot; &quot; moneyball &quot; &quot; is about to come out , and it &apos;s all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team .
in some cases , it &apos;s recyclable .
we might endlessly feel guilty that we are not making the right choices , and that &apos;s why we didn &apos;t succeed .
it &apos;s definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge , but it &apos;s also pretty exhilarating , because it &apos;s beautiful up there , and you &apos;re looking out on a beautiful view .
thank you .
i know famous musicians , i know actors and film stars and millionaires and novelists and top lawyers and television executives and magazine editors and national journalists and dustbinmen and hairdressers , all who were looked after children , fostered , adopted or orphaned , and many of them grow into their adult lives in fear of speaking of their background , as if it may somehow weaken their standing in the foreground , as if it were somehow kryptonite , as if it were a time bomb strapped on the inside . children in care , who &apos;ve had a life in care , deserve the right to own and live the memory of their own childhood .
well , to love well and to work well , you need wisdom .
and it &apos;s not easy to change their minds .
but actually , i don &apos;t think it should be weird .
( applause ) i used to be a professor teaching about this .
we need to educate the staff .
and there &apos;s several ways of doing this , but one of the most popular ones involves using antibodies .
you can buy his trailer , and you &apos;d probably get a really good deal because he wants to get out of town as soon as possible .
we realized that the most convenient way to highlight the presence of the probiotics , and hence , the presence of the tumors , was to get these bacteria to produce a signal that would be detectable in the urine , and so we specifically programmed these probiotics to make a molecule that would change the color of your urine to indicate the presence of cancer .
they even use the brand name he created for his jihad .
whatever it was for you , i bet that , among other things , this gave you a little more freedom , a little more time .
so this video was made by a youtube user called tamez85 .
there &apos;s another one which suggests that 30 million hectares of land in europe , an area the size of poland , will be vacated by farmers between 2000 and 2030 .
you &apos;d like to see a colony on mars .
because in the balloon , like in life , we go very well in unforeseen directions .
that is because the human mind is a complex system with many parts , and some of them can inhibit others .
i &apos;m in the crucible right now .
some women have those heart attacks , but a whole bunch of women have this kind of heart attack , where it erodes , doesn &apos;t completely fill with clot , symptoms are subtle , ekg findings are different — female-pattern .
as fascism took over europe in the 1930s , an unlikely reaction came out of north america .
as appealing as it might sound , you cannot algorithmically data mine your way to the answer .
but it rarely happens in biology .
of course , the first computer was built just after world war ii to solve military problems , but things got really interesting just a couple of years later — 1949 with whirlwind , built at mit &apos;s lincoln lab . jay forrester was building this for the navy , but you can &apos;t help but see that the creator of this machine had in mind a machine that might actually be a potential media star .
you see , there was a time when you weren &apos;t afraid of failure , when you were a great artist or a great dancer and you could sing , you were good at math , you could build things , you were an astronaut , an adventurer , jacques cousteau , you could jump higher , run faster , kick harder than anyone .
even if everybody changed , it wouldn &apos;t solve the problem .
today , cancer detection happens mainly when symptoms appear .
humans have been drawn to honeybees since early recorded history , mostly to harvest their honey , which is an amazing natural sweetener .
i have several colleagues who worked in the development of these theories .
so what about our fear ?
and recently , i &apos;ve become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story .
i &apos;ve been watching , since i grew up , the expressions of truth and beauty in the arts and truth and beauty in the sciences .
detroit has always been halfway into the future — the advertising half .
now , this idea is extremely controversial , and it &apos;s easy to see why .
( music ) so this is actually how you might separate bikes from cars with minimal cost .
thank you very much .
( applause ) these ideas are very tentative , and that &apos;s in part because this needs to be an inclusive and shared project .
so bring it on , walmart , with 100,000 different products , and amazon , with 27 million books and match.com with — what is it ? — 15 million date possibilities now .
we &apos;ve got laws that fundamentally treat creative works as property , plus massive rewards or settlements in infringement cases , plus huge legal fees to protect yourself in court , plus cognitive biases against perceived loss .
thank you .
this is a pocket of futureless language speakers in northern europe .
we are in effect polluting our children .
its focus on innate racial differences in disease diverts attention and resources from the social determinants that cause appalling racial gaps in health : lack of access to high-quality medical care ; food deserts in poor neighborhoods ; exposure to environmental toxins ; high rates of incarceration ; and experiencing the stress of racial discrimination .
when i went to the training camp i say , &quot; &quot; i want to kill as many muslims , and as many arabs , as possible . &quot; &quot; the training wasn &apos;t easy , but that was the driving force , because i wanted to revenge for my family .
and i said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m going to win the south by southwest weblog award . &quot; &quot; and i won it — i reached all of these people , and i had tens of thousands of people reading about my life every day .
multinationals are protecting human rights .
lots of people find self-transcendence in nature .
and most importantly for this , it &apos;ll tell us why we have language .
through generous support and partnership scientifically with google.org and the skoll foundation , we were able to start the global viral forecasting initiative and begin work in four different sites in africa and asia .
but this idea , that our present and our future are mutually exclusive , that to fulfill our potential for doing we have to surrender our profound potential for being , that the number of transistors on a circuit can be doubled and doubled , but our capacity for compassion and humanity and serenity and love is somehow limited is a false and suffocating choice .
and then , if you &apos;re one of these unsporting characters , you shoot the animals and take them home .
and he spent all this time stuck in the hospital while he was having those procedures , as a result of which he now can walk .
a lot of very handsome and pretty people here , skinny , chubby , different races , cultures . we are all 99.9 % genetically equal .
however , honeybees are a minority .
the khmer rouge closes the doors to the outside world .
let me ask you a few questions to see if this is a good choice . &quot; &quot; then you sell a lot more .
you know i &apos;m bound ; ♫ ♫ i &apos;m bound to thank for it ♫ ♫ la li la li la la la ♫ ♫ la li la la li la li la la la ♫ ( clapping ) ♫ la li la la la ♫ ♫ la li la la la la ♫ ♫ la li la li la la la ♫ ♫ la li la la li la li la la ♫ ♫ and you ♫ ♫ now you &apos;ve been so kind and ... ♫ curb the enthusiasm , just a little bit .
so each window is an image and is a world that i often revisit .
for the hollywood people in the audience , this even explains why action movies have larger budgets than comedies : it &apos;s because action movies translate easier into other languages and other cultures , so the market for those movies is larger .
and that is , &quot; &quot; what type of world do we want to live in , and what decision are we going to make today to ensure that we all live in a sustainable world ? &quot; &quot; ladies and gentlemen , thank you very , very much .
and it &apos;s not sustainable , and the huge logging camps in the forest are now demanding meat , so the pygmy hunters in the congo basin who &apos;ve lived there with their wonderful way of living for so many hundreds of years are now corrupted .
teams kill their ideas as soon as the evidence is on the table because they &apos;re rewarded for it .
what do you think of when i say the word &quot; &quot; design &quot; &quot; ?
i realize this is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food .
and we found that 10 out of the 11 100,000-base pair pieces we synthesized were completely accurate and compatible with a life-forming sequence .
but we ’ re all disciplined by the understanding that the only people who are going to decide , you know , whether i ’ m right or somebody else is right , are the people in our community in the next generation , in 30 and 50 years .
so the human brain , coupled with the human heart , and we join hands around the world .
we go forward to 2007 , not only had the world &apos;s stock of data exploded , but there &apos;d been this massive substitution of digital for analog .
so i don &apos;t want to be patient . and the task i &apos;m giving to you is to not be patient . so i &apos;d like you to actually try , when you go home , to get your data .
and so what does that mean , that it &apos;s biodegradable and biocompatible ?
but when i finish it , i seem to like those ikea pieces of furniture more than i like other ones .
and , very surprisingly , over half of them had , actually , something to do with design .
well , how are we going to think about this ?
that poster is not folded .
but this one &apos;s kind of cool .
what will making myself invisible here cause people to think ?
now , if she &apos;s a servant , there is no way she could afford a pair of pearl earrings .
one , i care that you spell it right .
health services were provided .
if you present with a diseased wind pipe we &apos;d like to take cells from your windpipe .
i know that we &apos;re near the end of this conference , and some of you may be wondering why they have a speaker from the field of religion .
we intuit other people &apos;s feelings ; we know the meaning of their actions even before they happen .
sputnik wasn &apos;t a technical loss , but it was a prestige loss .
move out , because as you change your world , as you change your community , as we believe that we are impacting one girl , one family , one village , one country at a time .
it &apos;s not , and binging is never good .
and i don &apos;t think any of us has a full understanding of it , by any means .
accelerometers on each hand read hand position .
by the way , this is the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit .
now it may seem hard , but mcdonald &apos;s didn &apos;t have salads until the consumer demand was there .

so i was of course very skeptical about this process of just manufacturing romantic love , but of course i was intrigued .
this involves breaking down abilities into component skills , being clear about what subskill we &apos;re working to improve , like keeping our shoulders down , giving full concentration to a high level of challenge outside our comfort zone , just beyond what we can currently do , using frequent feedback with repetition and adjustments , and ideally engaging the guidance of a skilled coach , because activities designed for improvement are domain-specific , and great teachers and coaches know what those activities are and can also give us expert feedback .

i believe movement is the most important function of the brain — don &apos;t let anyone tell you that it &apos;s not true .
we do . as rational as we are , as committed to intellect as we are .
you can pinch into any page .
but are there ways to think about housing trusts or land trusts or a mission-based development that starts to protect some of the space that happens , because when you have 7,500 empty lots in a city , you want something to happen there , but you need entities that are not just interested in the development piece , but entities that are interested in the stabilization piece , and i feel like often the developer piece is really motivated , but the other work of a kind of neighborhood consciousness , that part doesn &apos;t live anymore .
if i really , truly understand what the world looks like from your perspective , i am empathetic .
think of diversity as giving us options .
and these two missions , as you can tell , thread together perfectly . one adds to the other ; in fact , one would be impossible without the other .

it &apos;s like , art is supposed to be enigmatic , so when you say , like , &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t get it , &quot; &quot; like , oh , that &apos;s great . ( laughter ) art does that , because art is about asking questions , questions that may not be answerable .
in the years to come , we &apos;re going to see technological innovations beyond anything i can even envision , but we are very unlikely to see anything even approximating the computational power of a human child in my lifetime or in yours .

here , this cloaked , secret agent virus is slipping his dna into the bacterial cell , but here &apos;s the kicker : it doesn &apos;t do anything harmful — not at first .
but you and i and other innovators , we can see the potential in this next leap in accuracy .

so here &apos;s the million-dollar question for social scientists like me : is the staircase a feature of our evolutionary design ?
and he never expected this .

if we slice into this product which is actually sitting here , you can see that it has a number of cooling channels pass through it , which means it &apos;s a more efficient product .
if we start one of those community plates spinning , that &apos;s really great , that really starts to empower people , but if we can then spin that community plate with the learning plate , and then spin it with the business plate , we &apos;ve got a real show there , we &apos;ve got some action theater .

let &apos;s charge them a boatload of cash for this and see what they think . ( laughter ) br : yeah , so you can imagine , a task like this — this is another one of those assignments that the kitchen staff hated us for . but we really had to almost relearn how to cook in general , because these are ingredients , you know , plant life that we &apos;re , one , unfamiliar with , and two , we have no reference for how to cook these things because people don &apos;t eat them .

because of course they didn &apos;t tell us that they had three station wagons full of drawings , model concepts , pictures — everything i wanted , they &apos;d locked up in the cars , because they had shown solidarity with the engineers — and they &apos;d decided not to show me anything , in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start , because they hadn &apos;t realized , of course , that they couldn &apos;t do problem creating .
another way to look at this is to think of world gdp over the last 10,000 years , i &apos;ve actually taken the trouble to plot this for you in a graph .

he &apos;s very , very thin , and he is , indeed , very sick with pneumonia , and he &apos;s too sick to talk to me , so i talk to his daughter kathleen , and i say to her , &quot; &quot; did you and jim ever talk about what you would want done if he ended up in this kind of situation ? &quot; &quot; and she looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; no , of course not ! &quot; &quot; i thought , &quot; &quot; okay . take this steady . &quot; &quot; and i got talking to her , and after a while , she said to me , &quot; you know , we always thought there &apos;d be time . &quot;

here &apos;s the new project : we &apos;re trying to create the first climbing search-and-rescue robot — no suction or magnets — that can only move on limited kinds of surfaces .
all kinds of possible sentient beings may be interconnected through this system , and i can &apos;t wait to see these experiments unfold .
the rest of it is the bedside console ; just for reference , this is a sleep tracking system from just a few years ago — i mean , really until now .
the lawyers and the judges would travel from one county courthouse to the other , and when anyone was knowing lincoln was in town , they would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories .

millions of people living here , stretched over many kilometers .
( voice over ) woody : what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
how do the rules give rise to the patterns ?
and now we mechanized that process . changing that pattern requires a scope , a scale , a speed of change that is beyond what we have done in the past .
watch what happens when we drop some out .
and you can start iterating the design .
i used to actually hang up on them .
the houses we build do not survive severe earthquakes .
and the answer is , &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .

so , naomi was pivotal in that .
this brain is very much a thinking machine .
you &apos;re doing it for the task itself , for the challenge — and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is — for the thrill of discovery , and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly knit team .

after the war , lots of these songs were lost , but they are a part of our childhood and our history , and we should not forget them . &quot; &quot; improbably , this lgbt singing choir has demonstrated how women are investing in tradition to create change , like alchemists turning discord into harmony .
i go to schools to talk to young , muslim girls so they don &apos;t accept to be married against their will very young .

we always are . we &apos;re always going above the speed limit .
we import 90 percent of our food , and we only cultivate less than one percent of our land .
but what was also interesting was that none of them actually scaled .
and yet , for some reason , if somebody conducts 10 studies but only publishes the five that give the result that they want , we don &apos;t consider that to be research misconduct .

the reason this matters is today , if you go to look at a copy of &quot; &quot; 1984 &quot; &quot; on amazon.com , the nsa can see a record of that , the russian intelligence service can see a record of that , the chinese service can see a record of that , the french service , the german service , the services of andorra .
and these cameras are positioned on rocks on the sides of the glaciers , and they look in on the glacier from permanent , bedrock positions , and they watch the evolution of the landscape .
for many people , this means , i wish i &apos;d spent more time with my family , with my kids when they were growing up .
that means no two people &apos;s milos can be the same .
they &apos;re also now small enough to sit on a desktop .
as i did , so slid the chair .
let &apos;s start by looking at the normal weight people in the study .
so i want to share with you a couple key insights about complexity we &apos;re learning from studying nature that maybe are applicable to other problems .

this is a picture about a year ago .
now as it turns out , the best treatments for ptsd use many of the very same training principles that the military uses in preparing its trainees for war .
so how do we make that actually work ?
and we &apos;ll see what we come up with .
but , in 10 or 15 machine generations they will , and these are machine generations , not human generations .
&#91; &quot; &quot; &apos; gulp &apos; a tour of the human digestive system by mary roach . &quot; &quot; &#93; mary roach is an amazing writer who takes potentially mundane scientific subjects and makes them not mundane at all ; she makes them really fun .

this is our protocell technology , effectively making a shell , like its limestone forefathers , and depositing it in a very complex environment , against natural materials .
as i said , this can be done with only two people , and with a minimum amount of time .
but my biggest ask is this : you see , you &apos;re going to leave here and you &apos;re going to see some astonishing stories in the news .
they say , &quot; &quot; i can &apos;t take it anymore .
over here you can see this is the distribution of power in favor of civilian nuclear energy today , this is what that power block is predicted to be like by the late parts of 2010 , early parts of 2011 .
these changes are detailed in many books .
i study this .
and we &apos;ve got to say , what good is all of our intellectual and political and economic power — and i &apos;m really thinking intellectual power in this room — if we can &apos;t use it to bring slavery to an end ?
here &apos;s what that looks like .
you can play around with it .

and in this meeting — it went on for weeks in the press , two weeks where there was huge discussion .
and i will always come back to this quote from the japanese &quot; &quot; essays in idleness &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; in everything , uniformity is undesirable .

so if one looks at the statements that have been made about this , i am impressed that when hillary clinton described the foreign policy of the obama administration , she said that the foreign policy of the obama administration was going to be smart power , as she put it , &quot; &quot; using all the tools in our foreign policy tool box . &quot; &quot; and if we &apos;re going to deal with these two great power shifts that i &apos;ve described , the power shift represented by transition among states , the power shift represented by diffusion of power away from all states , we &apos;re going to have to develop a new narrative of power
this is my first time at ted . normally , as an advertising man , i actually speak at ted evil , which is ted &apos;s secret sister that pays all the bills .
so we tried something out , and we wrote a message in a piece of silk , which is right here , and the message is over there .
and if we do that , that also means that as we continue to roll out the supply-side technology , we will have less of a job to do if we &apos;ve actually managed to reduce our energy consumption , because we will then need less infrastructure on the supply side .
these machines would think they — these organisms , if they came back to life now — whether they &apos;ve died and gone to heaven , there &apos;s a universe .

i want to hear that song . untie me . &quot; &quot; and the first mate wisely resists and doesn &apos;t untie odysseus .
i believe that what we managed to achieve in fighting corruption , one can also achieve in other areas of failing governance .
so we &apos;re going to need to be careful and take big data and adjust it for our needs , our very human needs .
thankfully , in a few minutes , i saw the signature hive-like rash appear on my legs , which is a side effect of the medication , and i knew i &apos;d be okay .
and , as i &apos;ve been looking , over the last year , for models for how to do that , i &apos;ve been sort of looking across time , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity .
today she &apos;s 41 years old , a mother of three , and she &apos;s a physician saving other lives .
there are truths about two .
this is what was in the newspapers and in the new york times .
i thought , well maybe that &apos;s why we have two eyes , so i kept working .
and even a limited nuclear war involving , say , tens of nuclear weapons , could lead to the end of all life on the planet .
but keep in mind that there &apos;s already a lot of very mature technology out there for surveillance .
now , either we &apos;re all just becoming really grumpy as we get older , or it may mean that as you understand laughter better , and you are getting better at doing that , you need more than just hearing people laugh to want to laugh .
no video here , so you can focus on the sound , the acoustics , of a new kind of trajectory : gaga to water .
that is quite sufficient for most of our conservation applications .
there was no filter .
sometimes you keep the time up , because the time gives you detail .
except for the threat of bio-terrorism , they &apos;re very simple issues in terms of , can we design things to produce clean energy , perhaps revolutionizing what developing countries can do and provide through various simple processes .
and we take those key concepts and they sort of form this mathematical structure of an idea .
it &apos;s just a curve without inflection .
when you meet someone here at ted — and this is the top networking place , of course , of the year — you don &apos;t shake somebody &apos;s hand and then say , &quot; &quot; can you hold on for a moment while i take out my phone and google you ? &quot; &quot; or when you go to the supermarket and you &apos;re standing there in that huge aisle of different types of toilet papers , you don &apos;t take out your cell phone , and open a browser , and go to a website to try to decide which of these different toilet papers is the most ecologically responsible purchase to make .
well , for your record , my opinion of the legalization , i &apos;d say i &apos;m against it .
but movement , ultimately , only has a meaning if you have a home to go back to .
i said , &quot; &quot; not to worry .
we have got to make sure that we can move our economies forward , and also our societies , based on the idea that people can really feel mathematics .
how many of you here love surprises ? say , &quot; &quot; aye . &quot; &quot; audience : aye .
the worms are growing inches per week !
the good people at forbes magazine , among my biggest admirers , called it &quot; &quot; nick hanauer &apos;s near-insane proposal . &quot; &quot; and yet , just 350 days after that article was published , seattle &apos;s mayor ed murray signed into law an ordinance raising the minimum wage in seattle to 15 dollars an hour , more than double what the prevailing federal $ 7.25 rate is .
they decided this wasn &apos;t good enough and they wanted to get it up to 99 .

this kind of approach is kind of the way some students approach preparing for standardized tests .
well , there are , of course , a number of reasons , but perhaps the primary reason is because we &apos;re still organized as a species in the same way that we were organized 200 or 300 years ago .
and he sets an example of the concerned scientist .
people get mad at the mayor . so how &apos;s the traffic tonight ?
the average age of gamers ?

( applause ) matt ridley : thank you , cynthia .
we exist in a world governed by quantum physics , a universe of zero and one both at the same time , a reality based on infinite probabilities and shades of gray .
so this is interesting in the sense that you can now do &quot; &quot; if-then-for &quot; &quot; statements in materials , in structure .
wouldn &apos;t that be enough ? and then the children would get plenty of support , and nurturing , and mentoring , and the world population would decline very rapidly and everybody would be totally happy .
it &apos;s got nothing to do with inflation .
i think we &apos;d all agree that children are the most important people in the world and the most vulnerable .

here the key idea is that the robots are agnostic to the identities of their neighbors .
and the earhole isn &apos;t doing it to me at all .
i flew here yesterday .
jee gets to have his project ; the public gets a sweeter environment ; and different public gets a place to express itself ; and the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads .
and it turns out this model is everywhere , once you start looking for it .
we were brought out in the hall when i was a little kid and taught how to put our coats over our heads to protect us from global thermonuclear war .
are they going to create a world where there is really an inclusive work force ?
cisplatin is a relatively common ovarian cancer chemotherapy drug — a relatively simple molecule made in the lab that messes with the dna of cancer cells and causes them to kill themselves .
but let &apos;s not kid ourselves .
we are not alone ; the animals are moving in .
and in fact , nobody really exactly understands all the things it &apos;s being used for right now .
it was just as critical for me to be the first person in at a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers to juice my multiple devices .
the gray boxes that you see , these are real-time control systems .
( applause ) for me it is clear that all societies will be multiethnic , multicultural , multi-religious in the future .

kids prosper best with a broad curriculum that celebrates their various talents , not just a small range of them .
they have 66 schools — mostly middle schools , some high schools — and what goes on is great teaching .
and i began to realize that there are different ways of doing diplomacy — that diplomacy , like business , is a business of solving problems , and yet the word innovation doesn &apos;t exist in diplomacy ; it &apos;s all zero sum games and realpolitik and ancient institutions that have been there for generations and do things the same way they &apos;ve always done things .
recount all the different ways that you engaged the systems of government , of the marketplace , of social institutions , of faith organizations , of the media .

the philosopher arthur schopenhauer said that those who don &apos;t wonder about the contingency of their existence , of the contingency of the world &apos;s existence , are mentally deficient .
why in the heck in america are we doing a census in 2010 ?
it &apos;s not very good . it &apos;s cluttered .
the last century , 1870 , was bad for the kids in europe , because most of this statistics is europe .
think about what happened , after all , to the poor frog .
and the friends &apos; names each have a connotation in japanese to a color .
i &apos;m not sure i really even want it to .
here we go . ( laughter ) this little baby has a lot of horsepower .
i mean , we transferred ownership and they had a big party and blew up the entire building .
i started as an apprentice to a hungarian craftsman , and this taught me what the guild system was in middle ages .
maybe we are among the first generation that really understands this digital curating of ourselves .
oh , this is a little pony , little pony — very cute little thing .
similarly , when you put motor output on movement output , it &apos;s extremely noisy .
also , there &apos;s numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolizing methane .
what matters here isn &apos;t technical capital , it &apos;s social capital .
i presented this to the jet propulsion lab at nasa , and they said that they had no ability to go down craters to look for ice , and life , ultimately , on mars . and he said — especially with legged-robots , because they &apos;re way too complicated .
yes , put that aside .
there is one battle that illustrates that .
and so we are going to use molecules and refashion this thing , rebuild everything from the bottom up , using dna in ways that nature never intended , using dna origami , and dna origami to seed this algorithmic self-assembly .
and lastly , i will wrap up with one minute of art tatum .
the thermostat is set at 100 degrees , and the other areas of the brain , involved in drive and motivation , are shut down .
and all you have to do is look at the very grim death count in the 20th century alone , of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands , you know ?
cities and density mean that our buildings are going to continue to be big , and i think there &apos;s a role for wood to play in cities .
it spreads out to be really thin , so you have a hard time corralling it .
and each of us knew that when we left the spinal ward we would never be the same .
it has to be different from the buildings there .
esther perel : it &apos;s interesting , because on the one hand , the need for love is ubiquitous and universal .
ivan comes back and he says , &quot; &quot; i want my cheese sandwich . &quot; &quot; so which one do you think ivan is going to take ?
but is nature ideal ?
please raise your hand high right now . ok .
the main characteristics of such a system is that there &apos;s one sole contact point to the ground .
dr : john kamen — who &apos;s here , actually — put together a two and a half minute piece that shows the platform in use .
he &apos;s been a soldier , a teacher , a politician , a vice-mayor and a business man .
we got madd chadd , lil &apos; c , kid david and j smooth .
and i say , what is the light bulb good for ?
and if you &apos;re in canada , because of the cold winters here in b.c. , there &apos;s about 720 , 730 different types of spiders and there &apos;s one — one — that is venomous , and its venom isn &apos;t even fatal , it &apos;s just kind of like a nasty sting .
actually as was pointed out earlier , we forget about all the struggle there was in getting there .
and so to tune into the clouds is to slow down , to calm down .
help us tell the story .
i would fiddle around with microscopes and electromagnets , and i would read about the forces of the small and about quantum mechanics and i would marvel at how well that description matched up to our observation .
when i became president in 1993 , there were none of these organizations in russia .
but the conversation they &apos;re having now — about what their good society should look like , what their excellent society should look like , is a really good thing .
we haven &apos;t yet found a way to kill this project .
so , let &apos;s roll the video .
and it really was . it was the original microprocessor .
and if i haven &apos;t revealed my prejudices already , i think that life has been about molecular computers building electrochemical computers , building electronic computers , which together with electrochemical computers will build new molecular computers , which will build new electronic computers , and so forth .
the wind map , by wattenberg and fernanda viégas , i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve ever seen it — it &apos;s really fantastic .
( music ) yeah , that was very short , but you could see it &apos;s a completely different figure . right ?
he told me , &quot; &quot; he &apos;s at school . he &apos;d doing quite well . &quot; &quot; but i understood he wanted to tell me something .
you know , we &apos;ve seen that — we &apos;ve got things on hypertext on cd-roms .
( laughter ) now you have no excuse . it &apos;s almost lunchtime , and this is not a standing ovation , so don &apos;t worry , i &apos;m not fishing for compliments .
okay , so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect .
this one does not have those bells and whistles , but for pure functionality it &apos;s pretty much the best — the neorest 600 .
now i wouldn &apos;t necessarily ask for more stressful experiences in my life , but this science has given me a whole new appreciation for stress .
this is a trick .
ms : i did . the very first picture is a picture of my family .
so my second insight is that , when we take the turing test for poetry , we &apos;re not really testing the capacity of the computers because poetry-generating algorithms , they &apos;re pretty simple and have existed , more or less , since the 1950s .
the notion of the narrowly focused life is highly romanticized in our culture .
and it &apos;s an amazing technology because not only does it combat climate change , but it &apos;s an innovation .
it &apos;s a lot .
we circle around flags , and then we can trust each other .
maybe july , maybe june .
i had to meet my prime minister .
i &apos;m saying we are homo duplex and this staircase takes us up from the profane level to the level of the sacred .
they do not say , &quot; &quot; i want better hot water in the showers .
so i think at every stage , you know — there &apos;s that metaphor , there &apos;s turtles all the way .
so , we decided that what we like to do is take just a bit of that mammary gland , which is called an &quot; &quot; acinus , &quot; &quot; where there are all these little things inside the breast where the milk goes , and the end of the nipple comes through that little tube when the baby sucks .
the clock experience should be profound , but from the outside it should be invisible .
ooh . in a couple of hours &apos; time i &apos;m going to get in here and do my swim .
the terror is incomprehensible to most of us , because blindness is thought to epitomize ignorance and unawareness , hapless exposure to the ravages of the dark unknown .
( laughter ) so , my urging , my thought , is that the internet isn &apos;t just a pile of information .
( music ) so , this is remix , right ?
well , the answer is yes .
they &apos;re beautiful . they &apos;re bamboo .
we were going to do things better .
if you put a child in a car seat , 18.2 percent of the children die .
what if we were to say , no more hard rock mining ?
so not just honey , most of the monkeys went with guys who had more .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
because people like me took your job .
more recently , i wrote an article for esquire called — about radical honesty .
it ’ s also the biggest risk factor for glaucoma , which is just alzheimer ’ s disease of the eye .
part of that health includes an outstanding education .
i am buckling in seatbelts from the front .
so you see how transformative little bits of help can be .
but we &apos;re facing a stark dilemma where some cities are going to thrive and drive global growth and others are going to stumble and pull it backwards .
if we do nothing to stop the problem , all of egypt &apos;s sites will be affected by looting by 2040 .
off the bed .
in a sense , the room itself is the elephant in the room , but we don &apos;t see it . and we &apos;ve become victims of a system that points us elsewhere . consider this .
and these include a sense of shared responsibility , common norms that bind people together as a community .
everywhere in public services — in companies , in the way we work , the way we innovate , invest — try to learn to work better .
stop running around starving .
and these things don &apos;t stay in the center of gravity , but over time , they gravitate there .
this looks like a plant , but it &apos;s actually an animal .
hamas party member : we were in complete harmony , and we wanted to spread it to all of palestine .
should we do serious research on this topic ?
we &apos;re understanding the software programs that make our body run .
actually , linus didn &apos;t look at them that carefully .
he was under the impression that i had a mild psychotic illness .
we &apos;re all specialists now , even the primary care physicians .
it &apos;s time to stop building the shopping malls , the prisons , the stadiums and other tributes to all of our collective failures .
and this is where the guatemalan military trains peacekeepers from other countries , the ones that serve with the u.n.
at that stage i just wanted to abandon the research , but — ( laughter ) — it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that .
i &apos;m a cybersecurity researcher , which means my job is to sit down with this information and try to make sense of it , to try to understand what all the ones and zeroes mean .
don &apos;t let them hook &#91; up &#93; with the chinese cats .
and so in fact , in some individuals with autism , it is genetic !
if you don &apos;t design your life , someone else will design it for you , and you may just not like their idea of balance .
so this is what happened on this movie , and that &apos;s how it got made , and we went to this very nice postproduction company in montreal called vision globale , and they lent their 60 artists to work full time for six months to do this crazy film .
i did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other olive oils .

and we really appreciate that . and we &apos;re buying you lunch today .
loud stops being loud anymore , after a while .
i &apos;m actually here to make a challenge to people .
and the squabble went on and on , and kollek listened and listened , and he finally said , &quot; &quot; gentlemen , spare me your sermons , and i will fix your sewers . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) that &apos;s what mayors do .
de : jonathan is able to translate this complicated pattern of vibrations into an understanding of what &apos;s being said .
do you believe , and can you tell us why , there is going to be a significant shift in things like violence and peace and conflict and resolution on a sustainable basis ?

bg : well , we decided that we &apos;d pick two causes , whatever the biggest inequity was globally , and there we looked at children dying , children not having enough nutrition to ever develop , and countries that were really stuck , because with that level of death , and parents would have so many kids that they &apos;d get huge population growth , and that the kids were so sick that they really couldn &apos;t be educated and lift themselves up .

and of course we &apos;re seeing that exponential growth happen .
just as fish swim and birds fly , people form tribes . it &apos;s just what we do .
well , today , i want to challenge that theory .
and in lebanon , southern lebanon in &apos; 82 , he said to himself and to everybody else , i will never use the word &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; again .
so , that clearly wasn &apos;t going to work .
so our sons are going to have to find some way of adapting to this , some new relationship with each other , and i think we really have to show them , and model for them , how a real man is someone who trusts his sisters and respects them , and wants to be on their team , and stands up against the real bad guys , who are the men who want to abuse the women .

this is the phrase that i &apos;ve used in some stuff which i &apos;ve done with a think tank in london called demos , where we &apos;ve been looking at these people who are amateurs — i.e. , they do it for the love of it — but they want to do it to very high standards .
instead , all the major threats facing us today are problems entirely of our own making . and since we made the problems , we can also solve the problems . that then means that it &apos;s entirely in our power to deal with these problems .
there are scavenger beetles that pick the skin and flesh off of bones in museums .

so the first time she realizes that wonder woman isn &apos;t coming , i &apos;ll make sure she knows she doesn &apos;t have to wear the cape all by herself , because no matter how wide you stretch your fingers , your hands will always be too small to catch all the pain you want to heal .

it only has to solve one little problem .

an entrepreneur doesn &apos;t expect a regular paycheck .
if you &apos;re up the scale a little bit more , why , a brass thali .
but the problem is that things — in the upper-right corner there — personalized data , it &apos;s been pretty hard to come by .
( laughter ) okay . so now the titanic transition .
but in at least a large class of cases , one can think of the universe as being like some kind of network , which , when it gets big enough , behaves like continuous space in much the same way as having lots of molecules can behave like a continuous fluid .
online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen .
trying to start an artificial genetic system running in the computer .

at the end of that you &apos;re completely fried , your brain .
normal technology or innovation happens like this : somebody has an interesting idea , some other scientist or engineer , they take it to the next level , they make a theory about it and maybe they patent it , and then some industry will make a contract of exclusivity to manufacture and sell it , and then , eventually , a buyer will buy it , and we hope that they are going to use &#91; it &#93; for a good purpose .
it hasn &apos;t changed as we were growing up .
i &apos;m @ falkvinge on twitter .

and i can tell you this happens , because it happened to me .
next year i &apos;ll be leading an international team to j2 .
dinosaurs was one of them .
if we want to better understand and decode diseases like cancer , we need to stop treating them as acute , isolated episodes , and consider and measure everything that affects our health on a permanent basis .
and that &apos;s green . if you look from the tower — this is when we start attacking the grass .
and it completely threw science on its head .
grab my wrist , but squeeze , squeeze firm .
well , lots of people have understandable fears about trafficking .
and as it turns out , the older you get , the less likely you are to divorce .

it is very easy to think that networks are necessarily good things — that being linked from one place to another , that being tightly linked in a group , is a very good thing .
i centered my instruction on the lives , histories and identities of my students .
and that &apos;s what that moment with patricia schroeder i think shows : that if we are to bring about an end to the world &apos;s worst atrocities , we have to make it such .
it used to be that you had to go to a classroom , and there would be some diligent teacher — some genius teacher in there — but that person was only in there at certain times and you had to go then , and then was not most times .

i mean , if you can think how important — if you have a gps system and there are no satellites , it &apos;s not going to be much use . but , like — but , you know , if somebody had a gps system in the 17th century some king would have gotten together an army and gone to get it , you know . if that person — audience : for the teddy bear ? the teddy bear ?

just to be clear , i think computers can really help with this problem , actually make it more conceptual .
so i just picked one of the things that i thought i learned — in this case , &quot; &quot; everything i do always comes back to me &quot; &quot; — and we made these spreads right out of this .
we do a lot of work in biomedical fields .
and so there &apos;s companies like face.com that now have about 18 billion faces online .
anyway , johnny had just gotten through having sex with her .
fred jansen : you mentioned halfway through that the technology to actually look at the spectrum of an exoplanet like earth is not there yet .
every research direction that i tried led to a dead end .
he gave entertainment , pleasure and relief to so many human beings when they needed it the most .
this is a substantially large impact .
this is how long &quot; &quot; the simpsons &quot; &quot; has been on television .
so it has been a long journey .
so in some ways , they become a technological institution that has a lot of the benefits of the traditional institutions we &apos;re used to using in society , but it does this in a decentralized way .
but now we needed to get brad &apos;s performance to drive our virtual benjamin .
all you do is connect to the bristles , and the bristles are wet , so they conduct , and the person &apos;s body conducts , and leather is great to paint on , and then you can start hooking to everything , even the kitchen sink .

in literary criticism and analysis , probably 40 or 50 years ago , literary critics were a kind of cultural hero ; now they &apos;re kind of a national joke .
so it &apos;s not far-fetched to say that , at some point , online video is going to dramatically accelerate scientific advance .
but when women in some regions of south and central america are advised not to get pregnant for two years — that &apos;s something new , that ought to get our attention .
in this case , at the end of the bypass operation , you &apos;re going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure being injected directly into the heart of the patient .

i &apos;ve been to a lot of lectures where , at the end of it , inevitably , one of the first questions that comes up is , &quot; &quot; but , but what can i do ?
it sounds like an infection , at best .
scientists think now our magnetic field may be diminished by about five percent .
we have a bunch of legos . so , as i said , this is a playground for adults , where they sit down and try to play with different shapes and different designs .
nathaniel kahn : if he did he was a very lucky man .

turbo &apos;s never been fed .
but in fact , here in the northwest , we &apos;re living very close to the real koranic idea of paradise , defined 36 times as &quot; &quot; gardens watered by running streams . &quot; &quot; since i live on a houseboat on the running stream of lake union , this makes perfect sense to me .

we don &apos;t have to stay stuck in old ideas about prison .
and very few of them control for the possibility that parents pass on genes for — that increase the chances a child will be articulate or violent and so on .
you can look at how much electricity they need , because you need a certain amount of electricity to run the servers , and google is more efficient than most , but they still have some basic requirements , and that lets you put a limit on the number of servers that they have .
the least you could expect is good tv , right ?
so genomics , proteomics , the environment , all this data streaming at us individually and us , as poor physicians , how do we manage it ?
so this is change happening .
her sons , one of whom had asthma , were no longer as sick as they used to be .
i &apos;m telling you this one .
well , as with anything in biology , nothing really makes sense except in the light of evolution .
where is the danger going to exist ?
and minimizing friction turns out to be the decisive variable .
i think this is an extraordinary example of how curiosity-based research — we just wondered how they climbed up something — can lead to things that you could never imagine .
thanks very much .
you can see the computer characters on the right are having the same complex motion as the dancers .
( laughter ) knowing your country to be economical conducive for investment , and your people as transparent and trustworthy to engage in business , on which premise i write you . ( laughter )
let &apos;s start by asking : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
but what we &apos;re going to be talking about here tonight are experiments done on this sort of non-living end of this spectrum — so actually doing chemical experiments in the laboratory , mixing together nonliving ingredients to make new structures , and that these new structures might have some of the characteristics of living systems .
you &apos;re going to be okay . you &apos;re going to live .
make sure to write the terrorist &apos;s name in the caption , make sure to name the picture file &quot; &quot; breivik.jpeg. &quot; &quot; let &apos;s teach google that that &apos;s the face of the terrorist . &quot; &quot; and it worked .
it was the brainchild of the u.s. state department .
if we &apos;re taught as leaders to just manage what we can measure , and all we can measure is the tangible in life , we &apos;re missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid .
i may fall , but i do not die , for that which is real in me goes forward and lives on in the comrades for whom i gave up my life .
we will see the further evolution of this kind of business-class morality .
it is a live carpet .
this can happen , and the outcome could be very good for humanity .
the reason is , this isn &apos;t how people do odds .
and , of course , of course , we tackled the big stuff , like rehauling the entire school budget so that we can reallocate funds to have more teachers and support staff .
teaching a computer to read these facial emotions is hard , because these action units , they can be fast , they &apos;re subtle , and they combine in many different ways .
so what we need to recognize is that if we want to have a citizen-centric internet in the future , we need a broader and more sustained internet freedom movement .
we were a lower middle class family , but that &apos;s of course not real poverty .
so i &apos;m happy she &apos;s here .

we may see the eradication of polio this year .
areas with a lot of economic activity — with a lot of roads , with a lot of urbanization — those areas have higher prevalence than others .
took a few photos . i got my satellite phone out .
what it is , it &apos;s a landscape that is an intentional one .
i was very happy with it ; so was chern .
well , the same things happen to our cells .
and the fundamental idea is you want to plan your movements so as to minimize the negative consequence of the noise .
of course , when you give them clothes , when you give them tools , you also give them diseases .
( laughter ) well , the topic i &apos;m going to discuss is one which is , in a certain sense , very peculiar because it &apos;s very old .
families need the help .
he said , &quot; &quot; why haven &apos;t you been returning my calls ? &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; well , they say that you &apos;re a psychopath . &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m not a psychopath . &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; you know what ?
and the picture is that the whole universe — and that doesn &apos;t mean just space , it means me as well , and inside you — the whole universe is full of something called a higgs field .
in 1986 , i truly understood the notion of story having a theme .
so you have these physical objects that represent police , fire and rescue , and a dispatcher can grab them and place them on the map to tell those units where to go , and then the position of the units on the map gets synced up with the position of those units in the real world .
she loved her husband , it was the sweetest thing .

she never liked it very much .
it will appear , certainly , in many more middle eastern stories .
nowhere in the world , for example , do women have equal representation in positions of power .
eventually , it will be able to have to stay up day , night , day , night , for six months at a time , acting like the synchronous satellite , but only ten miles above the earth .

and i operated the mechanical brooms and i plowed the snow .
because it remains hard work for women to wash .
most of the time is kind of sitting there .
so , this clip is from the pbs series , &quot; &quot; the secret life of the brain . &quot; &quot; it shows you these cells that process information .
thank you .
things in life start out being general cell , and they become specialized : you have tissue cells , you have muscle , brain cells . and same things happens with say , a hammer , which is general at first and becomes more specific .
one last example from this data : sometimes it &apos;s actually a piece of content that is special .
well , then the country has less available for other services , like roads , schools , healthcare .
but the difference in accepting this particular defeat is that sometimes , if cancer has won , if there &apos;s death and we have no choice , then grace and acceptance are necessary .
some shut down the self using meditation .
they wouldn &apos;t have me .
there were a lot of girls there as well , so i was utterly mortified .
on a manual typewriter it was very difficult , and even when we had electric typewriters , or then computer keyboards , the fact is that even if you can type easily enough to keep up with the pace of speech , more or less , you have to have somebody who can receive your message quickly .
i became obsessed with how it might be that we &apos;re embedded in these social networks , and how they affect our lives .
this entire collection , wanderers , that was named after planets , was not to me really about fashion per se , but it provided an opportunity to speculate about the future of our race on our planet and beyond , to combine scientific insight with lots of mystery and to move away from the age of the machine to a new age of symbiosis between our bodies , the microorganisms that we inhabit , our products and even our buildings .
&#91; @ justinesacco has in fact landed at cape town international .
early versions of the fluid were actually used on a cray supercomputer .
and that tension , that discovery , that push for something new — and at the same time , that sense of obligation to the regards of craftsmanship — that &apos;s as strong in cars as it is in anything .
a gentleman named lebron james came up and he took a three to tie .
and when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach , where there was a clear distinction between the private sphere and the public sphere .
and that to me , spoke volumes , because it &apos;s — the film started about a true-life story about a woman who was harassed , sued her employer , led to a landmark case that led to the equal opportunity act , and the violence against women act and others .
you can run this simulation in real time , in front of your eyes , change it , if you want to , and you get the animation straight out of it .
it &apos;s not to do with electricity or water .
we &apos;ve seen people , even today , speaking to us about aids epidemics and starving kids around the world and impure water supplies that people have to suffer with .
at this event , we spoke about the different technologies directed at cancer .
public agenda did a survey for us a couple of years ago where they found that 43 percent of the high school teachers in america say that they spend at least half of their time maintaining order in the classroom .
i contracted a brain infection .
most parents would find that great .
when that comes to an end we &apos;ll go to the sixth paradigm ; three-dimensional self-organizing molecular circuits .
i spent two nights in the hospital recovering from trauma and injuries .
one simple answer is china has shanghai and india has mumbai .
you &#91; probably won &apos;t &#93; randomly draw three blue balls in a row out of a box of mostly yellow balls .

( applause ) the next section here , i &apos;m going to just blast through this , because we could do a whole tedtalk on the next several slides .
but look at the number of black lines in that spectrum .
she lifted her head up , and i saw her face , said hello , and then i immediately noticed something across the bridge of her nose , a crease in her skin .
i admitted that i &apos;d actually had a fantasy — kind of a dark fantasy — of writing a letter about everything that was wrong with the world and then lighting myself on fire on the white house steps .
i became captivated by the beauty and genius of traditional social science experiments done by jane jacobs , stanley milgram , kevin lynch .
if we want to understand the specific characteristics of women who have pms , we need to be able to compare them to women who don &apos;t have pms .
and the best part about it is they snap together with magnets .
they used to say the pen is mightier than the sword . i think the camera is .
these troubles are sometimes misdiagnosed as the end of innovation , but they are actually the growing pains of what andrew mcafee and i call the new machine age .
and it was : we found out that she had stage iv breast cancer , cancer that by then had spread to her lungs , her bones , and her brain .
( laughter ) mm-hm . ( laughter ) so with all of this diversity in structure , one might think , then , that penises are fitting neatly into vaginas all over the place for the purposes of successful reproduction .
&#91; &quot; &quot; this scares the hell out of me ... what if they could do that easily in humans in a couple of years ? ! oh my god we &apos;re doomed &quot; &quot; &#93; xl : indeed , if we take a look at the second one , i think we can all agree that it &apos;s , meh , probably not as positive .
we need to delve into this mass of anatomy that we &apos;ve been compiling to understand where the changes are occurring and what this means .
why ? because we cannot ignore the metaphorical meaning of words either .
they seem to come from the outside , and to mimic perception .
and then after that , you can take it off on assignments .
i &apos;ve never made it into a planet , but that &apos;s it .
you only hear the low frequencies .
this picture doesn &apos;t exactly show the plastics that i would like it to show , because i haven &apos;t been out there myself .

there were smaller billy possums on a stick that kids could wave around like flags .
our challenge is to wake up each day and say , &quot; how can i experience the world better ? &quot;

we &apos;re going down to the cellular level these days .
i love public art .
bush meat is one of the central crises , which is occurring in our population right now , in humanity , on this planet .
if you look at this building in chile , it &apos;s ripped in half , but it &apos;s not a pile of rubble .
and this was one of those cases that went on and on .
and it &apos;s got tiny little particles of metal in it , which makes it magnetic .
we only knew about the return of the jews and the decree of cyrus from the hebrew scriptures .
how come you don &apos;t give him this ?
unfortunately , this doesn &apos;t seem to be true of someone who listened to the music of mozart almost every day , mozart himself , who suffered from gonorrhea , smallpox , arthritis , and , what most people think eventually killed him in the end , syphilis .
ca : go ahead . i &apos;m going to stay right here though .
well , we collect data from satellites , from airplanes , from ground vehicles , from people .
but all that was about to change .
there &apos;s a marker line called the trim line above our little red illustration there .
we designed it to listen for tumor invasion : the orchestra of chemical signals that tumors need to make to spread .
thank you .
and then , when she had to transport all of the embroidery goods from the village to the marketplace , she needed someone to help her do the transport , so she hired her husband .
you could jump off the end into the deep end .
and suddenly , the kids have connected laptops .
i can &apos;t move my body to the beat , and after a scientist who became a philosopher , i have to talk about hard science .
i took a stand , paid half a grand !
and one of the things that i experimented with is this thing called google share which is basically , you take an abstract term , and you search google for that term , and then you search the results that you get back for somebody &apos;s name .
but one other extremely unique thing about bats is that they are able to use sound to perceive their environment . they use echolocation .
in fact , the united nations estimates that there &apos;s about 85 billion pounds a year of electronics waste that gets discarded around the world each and every year — and that &apos;s one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream .
but in india , only 12 percent of girls and women have access to hygienic ways of managing their periods .
and if we &apos;re to make progress with the sustainability revolution , i believe there are three really big changes we need to bring about .
so , they &apos;re all floating around in solution , and to look at them , you have to get them on a surface where they stick .
occasionally , i have hallucinations , like one time i turned around and saw a man with a raised knife .
it &apos;s something that protects us from harm , from hucksters , from people that would try to hoodwink us into a clinical study that we don &apos;t understand , or that we don &apos;t agree to .
and you &apos;d feel so much better , you know .
for that brief moment in time , the glow was brighter than all the stars in all the galaxies in all of the known universe .
one more subject . genetically engineered food crops , in my view , as a biologist , have no reason to be controversial .
the first embrace is something that we think , &quot; &quot; oh , this is very easy , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s actually getting harder , and that &apos;s paying attention to the world around us .
and so i had to start studying , who is it that &apos;s making these decisions ?
now , for the last 10 years , i went around the world meeting economists , scientists , neuroscientists , environmentalists , philosophers , thinkers in the himalayas , all over the place .

he &apos;s out of time .
let me tell you just one or two stories that deal with massive bubbles .
it turned out the cell that we were trying to transplant into had a nuclease , an enzyme that chews up dna on its surface , and was happy to eat the synthetic dna that we gave it and never got transplantations .
so after a while , we could take that out , use it as a lightweight building block .
now a lot of robotics is very impressive , but manipulation robotics is really just in the dark ages .
but tonight , i &apos;ve got some notes here so that if i begin to forget , which i do sometimes , i &apos;ve got something i can turn to .
it was a lot of anger , insane humor , a lot of attention , outrage .
it &apos;s a very significant problem .
i chose the first .
if you look at science on one hand , science is a very rational approach to its surroundings , whereas art on the other hand is usually an emotional approach to its surroundings .
it is a picture that in my wildest dreams i could never have imagined when i was 18 and figuring out that i was gay and feeling estranged from my country and my dreams because of it .

he says , &quot; &quot; you know , look , i know you think this is repugnant , but it is no different from interpreting an ancient text or looking at a monument . &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; they are scientific investigations with real intellectual value . &quot; &quot; proust is trying to show us that jealousy feels intolerable and makes us look absurd , but it is , at its crux , a quest for knowledge , a quest for truth , painful truth , and actually , where proust is concerned , the more painful the truth , the better .
he says , if you &apos;re trying to solve a really hard problem , really hard , that you should have a diverse group of people , including those with diverse intellects .
now , the last thing that i want to talk to you about is care customization , because if you &apos;ve got care anywhere and you &apos;ve got care networking , those are going to go a long way towards improving our health care system , but there &apos;s still too much guesswork .
because brains are expensive .
and you open the box and you &apos;re like , wow , there &apos;s my goo .
so they have invested all their money into there , and the blue bar , class size , is driving costs up .
two black holes , the densest thing in the universe , one with a mass of 29 suns and one with a mass of 36 suns , whirling around each other 100 times per second before they collide .

we see an exponential curve for wind installations now .
it &apos;s what i now have the privilege of saying to twentysomethings like emma every single day : thirty is not the new 20 , so claim your adulthood , get some identity capital , use your weak ties , pick your family .
my self-confidence can be measured out in teaspoons mixed into my poetry , and it still always tastes funny in my mouth .

steaming piles of humus .
the longest continuous amount of time that any human has spent in space is in the vicinity of 12 to 14 months .

and sometimes war is inevitable , sometimes , but maybe &#91; with &#93; effort , we can avoid it .

i don &apos;t know why my wife says i never listen to her . i don &apos;t get that .

jesse owens , on the other hand , ran on cinders , the ash from burnt wood , and that soft surface stole far more energy from his legs as he ran .
they keep doing it ; they just keep making these things .
and i think if we phrase that lesson , it &apos;s something like this : don &apos;t assume that what we currently think is out there is the full story .
tidy boots is very fussy about his footwear .
it &apos;s incredibly hard to clean up .
so the ball may get smarter and smarter and smarter , but i believe it &apos;s still on us to make the decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary , on the right end of the curve .

people have said i was brave to undergo the bone marrow harvest , but i don &apos;t think so .
the question that we had is how can bacteria , these primitive organisms , tell the difference from times when they &apos;re alone , and times when they &apos;re in a community , and then all do something together .

this is a disorder that retards mental development in the child and causes permanent mental impairments .

zack bazzi : do i really want to go ? probably not .
it is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency .
a land where every field hides a grave , where millions of people have been deported or killed in the 20th century .

so , we can see the stars and the planets , but we can &apos;t see what holds them apart or what draws them together .
which is why i &apos;ll show you a threat , and an architectural response .
but if we think about this now and we think about it in the human context on a day like halloween , if parents can in essence costume their children genetically , are we going to be talking about a frankenstein 2.0 kind of situation ?
it &apos;s good for improving people &apos;s lives .
i was a mediocre student .
that for many of them , it has been a life-altering experience .

the difference was , orville and wilbur were driven by a cause , by a purpose , by a belief .
i won &apos;t go into this very much , but our technology , besides being able to tag tumor and metastatic lymph nodes with fluorescence , we can also use the same smart three-part molecule to tag gadolinium onto the system so you can do this noninvasively .
where are we going to start digging ?
it doesn &apos;t matter , it &apos;s spam .

would you believe , 12 pages , single space , the patient has to read before they &apos;re in our trial to cure their epilepsy ?
so firstly , thinking just about precognition , as it turns out , just last year a researcher called daryl bem conducted a piece of research where he found evidence of precognitive powers in undergraduate students , and this was published in a peer-reviewed academic journal and most of the people who read this just said , &quot; &quot; okay , well , fair enough , but i think that &apos;s a fluke , that &apos;s a freak , because i know that if i did a study where i found no evidence that undergraduate students had precognitive powers , it probably wouldn &apos;t get published in a journal .
i lost my faith in our species .
and then the next step is our experiences .
what i actually said , in response to a question about , would you entertain any discussions of mitigating action against snowden , i said , yeah , it &apos;s worth a conversation .

why is it that extremist organizations , whether of the far-right or of the islamist extremism — islamism meaning those who wish to impose one version of islam over the rest of society — why is it that they are succeeding in organizing in a globalized way , whereas those who aspire to democratic culture are falling behind ?
we have one person — well , actually we &apos;re going to slice him in half because it &apos;s less than one percent .
since we know people want to be happy , maybe when our minds wander , they &apos;re going to someplace happier than the place that they &apos;re leaving . it would make a lot of sense .

it used punch cards , which were being fed in , and it ran about 10,000 times slower the first zx81 .
whether i see it in a tweet , in a news headline or the glossy pages of a conservation brochure , that phrase bothers me , because we as conservationists have been sounding the alarms about the death of coral reefs for decades .
it &apos;s because there &apos;s somebody there called foreign aid , who contributes for it .
the first is , technological progress is what allows us to continue this amazing recent run that we &apos;re on where output goes up over time , while at the same time , prices go down , and volume and quality just continue to explode .

( laughter ) but i think this is a wonderful reminder as well , that , actually , the world is in flux .
the beijing olympics were an exercise in chinese soft power .
okay ? oil droplet forms through self-assembly , has a chemical metabolism inside so it can use energy , and it uses that energy to move itself around in its environment .
( camera click ) ( laughter ) so , that &apos;s because the camera needs time to calculate the focus and exposure , but if you pre-focus with a half-press , leave your finger down — no shutter lag !
everything about flying in those years , which was — you have to stop and think for a moment — was probably the most advanced technological thing going on at the time .
detaining someone was used only as a last resort .
they &apos;re like the fedex guys .
and i think that &apos;s one of the main problems of our society .
the telling of stories , music , dance , poetry — found in all cultures , and many of the motifs and themes that give us pleasure in the arts can be found in all human societies : a preference for symmetrical forms , the use of repetition and variation , even things as specific as the fact that in poetry all over the world , you have lines that are very close to three seconds long , separated by pauses .
two , it &apos;s easier to be authentic if you don &apos;t say you &apos;re authentic .

polymers are chains of atoms arranged in long , thin lines .
and i doubt anybody in this room could really hold their breath for 3.5 minutes .
and we &apos;ve spent a lot of time in the field . it &apos;s been a fantastic amount of work .
after decades of 2 percent , we are now at 5 percent , and it &apos;s going to — projected — 6 and 7 percent even .
i was the kind of kid who was always bugging mom and dad with whatever great fact i had just read about — haley &apos;s comet or giant squids or the size of the world &apos;s biggest pumpkin pie or whatever it was .
we &apos;re really dominated now by those things that we &apos;re using up faster and faster and faster .
the topology , the geography of the web is text-to-text links for the most part .
it &apos;s china , right ?
so a rational choice economist would say , well , you should take all non-zero offers .
that , to me , is an incredible thing .
in severe drought periods nobody has seen this water body getting dried up .
afterwards was the shower , and she loved this part .
when our home minister announces a few weeks ago a war on one third of india , about 200 districts that he mentioned were ungovernable , he missed the point .

the grandmother was incredibly fond , deeply in love with this little girl .
and in that bond , you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you &apos;ve done a task that you can &apos;t explain to someone else .
it &apos;s actually been spreading all around the world and mainly through our kind of food systems that we &apos;re exporting .
it &apos;s natural for me . me and my friends , i can connect to them easily .
australia , because there just aren &apos;t very many people there .
and each of them had a different take on this .
well , the next thing they have to show is what was on abc news , channel 7 , last week in new york city , in the 11 o &apos;clock news .
occasionally , throughout history , this concept of this very large cosmic perspective comes to the surface , and as a result we see transformative and profound discoveries .
and every year i go there and make a map of my study site .
what we saw was a natural experiment .
i tell you this because i know what you think of when you hear the word &quot; &quot; writer . &quot; &quot; i tell you this so that all of you out there who work so hard , whether you run a company or a country or a classroom or a store or a home , take me seriously when i talk about working , so you &apos;ll get that i don &apos;t peck at a computer and imagine all day , so you &apos;ll hear me when i say that i understand that a dream job is not about dreaming .

and then eventually even ragù hired howard , and howard did the exact same thing for ragù that he did for prego .
let &apos;s look at ebola .
it is even more true if we go after hackers that are willing to risk their own freedom for ideals like the freedom of the web , especially in times like this , like today even , as governments and corporates fight to control the internet .
rod : no , i love it . it &apos;s the new me .
and for the first time , i was affected by this communal unrest .

i flew too , my head bobbing on broken bones , and when i landed , i was a quadriplegic .
what is so difficult and challenging is that we are also the objects of these changes .
this proposition will be found on careful examination to express , in condensed form , the essential purport of the theory , and to express in a few words all mr. darwin ’ s meaning ; who , by a strange inversion of reasoning , seems to think absolute ignorance fully qualified to take the place of absolute wisdom in the achievements of creative skill . &quot; &quot; exactly . exactly . and it is a strange inversion .
so , from both directions , there is kind of , i think , a lack of understanding about what it could mean to be an artist who uses the materials of his own day , or her own day , which i think artists are obliged to do , is to really explore the expressive potential of the new tools that we have .
being serious is hard .
now the challenge for all of us is : how do you create environments that allow these ideas to have this kind of long half-life , right ?
it appears often in unconstrained social systems where people are allowed to contribute as much or as little as they like — this is often what you get . right ?
and we were unprepared for this , and they were shaping the aid effort .
you can see it in the upper left-hand corner .
if you look down here , it &apos;s fine . if you look up here , then you get conflicting data .
so , that &apos;s where we were at the end of about 15 months .
the third idea i want to share with you is that music , paradoxically , i think even more than words , is one of the very best ways we have of showing who we really are . i love giving talks , although strangely i feel more nervous giving talks than playing music .
now we &apos;re also about to publish a study — the first study showing you can change gene expression in men with prostate cancer .
so , the laws of physics have this special property , that physical objects as unlike each other as they could possibly be , can nevertheless embody the same mathematical and causal structure and to do it more and more so over time .
we talk about how another world isn &apos;t just possible ; another world &apos;s here .
which groups record more walking distance by pedometer , we give them prizes . we do this constantly .

another millimeter ?
go from 3,000 to 2,000 , from 1,500 to 1,000 .
and this is what we &apos;ve lost in afghanistan and iraq .
and a few years ago , a wonderful researcher named kevin dunbar decided to go around and basically do the big brother approach to figuring out where good ideas come from .
and if we look to the future , it &apos;s an unsustainable diet .
man : so this is the cotton sari .
then we had a joint band , israeli and palestinian musicians , and we did some belly-dancing .
organisms exist only during certain geological intervals .
the problem is these are arousal addictions .
and our third generation car , which should hopefully be out in about three or four years will be a $ 30,000 car .
it took me a week , it took me a week to make the picture which you see here today , and i &apos;ll tell you why . ( applause ) it &apos;s very , very , very simple — i spent a week going around the village , and i went to every single one : &quot; &quot; hello , can you meet at the tree ?
so following the agile model , we ask three questions : what worked well in our family this week , what didn &apos;t work well , and what will we agree to work on in the week ahead ?

the kids can &apos;t sit still long enough to focus , so they don &apos;t learn .
after all , what constitutes a world leader ?
websites are often very visual , and there are all these sorts of graphs that aren &apos;t labeled and buttons that aren &apos;t labeled , and that &apos;s why the world wide web consortium 3 , known as w3c , has developed worldwide standards for the internet .

now if any of you guys would ever come to our house in tucson for the first time , gabby would usually go up to the freezer and pull out the piece of tupperware that has the real skull . ( laughter ) gg : the real skull . mk : which freaks people out , sometimes .
and many think that these countries are stagnant , but they are not .
he built minarets with their heads .
gp : thank you very much.bg : thank you . ( applause )
why ? because , as many of us know , v.c. is actually quite short-term .

an early example comes from the great astronomer johannes kepler who was obsessed with understanding a different number — why the sun is 93 million miles away from the earth .
in parallel , a small mission to a comet , what you see here , giotto , was launched , and in 1986 , flew by the comet of halley with an armada of other spacecraft .
and it occurs everywhere — you know , why bother ?
( laughter ) well , they ’ re still coming in from the back there ; they ’ re still coming in .

laura schulz : told you . ( laughs ) ( video ) hg : see this one ? ( ball squeaks ) hey clara , this one &apos;s for you . you can go ahead and play .
today we know that families are living further and further apart , and that definitely takes a toll on family relationships and family bonds over distance .
there &apos;s no malevolence , they &apos;re just pressing a button .
so the big question about the future of new power , in my view , is : will that old power just emerge ?
there are good liars and bad liars .
what happens when you combine these technologies together : increasing availability of facial data ; improving facial recognizing ability by computers ; but also cloud computing , which gives anyone in this theater the kind of computational power which a few years ago was only the domain of three-letter agencies ; and ubiquitous computing , which allows my phone , which is not a supercomputer , to connect to the internet and do there hundreds of thousands of face metrics in a few seconds ?
we are , definitely .
a lot of people like to point to some place else as the cause of the problem .
and at a certain point , you look around , you &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; whoa , this is a really nerdy crowd . &quot; &quot; and i mean like this is a nerdy crowd , but that &apos;s like a couple of levels above furries .
well , i &apos;ll quickly show you two options .
and what people are beginning to ask is : surely , just as we invest in r and d , two , three , four percent , of our gdp , of our economy , what if we put , let &apos;s say , one percent of public spending into social innovation , into elder care , new kinds of education , new ways of helping the disabled ?
that &apos;s what the spider has to interact with their environment .
jay forrester : hello new york , this is cambridge .
so our approach is something we call targeted reinnervation .
it is now a network instead of a perfect tree .
the point isn &apos;t to live without any regrets .
what i &apos;m going to argue today is that because there &apos;s no copyright protection in the fashion industry , fashion designers have actually been able to elevate utilitarian design , things to cover our naked bodies , into something that we consider art .
and it &apos;s amazing to watch .
and i think we &apos;ll meet in the middle some place , and have the classic thing that you have , which is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel .
the rest turns into a stable compound , which survives filtration into the water systems , thereby exposing the very aquatic birds that would carry flu and providing them a chance to breed resistant strains .
but still , it &apos;s a good chance . and of course , if it happens , it will transform our view of life altogether .
i &apos;m going to cut some veins , arteries .
and suddenly the old man turns to him and goes , &quot; &quot; you see this bar ?
basically , we &apos;ve come up with a way to stain tissue and color-code the surgical field .
but the entire planet warms up when there &apos;s a big el nino .
so here , further data that ultraviolet — that &apos;s sunlight — has benefits on the blood flow and the cardiovascular system .
this is our spaceship , the soyuz , that little one .
bf : last night , michael moschen showed some juggling props he has invented and working on .
we are checking maps , looking at maps , double-checking the information , and looking also at the metadata of the material .
ln : oh my god , i want a pet rabbit-camel .
the men who cut her throat then told everyone else , &quot; &quot; if you go to university , the day will come when we will kill all of you just like this . &quot; &quot; amel died at exactly 5 : 17 p.m. , which we know because when she fell in the street , her watch broke .
i put in hole in the wall computers there , downloaded all kinds of stuff from the internet about dna replication , most of which i didn &apos;t understand .
and every single time i failed , i had to start over .
and the organisms , i promise you , have all of their priorities in order .
you sort of place your bets .
sand-stopping devices , made from sand .
and the landscape is changing . three years ago , when i started thinking about this , there was one cable down the western coast of africa , represented in this map by steve song as that thin black line .
now we &apos;re moving onto washington , d.c.
and this fellow here is looking at the painting by braque .
dr : he sure nailed it , didn &apos;t he .
thorium reactor that nathan myhrvold &apos;s involved in .
you can actually do far more to build an international coalition against a harmdoer or a wrongdoer by being in the room and showing to the rest of the world that that person , that regime , is the problem and that you , the united states , are not the problem .
&quot; &quot; &apos; i &apos;m writing a book on magic , &apos; i explain , and i &apos;m asked , &apos; real magic ? &apos; by &apos; real magic , &apos; people mean miracles , thaumaturgical acts , and supernatural powers .
now people often ask me , &quot; &quot; where &apos;s your favorite place on the planet ? &quot; &quot; and the truth is i just don &apos;t have one .
but we &apos;re now up to 55 countries in the world , have had this virus emerge , in either birds , or people or both .
but then i would get these plaintive emails from him when he was at work .
so in my 12 years of wisdom , i zip my pants down , i walk out into the room , and lo and behold to me , while i was in the room with sheila , johnny was back at the window calling guys up .
i watch what people do .
so my question is , why don &apos;t we ask for the things that we need ?
it is about finding the truth .
and she was horrified to get there and find that they didn &apos;t have a toilet .
so we calculate the percent reduction per year , but it &apos;s sort of the same percentage .
we also observe another thing , and that is , you folks not only are solving fewer puzzles , you &apos;re also putting less juice into the task — less effort , you &apos;re less persistent , and so on .
where do they get their money ?
iw : one day we had a lesson in class where we learned about significant people , like nelson mandela , lady diana and mahatma gandhi .
that feeling was the trigger for me to actually change my career — from being a software engineer to become a science writer — so that i could partake in the joy of science , and also the joy of communicating it to others .
of that stuff , what do you carry ?
and so what you can do with that is to plot the distribution of species and where they occur in the oceans .
we hailed a boat from a nearby resort , and then were quickly handed over to indonesian water police .
it basically boils down to the bushehr nuclear power plant and to the natanz fuel enrichment plant .

and i noticed that she was clowning around .
just days before terence died , his oncologist said , &quot; tell terence that better days are just ahead . &quot;
on the way to the children &apos;s home , i started to ask myself , &quot; what &apos;s happened to me ? &quot;
this moral foundation underlies about 70 percent of the moral statements i &apos;ve heard here at ted .
the fact that a company like airbus is now seriously working on flying urban taxis is telling us something .
but i think what &apos;s really interesting is not just that the three friends and the stranger did a better job , but how they felt about it .
so i have good news and bad news .
sea urchins crawl across the bodies feeding at night .
in rodents , it was known to make mothers care for their offspring , and in some creatures , allowed for toleration of burrowmates .
but they weren &apos;t given that choice , because their own citizens beat them to the punch .
i often ask myself , &quot; &quot; what would design be like if objects were made of a single part ?
it should be done by fun . generosity is more fun . that &apos;s the key .
i don &apos;t blame them .
so we see a bottom-up approach here , because all the information , as i said , are inside the dna .
finally , psychopaths &apos; amygdalas are smaller than average by about 18 or 20 percent .
you come out of &quot; &quot; arrive &quot; &quot; at the airport , and you follow a big yellow sign that says &quot; &quot; trains &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s in front of you .

a : yes , you did .
right now .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them .
according to scott joplin , the bands were playing on riverboats and clubs .
we don &apos;t just have one kind of receptor .
and i am hoping that many of you will respond to this .
because when we &apos;re dealing with infectious diseases , we &apos;re dealing with living systems .
and that &apos;s actually where our story begins .
see these toys ? yeah , i &apos;m going to put this one over here , and i &apos;m going to give this one to you .
so , as we lose the context of our identity , it becomes incredibly important that what you share becomes the context of shared narrative , becomes the context in which we live .
but that &apos;s only half of real equality , and i now think we &apos;re never going to get there unless we recognize the other half .
now , let &apos;s take a look at a video that we &apos;re debuting at ted , for the first time , on how an effective hiv vaccine might work .
is it worth it to you ?
this ought to concern deeply those of us who care about the future of religion and the future of faith .
that &apos;s shared value .
my childhood summers were in the puget sound of washington , among the first growth and big growth .
so you probably heard that we &apos;re pretty much all the same in terms of our human dna .
this is where its intelligence lies .
this is part of cybercrime which is a $ 2-trillion-a-year discontinuity in the global economy .
that &apos;s still conventional bits , the step after that is — this is an earlier prototype in the lab ; this is high-speed video slowed down .
i don &apos;t understand why this keeps happening .
now , frank didn &apos;t hear anything .
but to insist on only these negative stories is to flatten my experience and to overlook the many other stories that formed me .
and that &apos;s a critical area of national security and economic vitality , to make sure we produce the next generation of scientists , engineers , mathematicians and technologists .
asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment .
( laughter ) it &apos;s in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between this technocratic solution and a larger , sort of more romantic image of where we are .
how could we use a technology like this to add a completely new kind of sense , to expand the human umvelt ?
and then not only humans .
well , it turns out all of the three beliefs are wrong .
it binds us into teams that circle around sacred values but thereby makes us go blind to objective reality .
( music ) ( applause ) so the next step for us in this process is now to find a way to let all of you build things like this , and so the way that we &apos;re approaching that is by teaching workshops to people where we explain how they can use these kinds of tools , and then also working to get the tools and the materials and techniques out into the real world in a variety of ways .
and right now i &apos;m creating a set of lipsticks that are infused with these chemicals that allow me to interact with a plant on its own chemical signatures — lipsticks that cause plants to grow where i kiss it , plants that blossom where i kiss the bloom .
the first at least is populist , and the second is elitist .
so , this is what the planet &apos;s going to look like in 20 years .
and i would bring people to the lab and i would put their finger in it , and i would crunch it a little bit .
don &apos;t worry .
they showed us how the entire operation works , and what they really convinced us on the spot was that if you can show up in real time and stop people , it &apos;s enough of a deterrent they won &apos;t come back .
this is the wiki map , this is the open street map .
but the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre-industrial world .
i won &apos;t go into the intrascatter that &apos;s in the subtests , but they still had a neurologic issue .
and i &apos;m not saying that we should copy nature , i &apos;m not saying we should mimic biology , instead i propose that we can borrow nature &apos;s processes .
three years , and we can &apos;t do that now . crazy .
and it feels good .
if i could ask shadi and mouaz the second they stepped into the freezing waters of the english channel , they would probably say , &quot; &quot; this is worth the risk , &quot; &quot; because they could no longer see any other option .
now this is very unusual , because globally we find that , not surprisingly , people feel better as their country gets richer .
they &apos;re inanimate , they &apos;re not alive .
they &apos;re poets , they &apos;re philosophers , they &apos;re photographers , they &apos;re filmmakers .
four years ago i worked with a few people at the brookings institute , and i arrived at a conclusion .
that seems to make more sense .
and the reference to the ipod as iconic , and in a way evocative of performance , delivery — quite interesting that &#91; in &#93; the beginning of the year 2007 , the financial times commented that the detroit companies envy the halo effect that toyota has gained from the prius as the hybrid , energy-conscious vehicle , which rivals the ipod as an iconic product .
third fact : i bet you didn &apos;t know that there &apos;s enough energy in hot rocks under the country to supply america &apos;s energy needs for the next thousand years . and the federal budget calls for a measly 20 million dollars of r &amp; d in geothermal energy .
every time i read chekhov and his unique vision of human life , i &apos;m reminded of why i too became a writer .
so , somebody out there says , &quot; &quot; five . &quot; &quot; a lot of you said , &quot; &quot; ten . &quot; &quot; let &apos;s think about 10 for a second .
another shape is made for cancer .
crime is down . that &apos;s a good thing .
so if i just choose a note at random , like that one .
textbook economics does not work in my context , and i have very few recommendations from anybody as to how to put together a legal economy .
we currently have 43 courses on the platform from four universities across a range of disciplines , and let me show you a little bit of an overview of what that looks like .
what happens ?
and over time , they did basically the same thing so the monkeys could learn , you know , who sold what at what price — you know , who was reliable , who wasn &apos;t , and so on .
so what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today ?
do you agree ?
that was the family business .
well , what is the answer to this ? is the answer to just give up on the idea of democracy ?
the ones that had no healthy habits had a higher risk of death .
it &apos;s very safe actually .
and in fact , this is exactly what is happening now in your brains when you listen to my sound speaking .
it &apos;s the sequel to &quot; &quot; an inconvenient truth , &quot; &quot; and it explores all the solutions that will solve the climate crisis .
if they follow protocol , they &apos;ll pick up the phone and say , &quot; &quot; hey , do you have the original ? &quot; &quot; then some droid in the back puts the name on a tickler and says , &quot; &quot; oh , this is an important letter . &quot; &quot; and you actually get into the folder that the elected official actually has to read .
kind of like tina , who miraculously survived that waterfall , and because i hate to leave a cliffhanger hanging , tina and cord did get divorced , but they got remarried three times before the show went off the air in 2012 .
we videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns .
so , i think decoding this can probably bring answers to most developed countries including the u.s. , and maybe obama &apos;s ratings can go up again .
and i &apos;ve tried to put together something that &apos;s a good start for this .
these form part of a grouping system much as the stars do .
well , why is that important ?
one problem that &apos;s happening now is , although the rates of happiness are about as flat as the surface of the moon , depression and anxiety are rising .
i imagine , for example , a closed system that &apos;s performing more efficiently than insect farming , where you can produce healthy , happy , delicious fish with little or no effluent , almost no energy and almost no water and a natural feed with a minimal footprint .
&quot; surviving the slammer : do &apos;s and don &apos;ts . &quot;
and only one contrary data point can blow your theory out of the water .
most of the time , feeling and reality are the same .
so if we &apos;ve got those evidence in our ordinary lives of the way that trust is differentiated , why do we sort of drop all that intelligence when we think about trust more abstractly ?
he &apos;s the nsa director and u.s. cyber commander , but instead of his four star general uniform , he was wearing jeans and a t-shirt .
and if we look at pachycephalosaurus , pachycephalosaurus has a solid dome and its little bumps on the back of its head were also resorbing .
people like food producers and farmers are still not aware of this problem .
this reminds me of the novel &quot; &quot; 1984 &quot; &quot; by george orwell , where the only apparently trustable person was an informer .
he says , &quot; &quot; a woman whom we need , who makes us suffer , elicits from us a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital than a man of genius who interests us . &quot; &quot; is he telling us to just go and find cruel women ?
my story of nigeria growing up was very different from the story i encountered in prison , and i had no language for it .
now , the problem here is that we the taxpayers are not getting what we pay for , because 94 percent of federal it projects are over budget or behind schedule .
the other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight .
we even found that conservatives who read the moral purity essay were significantly more likely to say that they believed in global warming and were concerned about global warming , even though this essay didn &apos;t even mention global warming .
now , the strongman hadn &apos;t told anyone , but he was actually a third-year medical student .
but then you take the toilet and you position it as a modern , trendy convenience .
and i failed them dramatically , because i allowed it to go on and on and on .
you get the people who are doing it because they believe in the mission , and they &apos;re the best people .
on the surface , we spread a thick layer of mulch , so when it &apos;s hot outside the soil stays moist .
this is a redemption we can all aspire to .
here we see entropica directing the paths of a fleet of ships , successfully discovering and utilizing the panama canal to globally extend its reach from the atlantic to the pacific .
so maybe babies should expect those yellow balls to squeak as well .
if you need a message , if nature &apos;s not enough , if you care about search and rescue , or mine clearance , or medicine , or the various things we &apos;re working on , we must preserve nature &apos;s designs , otherwise these secrets will be lost forever .
then when the school shut me down — the school actually called me into the office and told me i couldn &apos;t do it — so i went to the gas stations and i sold lots of them to the gas stations and had the gas stations sell them to their customers .
and they might be aware that they would have to fund vetting and training if they wanted to go into that market .
these people know their sense of purpose , and they activate in their life , that &apos;s worth about seven years of extra life expectancy .
because i had to focus .
and to me that &apos;s the most essential of all .
i can tell you that every official that i &apos;ve ever worked with will tell you about the letters they get and what they mean .
as the moment faded , cultural critics began endlessly debating whether or not beyoncé was , indeed , a feminist .
and that &apos;s the fisheries off the state of north carolina .
of the people who stopped when there were 24 , only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam .
but contained inside those documents was a new language , a language to understand one of the most fundamental concepts of science — namely symmetry .
thank you .
look , you have bubbles all over the world here .
i did , peter , and i left him a note about it in our special place there , and i never did hear from him again .
pan-africa gives you one billion people , granted across 55 countries with trade barriers and other impediments , but our ancestors traded across the continent before europeans drew lines around us .
it was the result of decades of sustained activism , shareholder advocacy and consumer advocacy .
i dream of a day when our patients can shed their excess pounds and cure themselves of insulin resistance , because as medical professionals , we &apos;ve shed our excess mental baggage and cured ourselves of new idea resistance sufficiently to go back to our original ideals : open minds , the courage to throw out yesterday &apos;s ideas when they don &apos;t appear to be working , and the understanding that scientific truth isn &apos;t final , but constantly evolving .
if you copied it from someone else , it &apos;s a meme .
scientists can say no , it &apos;s false .
in addition , we are in the middle of the forest region of the country , and our public space sucks .
my grandmother grew up in glasgow , back in the 1920s and &apos; 30s when rickets was a real problem and cod liver oil was brought in .
and we have this mythical image of how life was in rural areas in the past .
that &apos;s a , kind of a one-on-one thing .
we were crazy about music .
he &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; you idiot . you moron .
our hearts hurt from the failed religion of extremism , and we deserve more than the failed religion of routine-ism .
because evolution works , we actually have some evolutionary tools .
so , the ant colony is a great model : you have all these little parts that collectively add up to a great thing .
doctors and medicine made no difference at all .
i had maybe nine months .
because what people can sue for establishes the boundaries for everybody else &apos;s freedom .
people are watching us all around , &quot; &quot; right ?
and i was really surprised and asked him , had she been in contact with a radical religious leader ?
( laughter ) are you going to come and drag me off ? ( laughter )
we &apos;re so used to thinking in terms of biology , we think about genes this way .
it &apos;s solvable by being citizens , by being citizens , by being tedizens .
it turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your 80s is protective , that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need , those people &apos;s memories stay sharper longer .
it turns out you can &apos;t do fusion on a table top despite all that cold fusion nonsense . right ?
i don &apos;t know if you realize this , but 90 percent of the patients on the transplant list are actually waiting for a kidney .
you do know the solution to that , right ?
in the fashion industry , there &apos;s very little intellectual property protection .
finally , back to the united states .
i remember that it was quite successful .
but what &apos;s so awesome to consider is that if there are intelligent aliens orbiting on a planet around a star near to us and they build complicated space telescopes of the kind that we &apos;re trying to build , all they &apos;ll see is this pale blue dot , a pinprick of light .
and perhaps most remarkably , at the beginning of the 21st century , really for the first time in modern history , growth extended to almost all parts of the world .
and so what if you could design and build electronics like this ? so what if you could do it extremely quickly , extremely inexpensively , and maybe more interestingly , really fluidly and expressively and even improvisationally ?
so he got the right weight at birth .
woman : 80 &apos;s revival meets skater-punk , unless it &apos;s laundry day .
and of course , our change in standards can outpace the change in behavior . one of the reasons violence went down is that people got sick of the carnage and cruelty in their time .
( laughter ) baseball is filled with some amazing statistics .
this meant not only an artistic triumph , but also a profound emotional sympathy between the public of the most advanced nations of the world and the musical youth of latin america , as seen in venezuela , giving these audiences a message of music , vitality , energy , enthusiasm and strength .
child : and then his went on the ground .
organisms don &apos;t think of co2 as a poison .
camera . we have a picture right now .
here we have our device in which we put in a frame .
thank god we are empathetic .
it looks sickly .
how do you leverage that information ?
she stopped attending our local mosque .
we know this in india . it &apos;s called a &#91; hindi &#93; .
and if you care about climate change , you &apos;ve got to go in the opposite direction to 100 percent of our electricity from clean energy sources , as quickly as possible .
best dancer walks tall , gets the best date .
the average person talks at about 225 word per minute , but we can listen at up to 500 words per minute .
and there ’ s nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies .
and one intuition to get is actually the amount of noise or variability i show here gets bigger as the force gets bigger .
so inside it &apos;s cool and humid , which means the plants need less water to grow .
( laughter ) but , you know , the government would make a plane ; they &apos;d say , go see if that one flies , would you ?
this actually forms a large part of our decision-making process .
take a look at this one .
we prefer white . what do i mean by that ?
and dads and daughters are completing circuits in special ways .
5,000 days without interruption — that &apos;s just unbelievable .
i &apos;m merely saying that when you solve problems , you should look at all three of these equally and you should seek as far as possible to find solutions which sit in the sweet spot in the middle .
and then at 11 o &apos;clock they stopped talking about these little issues .
i started my career with trying to understand the mysteries of forests with the tools of science .
how do we know that it &apos;s wrong ? maybe you and i disagree .
it is not easy , challenging distorted religious messaging .
and at about the same time , and i think partly because of that , i started doing something that i &apos;d forgotten about in my business focus : i started to read again .
so you have an image , a retina , and a brain .
but there was this limiting factor , the issue of the code , and how to make the cells respond better , produce normal responses , and so this was our contribution .
this is known as female copulatory vocalization to the clipboard crowd .
and one day , my father actually took me into the bush .
we have an opportunity to bring in other kinds of lights — lights that can allow us to see what we currently don &apos;t see .
what we get from this adventure is just sheer joy , and joy , after all , is the end of life .
the second point i would like for you to consider is the standard of care that is provided to participants within any clinical trial .
the oil is not liquid .
i view benoit mandelbrot &apos;s work as one of the founding contributions to this kind of area .
it was the most magnificent machine ever built by humans , and it was the rocket that took us to the moon .
man 2 : okay glass , hang out with the flying club .
the huge social movement that &apos;s been involved in polio eradication is ready to do way more for these children .
now we are able to follow them and find out their secrets , where the babies go after they hatch , and remarkable things like this you &apos;re about to see .
and , i mean , i went up there expecting — i don &apos;t know what i was expecting — but , you know , when i saw a man who was missing an entire leg go up to the high jump , hop on one leg to the high jump and clear it at six feet , two inches ...
why did we do this ?
over one billion people use birth control without any hesitation at all .
we are going live to caracas to hear maestro abreu &apos;s ted prize wish .
and he kind of assumes that , yes , he &apos;ll become — these villagers — he &apos;ll become their emperor and transform their society with his wonderful command of technology and science and the elements , but , of course , realizes that without the rest of human society , he can barely make a sandwich , let alone a toaster .
js : there &apos;s obviously also something really deeply great about this .
these are sand from near the great lakes , and you can see that it &apos;s filled with minerals like pink garnet and green epidote , all kinds of amazing stuff , and if you look at different sands from different places , every single beach , every single place you look at sand , it &apos;s different . here &apos;s from big sur , like they &apos;re little jewels .
thank you .
it &apos;s said that for bees , the flower is the fountain of life , and for flowers bees are the messengers of love .
i make dictionaries .
it &apos;s the whole planet , the entire planet , continents and oceans together .
the silent majority needs to know .
( applause ) kkm : i love you . tm : i love you .
you can help speed this up .
so what we &apos;re saying here is that we took a $ 3.7 trillion gamble to save our financial systems , and you know what , it paid off .
the materiality and fleshiness and meat of the mushroom being explored by how it can hold up different objects being stuck into it .
i tried on the idea of eking out another two years in washington , or maybe uprooting my sons from their school and my husband from his work and asking them to join me .
i want you to get as close to that camel as you possibly can . &quot; &quot; so , i got a national geographic film crew .
you &apos;re saying that you can trust yourself to handle life &apos;s challenges .
the way i describe this best , i &apos;ve found , is to say that we &apos;re all used to two-by-four construction when we think about wood .
if you &apos;re curious , if you have a capacity for wonder , if you &apos;re alive , you know all that you need to know .
reality was not that easy .
he has given us the possibility to have dreams and to make true the dreams .
with an architect &apos;s help , residents literally raised it from the ground up .
and i encourage you to look at that .
the game is really one of coevolution , and coevolution is , in this particular picture , between cheetahs and gazelles .
for example , of the 216 peace agreements signed between 1975 and 2011 , 196 of them were between a state and a non-state actor .
and so they can do a simulation like this .
you &apos;re amplifying it with very powerful computers .
so the seemingly impossible is possible .
we gut it out , and we rearrange the vibrating elements in different patterns , and we actuate them to convey information about the speed , and also instructions how to use the gas and the brake pedal .
or would i be an aunt ?
it doesn &apos;t really understand you .
the maximum efficient distance for regeneration is only about one centimeter .
and the nations they &apos;re in can help .
we developed swarm methodologies .
i want to make you better at stress .
what pearl of wisdom ?
when you run the numbers on a calculator , you run out of noughts .
and we have really high standards for consent in a lot of other areas .
well , for example , if you have lots of data about places you can take , from a postcode — which is like a zip plus four — for a specific group of houses , you can make paper , print off a paper which has got very , very specific things about the bus stops , the things specifically near you .
and if we can convert all our users to using this , that &apos;s 500 billion liters of water .
( laughter ) so it &apos;s not that they didn &apos;t learn at all — they did — but much , much less than when we gave them positive information about the future .
he &apos;s absolutely balanced between innocence and experience , and that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting .
in the biological sciences , they explored the implications of the notion that order and complexity and structure arise in a self-organized way .
i &apos;ll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept .
it was cosmic radiation left over from the very birth of the universe .
he watched as a corpsman passed him over , declaring him a goner , and then leaving him to die .
now , the bomb shelters at that point — let &apos;s say you bought a prefab one — it would be a few hundred dollars , maybe up to 500 , if you got a fancy one .
but we do know that journalism , activism and public debate are being silenced in the effort to stamp out extremist speech .
and as a scientist , i love that and i love science .
elizabeth : if it please you , sir .
religious teaching , this is where we &apos;ve gone so wrong , concentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines .
and of course , &quot; &quot; electrocute &quot; &quot; is a blend of &quot; &quot; electric &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; execute . &quot; &quot; ( laughter ) you can also make words by changing how they operate .
here we go . ok .
what are we going to do about it ?
it &apos;s two and a half inches thick , and supported at two points .
it &apos;s never going to be easy .
for example , garbage discharge , something you would think just simply goes away , but the laws regulating ship discharge of garbage actually get weaker the further you are from shore .
lexicography is really more about material science .
you know , in recent years , there have been hundreds of new organizations and websites that are helping young people learn to code .
seven years ago , a student came to me and asked me to invest in his company .
please , please , stop referring to yourselves as &quot; &quot; consumers . &quot; &quot; ok ?
this book was published in 1904 .
so we &apos;ve been trying in our lab now to develop drugs that will activate this foxo cell using human cells now in order to try and come up with drugs that will delay aging and age-related diseases .
and even personalization is something that we &apos;re starting to see the beginnings of , whether it &apos;s via the personalized trajectory through the curriculum or some of the personalized feedback that we &apos;ve shown you .

europe went right up to russia , went right down to the middle east , and if the world were truly becoming more flat and more americanized , that would be less of a problem , but in a g-zero world , those countries nearest russia and nearest the middle east actually have different economic capabilities , different social stability and different political preferences and systems than core europe .

i &apos;m going to go very , very quickly through this .
so what really launched modern neuroscience was a stain called the golgi stain .
and it was my life .
if we think about the scale of size , start with an everyday object like the tennis ball , and just go down orders of magnitude in size — from the eye of a needle down to a cell , down to a bacterium , down to an enzyme — you eventually reach the nano-world .

if you &apos;re in new york , please go and see that .
my lower half is appearing at a different conference ( laughter ) in a different country .
right now , the average participant in a clinical trial is that : average .
what makes these two letters different from different interpretations by different designers ?
and i came to adore them .
now what are the implications of that ?
that &apos;s one of the deadliest diseases known to humans .
the climate has changed . i will show you : no more flooding , no more fires .
so as we get closer to the &apos; 80s , we start to reengage those symbols .
i hope you will think about getting involved with special olympics .
and no parents objected , because we were trying to save lives , and this was a lifesaver .
now , the trouble with just sending a bomb out for this thing is that you don &apos;t have anything to push against in space , because there &apos;s no air .
and this is what things sounded like from inside , next to the bag of chips .
and i went through the same period of shame and recriminations and felt cleansed and went back to work , until it happened again and again and again .
thank you . ( applause ) ( applause ) tom rielly : so max , by taking all these samples of , let &apos;s say , 10,000 people , you &apos;ll be able to tell who &apos;s healthy and who &apos;s not ?
and through her self-defense , she grabbed their adam &apos;s apples , she punched them in the eyes and she got herself free and out of the car .
and the reason we &apos;ve let ourselves down is that we &apos;re not properly studying how religions handle art .
it turned out to be about life , and having life skills .
again , numbers , words , laid out in ways that made sense .
well this is a logarithmic graph .
and suddenly , your whole world opened up .
can &apos;t see all the hands , but it looks like all of you , right ?
occasionally in america , i hear people saying sir richard and think there &apos;s some shakespearean play taking place .
another suit . ( audience : diamonds . ) lg : diamonds , perfect .
they bypassed sweden five years ago , and they are labeled a developing country .
scholars have tried to explain : why is it blue ?
so what you need to do , to take the capability of your hand , and put it on the other side of that small incision , is you need to put a wrist on that instrument .
and that you can put these on a grid that &apos;s 1,000 columns long across the top and 1,000 rows down the other way .
( laughter ) so i was hiding in the shed , like that .
i take them backwards here to their independence , when they were up here in the beginning of the 1960s .
what is the nature of accidents ?
and you see that it is injured .
and the thing that struck me the most , that broke my heart , was walking down the main street of sarajevo , where my friend aida saw the tank coming 20 years ago , and in that road were more than 12,000 red chairs , empty , and every single one of them symbolized a person who had died during the siege , just in sarajevo , not in all of bosnia , and it stretched from one end of the city to a large part of it , and the saddest for me were the tiny little chairs for the children .
another beautifully designed new building ruined by the sound of a common wall light switch .
that &apos;s a great story ! it &apos;s totally adapted for that .
it can replace , or it can inhibit actually , signals .
beautiful organizations keep asking questions .
now , i went one step further and said , &quot; &quot; why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers and just have a paper document ? let &apos;s go online . &quot; &quot; and many people might need help in computation .
it looks like uberpool is working .
we all have an inner critic that kind of guards what we say , so people don &apos;t think that we &apos;re obscene or crazy or unoriginal , and science is full of the fear of appearing unoriginal .
also , you can go double-click , drag , to highlight in one-word increments as you drag .
can we play that one ?
granted , megaffic is not as sexy as self-driving cars , but it promises to take nairobi drivers from point a to point b at least 20 percent faster .
it &apos;s certainly true for me .
number four , a kinder world .
thank you very much .

so these birds became the very icon of the everglades — an indicator species of the overall health of the system .
i could see vividly , i suppose , being filmed out of the door of a helicopter , there was , kind of , rock music playing in the background , and i had a ski pole with a union jack , you know , flying in the wind .
you know you have 46 chromosomes . if you &apos;re lucky , you &apos;ve got 23 from each parent . sometimes you get an extra one or drop one out , but — so you can skip the grandparent and great-grandparent stage and go right to the great-great-grandparent . and you have 46 people and you give them a scanner , or whatever you need , and they look at their chromosomes and each of them says which one he likes best , or she — no reason to have just two sexes any more , even . so each child has 46 parents , and i suppose you could let each group of 46 parents have 15 children .
i felt like i was a vessel of the future of humanity .
sometimes the true nature of reality beckons from just beyond the horizon .
a lot of people kind of balk at the obstacles .
and so when word came out that aims was opening , it spread very quickly via e-mail and our website .
( laughter ) for modern americans who are exposed to more options and more ads associated with options than anyone else in the world , choice is just as much about who they are as it is about what the product is .
we build a big screen , we fly it in space , we put it up in front of the star , we block out most of the light , we fly a space telescope in that shadow that &apos;s created , and boom , we get to see planets .
well , the &quot; &quot; so what ? &quot; &quot; comes when start thinking about the same problem set up just a little bit differently .
the u.s. is currently ahead in military robotics right now , but we know that in technology there &apos;s no such thing as a permanent first move or advantage .
the best part is obviously seeing the magical moments of humanity as time changed — from day into night .
helen keller said that the only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision .
and doaa was terrified of the water .
don &apos;t overdo the botox ; nobody will think you &apos;re honest .
and the conversation i had with dean kamen this morning , one of the great diy innovators , i &apos;d like to share with you — he gave me permission to do so — his technology called slingshot that many of you may have heard of , it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator .
that &apos;s 10 inches .
everyone knows , &quot; &quot; they say .
do you look me up and down , wondering how hot i must get or if my husband has forced me to wear this outfit ?
we have to go in with protective suits and breathing gear , and 30 parts per million of h2s will kill you .
cancer ? heart attacks ? diabetes ?
i have 18 out of the 19 signs of attention deficit disorder diagnosed .
he began to come twice a week to my center because women could not go to the mosque .
i &apos;m like , screw that . they &apos;re all in the pond and nobody &apos;s going into the pond .
it &apos;s amazing that 413 lbs were lost just from the extra exercise .
after the algerian war , at the heart of the international resistance movements , his name circulated and the whole world came knocking at his door .
and i &apos;ll just play you part of a mockup of it , but you get a sense of what it &apos;s like to actually enter into that moment in time and be transported back in history .
all that energy was pumped into the fabric of space and time itself , making the universe explode in gravitational waves .
he is interested in how we see as an animal , how we are interested in mimicry and camouflage .
and this is what i call behavior-changing products : products , systems or services that intervene and solve these problems up front .
after i left bimini , i actually learned that this habitat was being bulldozed to create a new golf course and resort .
he sent us to one of the best schools in the city and gave us the best education .
so you can &apos;t trust those ted folks .
one of them you heard about : dark matter , dark energy .
and of course they have more influence , sometimes , about how they &apos;re seen .
that &apos;s kind of an invitation to pick up this name of those numbers coming out there and to just drop it into the script here , and now i can steer the car with the steering wheel .
and for some reason that day , instead , i asked myself a question , and it was , where does this stuff go ?
so then , i ask , what &apos;s in it for you ?
anyway , the second thing i want to say about dying in the 21st century , apart from it &apos;s going to happen to everybody , is it &apos;s shaping up to be a bit of a train wreck for most of us , unless we do something to try and reclaim this process from the rather inexorable trajectory that it &apos;s currently on .
dr : i think there &apos;s a real opportunity to engage in a discussion of why we live in cities .
( laughter ) so i made series of images , cuttings , and i assembled them in portfolios .
so what you see in the picture there is a cell with a hormone receptor in red punching through the edge of the cell .
the problem is , how many people should there be ?
writing the oldest book in the world was job , and he said , &quot; man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward . &quot;
in another decade , joe will be released from wormwood scrubs .
you &apos;re told to do it and there &apos;s competition . how can it be fun ?
he managed to make the word tender .
you gotta be accurate ! there &apos;s measurement involved , increments .
at that time , there was only one bank that had atms in kenya , and we could not get cash . the family couldn &apos;t get cash for him to start the treatment until monday .
and yet here we are today , about half of the rainforest remains , and we have potentially more urgent problems like climate change .
now , one of the problems with looking at blood pressure is your body does everything it can to keep your blood pressure at the same place .
instead of reaching out to the common or the collective wisdom in our societies , investing in it to find more creative solutions , we reverted to political posturing .
first one : &#91; &quot; &quot; japanese farming has no youth , no water , no land and no future . &quot; &quot; &#93; that &apos;s what i landed to the day that i went to minamisanriku , one stop south of fukushima , after the disaster .
( laughter ) it &apos;s true .
so here , we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game .
normally , acquiring moral behavior is simply part of growing up , like learning to speak .
this is not accurate , but it did happen to tony blair at the davos forum in 2005 , when his doodles were , of course , &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; and he was labeled the following things .
his livelihood is predetermined by the conditions of grinding poverty .
it &apos;s one of the mysteries we still have , super flares .
now the list is done : a hundred years .
the focus was around the patient .
let &apos;s pull this apart : i &apos;ll go ahead and explode it .
one of our philosophies in the book is that no dish is really intrinsically any better than any other dish .
and it &apos;s a new cumulative pressure on leaders .
we &apos;re going to discover an ancient shipwreck , a phoenician off brazil , or a new rock formation , a new life .
so last night , we heard about wishes .
they &apos;re drinking tea , they &apos;re having sandwiches .
then somebody came in , slid their hand under and water came out , and we thought , is this what we &apos;re in for ?
by that statement , their vision should be really bad , right ?
with computer vision , i can estimate where the cars around me are , sort of , and where they &apos;re going .
that &apos;s what you see with these cameras .
the second half was just one big nap , pretty much , in class .
brenda laurel : i want to show you , real quickly , just a minute of &quot; &quot; rockett &apos;s tricky decision , &quot; &quot; which went gold two days ago .
but , you know , it doesn &apos;t matter if i &apos;m actually good at it . what matters is that my hands know how to do it .
we use the contract to raise money from socially motivated investors .
you will give your genome to the pharmacist , and your drug will be made for you and it will work much better than the ones that were — you won &apos;t have side effects .
hey , off the bed !
still under foreign domination , and without sovereignty , india and china are down in the corner .
through my work , i &apos;ve been trying to find ways to harness and unveil this .
the control of a laser is so precise that you can perform surgery inside of an eye , you can use it to store massive amounts of data , and you can use it for this beautiful experiment that my friend was struggling to explain .
they must think this guy with this dove , he must have spent years working with him .
now anonymous companies are great for sanctions busting too .
this lady is ellen van der zweep . she &apos;s one of the best dog-trainers in the world , and she believes that we can do a lot more .
and what you &apos;re typing are recordings of your eyes as you &apos;re looking at other peoples &apos; eyes .
and , you know , i was already bargaining , as a five year-old child , with dr. p to try to get out of doing these exercises , unsuccessfully , of course .
we &apos;re just going to click on naturejobs.uk.
i humbly call this development .
in particular check out asia .
why are we talking about microalgae ?
so how does it work ?
it &apos;s already immersed in social networks .
why comedy ?
nt : here are the current students at aims . there are 53 of them from 20 different countries , including 20 women .
translucence is glamorous — that &apos;s why all these people wear pearls .
( laughter ) now , after thinking about this a little bit we thought , you know , it probably would be simpler to do this with a nonlethal laser .
and that &apos;s why i lump growing lethality of hatred and death spiral of negativity under the general rubric , reasons to be cheerful .
they like to have a lot of eye contact , or mutual gaze .
now imagine what you could place in your hands : an apple , maybe your wallet .
and i rebuild them and give them new life .
what i find fascinating is that we &apos;ve actually wired our world to share , whether that &apos;s our neighborhood , our school , our office , or our facebook network , and that &apos;s creating an economy of &quot; &quot; what &apos;s mine is yours . &quot; &quot; from the mighty ebay , the grandfather of exchange marketplaces , to car-sharing companies such as goget , where you pay a monthly fee to rent cars by the hour , to social lending platforms such as zopa , that will take anyone in this audience with 100 dollars to lend , and match them with a borrower anywhere in the world , we &apos;re sharing and collaborating again in ways that i believe
and we hear all the time from our community of civic hackers at code for america that they didn &apos;t understand how much nontechnical work actually went into civic hacking projects .
he had three women helping him take care of these kids .
( video ) thumper : come on . it &apos;s all right .
he had an intuitive understanding of the mythic structure of india .
but of course , it &apos;s not about that .
so i think what we &apos;ve learned is that the risks from this money creation scheme are quite modest , but the benefits are potentially huge .
creating a big picture out of all the important little details that make up who we are .
and so it all brings us to one big question ...
that &apos;s what i want to do to change , to make a difference in the world .
( laughter ) but no , in our mind up there are a host of things going on that we don &apos;t always know how to bring to the person that we love , because we think love comes with selflessness and in fact desire comes with a certain amount of selfishness in the best sense of the word : the ability to stay connected to one &apos;s self in the presence of another .
i was on the phone with my mom in september of 2010 , and we were talking about the news of a young college freshman from rutgers university named tyler clementi .
if you see , if you hear , if you feel , if you &apos;re aware of anything , you are conscious , and they are conscious .
okay , how big was that ? it &apos;s hard to get it .
these leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like budrus .
and we &apos;ve also managed to communicate with people all over the world , from extraordinary places .
even a photon has some degree of consciousness .
and so this is the important point that i like to study : that things are beautiful , that it &apos;s still a human connection — it &apos;s just done in a different way .
this is linus torvalds .
( laughter ) men , if you get nothing else out of this talk , practice expansive listening , and you can transform your relationships .
and you can imagine , and the thing about it is , that they believed that the human mind could handle this number of images because the important thing was to get the gestalt of what the images were about .
and the gut is a silent voice — it &apos;s going more for feelings .
and then , the systemic risks .
well , imagine if you did the same task with friends while you were drinking in a pub .
anyway , you get the idea .
in fact , qq.com , which is a popular chinese website , had 35,000 comments on this issue within hours .
back in 1989 , when the berlin wall fell , an urban planner in london got a phone call from a colleague in moscow saying , basically , &quot; &quot; hi , this is vladimir . i &apos;d like to know , who &apos;s in charge of london &apos;s bread supply ? &quot; &quot; and the urban planner in london goes , &quot; &quot; what do you mean , who &apos;s in charge of london &apos;s — i mean , no one is in charge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oh , but surely someone must be in charge .
and to that end , in november of last year , the new york times and vrse made a vr project called &quot; &quot; the displaced . &quot; &quot; it launched with one million google cardboards sent out to every sunday subscriber with their newspaper .
and then left it to a contractor to install these 79-cent switches behind them .
and in the northern part of the main island , this is ground zero for world longevity .
so you look around , where you &apos;re going to land , you try to make yourself ready .
it &apos;s actually part of a very long story , a great story , that began billions of years ago .
so , i was able to launch a three-year project with caritas germany , and we trained 30 afghan women and men , and we opened 15 counseling centers in kabul .
first you need access to land .
and then , of course , nasa also had a big announcement , and president clinton gave a press conference , about this amazing discovery of life in a martian meteorite .
how do i put that simply ? no .
so what will you do ? i &apos;ll tell you what i did and why i did it . and i know my time &apos;s up .
it was a tuesday .
i am wondering what &apos;s your take on the cut by 70 percent for 2070 .
and so some of the things that we &apos;re thinking of , and many other people in the field are thinking of , are actually developing materials for that .
and those are the specific genes that differ from one to the other .
the deal is , any time you &apos;re in a wi-fi hotspot , all your calls are free .
and they &apos;re actually immune to lots of evidence .
many male journalists in my society , they want to cover a story about drug addiction in my country .
everybody was grabbing something .
we all split up into many groups as we argued over what to do next .
&quot; &quot; is dating boring , now that humans reproduce asexually ? &quot; &quot; who do we got ?
what exactly to the people watching this do every day ?
so , the flow of resources from the commodity booms to the bottom billion are without precedent .
so just with these three dinosaurs , as a scientist , we can easily hypothesize that it is just a growth series of the same animal .
and especially as suburbia is becoming less centered on the family , the family households , there &apos;s a real hunger for more third places .
and if you get out and walk around to the other side of the car , you see a life-sized light box of the car showing you how it works .
so really having computing work and understand you and understand that information , we really haven &apos;t done that yet .
here in new york , the department of sanitation cleans up after us , to the tune of 11,000 tons of garbage and 2,000 tons of recyclables every day .
so those are not her pearl earrings . whose are they ?
we get jealous , not because we &apos;re evil , but because we have little artists pent up inside us .
each frame of the movie has information about itself .
well , an excavation was begun immediately , and more and more little bits of skull started to be extracted from the sediment .
so what studio h might offer her is a way to develop skills so that she might give back in the most meaningful way .
when this happened , a part of me thought , well , what &apos;s the big deal ?
what &apos;s the kind of environmental — what is the space of creativity ?
the real challenge is up to you : to take this tool and figure out how we can use it all across america and around the world , so that instead of recording thousands of storycorps interviews a year , we could potentially record tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands or maybe even more .
you can see , actually that &apos;s a fluoroscopy .
well , the lessons aren &apos;t about wealth or fame or working harder and harder .
it was a terrible time .
those of us who believe in heaven have some sort of idea of what heaven would be .
perspective , that kind of alchemy we humans get to play with , turning anguish into a flower .
i grew up in the middle of nowhere on a dirt road in rural arkansas , an hour from the nearest movie theater .
it &apos;s very difficult for a politician , because you &apos;re afraid that many lives have been lost in vain .
we believe that the blast was right outside the gate of taji , we &apos;re heading to that location now .
even in the times of h1n1 , i like the word .
and if it can do that , maybe it can also change your behavior .
riccardo muti , please .
the water &apos;s stiff .
actually , i work for you . you pay my salary .
i know this makes you embarrassed .
so they might curb traffic , or put in a park bench , or some green space .
yeah , so a couple of years ago i was turning 60 , and i don &apos;t like being 60 .
now , at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning when you &apos;re all alone , haven &apos;t had much sleep , that was a very romantic idea , but it was that idea — the fact that you could in fact prove that there &apos;s somebody out there just using this same technology — that appealed to me so much that 20 years later i took a job at the seti institute . now , i have to say that my memory is notoriously porous , and i &apos;ve often wondered whether there was any truth in this story , or i was just , you know , misremembering something , but i recently just blew up this old negative of mine ,
( laughter ) additionally , i &apos;ve heard horror stories from people whose teachers scolded them , of course , for doodling in classrooms .
i mean , let &apos;s just put it out there , face the fact that women are — in a time when we have more open doors , and more opportunities — are still not getting to the leadership positions .
it lives throughout the tropics , the americas , africa , asia , australia , into the pacific .
so i think that &apos;s another big point .
so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time , that chunk of metal can be in two different places , then why not you ?
and i think in our family we were very lucky , because we learned about design backwards .
and we &apos;re doing the same thing we did for — more or less , that we &apos;ve done since the civil war , a stick and a hook .
well if you think it &apos;s going to last 18 months , are you going to buy 18 months worth of masks for every single person in your family ?
we then go on to the first thing that was very surprising .
i play squash and ice hockey , two very fast sports , and i wouldn &apos;t give them up for the world .
and then she got to heathrow , and she had a little time to spare before her final leg , so she thought up another funny little acerbic joke : &#91; going to africa . hope i don &apos;t get aids . just kidding . i &apos;m white ! &#93; and she chuckled to herself , pressed send , got on the plane , got no replies , turned off her phone , fell asleep , woke up 11 hours later , turned on her phone while the plane was taxiing on the runway , and straightaway there was a message from somebody that she hadn &apos;t spoken to since high school , that said , &quot; &quot; i am so sorry to see what &apos;s happening to you . &quot; &quot;
we can make a difference , and make a difference , not just for women , but for a global economy that desperately needs their contributions .
and he would say , &quot; &quot; ruby , what are you saying ? &quot; &quot; and she &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m not talking . &quot; &quot; and finally he said , &quot; &quot; ruby , i see that you &apos;re talking .
so vehicle fitness opens a new automotive competitive strategy that can double the oil savings over the next 40 years , but then also make electrification affordable , and that displaces the rest of the oil .
( laughter ) around christmas , in my home in tennessee , a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled .
everybody &apos;s got an opinion .
belshazzar , the son of nebuchadnezzar , nebuchadnezzar who &apos;d conquered israel , sacked jerusalem and captured the people and taken the jews back to babylon .
now , in ethiopia , we &apos;re in the process of designing the first organized ethiopia commodity exchange .
he &apos;d had cataract surgery .
her story has a positive ending , but there are thousands of others in similar situations who are much less fortunate .
we were , like , 10 , i think .
usually , you &apos;re not scared .
most importantly , what we &apos;re learning is that nature has provided us a spectacular toolbox .
and it &apos;s clearly in the area of finance .
you see , hummingbirds are not hypersonic , but they are maneuverable .
the freshness , the capacity . i can turn this image .
my spirituality , my faith , being a hillbilly — i can say that , you can &apos;t — all of it is fair game .
kt : look at the road — ( beep ) still got that goddamn blindfold on .
but there are a lot of similarities .
and of course that &apos;s a highly competitive space .
it &apos;s not a matter of calculation .
and we had about 10.2 million plastic surgeries in the united states , except that with the technologies that are coming online today , today &apos;s corrections , deletions , augmentations and enhancements are going to seem like child &apos;s play .
so sort of an interesting strange fact to find a visual structure right in the middle of their spring .
what &apos;s the recipe for a certain cocktail ?
it &apos;s a promise .
so they can actually inflate it and deflate it according to their emotions .
and so on and so forth . what does this piece require ?
you know , i think people go into a restaurant , and somebody orders a steak , and we all know where steak comes from , and somebody orders a chicken , and we know what a chicken is , but when they &apos;re eating bluefin sushi , do they have any sense of the magnificent animal that they &apos;re consuming ?
and that &apos;s a unique opportunity , i would say , in design .
i even finished my credits on time and graduated with my class .
so this , for example , when you see bees flying around these little plants , and they &apos;re collecting pollen , those pollen grains that they &apos;re collecting , they pack into their legs and they take it back to the hive , and that &apos;s what makes the beehive , the wax in the beehive . and they &apos;re also collecting nectar , and that &apos;s what makes the honey that we eat .
and i say that not because i am african , but it &apos;s in africa that you find the earliest evidence for human ancestors , upright walking traces , even the first technologies in the form of stone tools .
it &apos;s made life difficult in many ways , and growing up , i struggled to fit in socially .
my name is joshua walters .
( laughter ) yeah ? i would actually prefer to do it more this way .
i &apos;ve rescued children as young as three years , and i &apos;ve rescued women as old as 40 years .
you can see how we &apos;re using the science — the physics of water , light and movement — to tether that artistic freedom .
and it &apos;s such an amazing phenomenon that the fact that it &apos;s disappearing should frighten you , at least a little bit .
i was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors .
and i think that &apos;s a fundamentally interesting question .
and it &apos;s very important for research in medicine .
but i think it &apos;s a tragedy when one of them doesn &apos;t see the other .
do you know how much of us all pretend to be somebody we &apos;re not ?
yet , we dither , taking no action to divert the asteroid , even though the longer we wait , the more difficult and expensive it becomes .
but there isn &apos;t anyone else ; there &apos;s just you .
what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?
and not just individual machines , but fleets of locomotives , airplanes , entire systems like power grids , hospitals .
it &apos;s the institutions .
leadership training in google , for example , places a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities , such as self-awareness , self-mastery , empathy and compassion , because we believe that leadership begins with character .
that &apos;s a more partisan area .
bg : yeah , well people can take , there is some aid that was well-meaning and didn &apos;t go well .
and they had the reporters and their producers participate .
so why is it so important ?
what he did is tell them it was time for them to think about rethinking what they were supposed to do .
( laughter ) so , can you imagine new york policemen giving out condoms ?
and so now we go onto enceladus . enceladus is a small moon , it &apos;s about a tenth the size of titan . and you can see it here next to england , just to show you the size . this is not meant to be a threat .
bono spoke very eloquently , that we have the tools , for the first time , to address age-old problems of disease and poverty .
now , not all of us have meadows , or lawns that we can convert , and so you can always , of course , grow a meadow in a pot .
we &apos;re going to face two really thorny sets of challenges as we head deeper into the future that we &apos;re creating .
but forget her breasts .
and there &apos;s nothing like swimming for 50 hours in the ocean that gets you thinking about things like this .
in fact , research has shown that the more the world is flat , if i use tom friedman &apos;s analogy , or global , the more and more people are wanting to be different .
but robotic weapons might be every bit as dangerous , because they will almost certainly be used , and they would also be corrosive to our democratic institutions .

what &apos;s even scarier is that when the pie does not grow , each of us get a smaller piece .
meanwhile , these guys are sitting back , collecting all sorts of data about our behavior and how we interact with the service .

we moved into our apartment that night in a new town in what felt like a completely different world .
but since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement , ( laughter ) that is , what distinguishes games from productive activity , ( laughter ) it is quite impossible to say that any of a game &apos;s arbitrary rules is essential . &quot; &quot; so there you have justice scalia taking on the aristotelian premise of the majority &apos;s opinion .

so in this ambition to capture songs from the universe , we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have , because black holes can bang on space-time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song , which i &apos;d like to play for you — some of our predictions for what that song will be like .

the idea behind 4d printing is that you take multi-material 3d printing — so you can deposit multiple materials — and you add a new capability , which is transformation , that right off the bed , the parts can transform from one shape to another shape directly on their own .

he just looked up at the sky , and he said , &quot; excuse me , can you not see that i &apos;m driving ? &quot;
there &apos;s only one absolute reality by definition , one absolute being by definition , because absolute is , by definition , single , and absolute and singular .

what we have trouble accessing is the transition space that must naturally follow , and creating the peace space that allows us to move on .

and it went from about 25 million dollars to 150 million dollars .
it &apos;s turning into one of these big emergent systems like the financial system , where we &apos;ve designed all the parts but nobody really exactly understands how it operates and all the little details of it and what kinds of emergent behaviors it can have .
and that incites a sort of panic architecture — &quot; oh no , where &apos;s this thing ? &quot;

so we can record information and then drive information back in — sort of computing what the brain needs in order to augment its information processing .

so with hydro maxed out , coal and lose the climate , or nuclear , which is the current operating low-carbon source , and maybe save the climate .

so where we used to think of heart disease as being a man &apos;s problem primarily — which that was never true , but that was kind of how everybody thought in the 1950s and &apos; 60s , and it was in all the textbooks .

now , crispr has been the subject of a huge media hype , and the words that are used most often are &quot; &quot; easy &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; cheap . &quot; &quot; so what i want to do is drill down a little bit deeper and look into some of the myths and the realities around crispr .
in change and development and growth .
and by turning things off , it &apos;s more or less a zero .
( laughter ) but that &apos;s not the way most scientists think .

see this hand ?
we &apos;re supported in our demands by global bodies like unaids , the world health organization and amnesty international .
so let &apos;s change that .
the challenge , though , is given those deep-rooted feelings , those deep-rooted emotions and thought patterns , what the chinese call &quot; &quot; sīwéi , &quot; &quot; ways of thinking , how can we craft a basis for a common future between these two ?
so we have three pictures , potentially of the same person of the same age as leonardo at the time .

so most fossils out there in the fossil record are actually completely devoid of all organic signatures .
so , how much would this cost ?
where we &apos;ve come from , what kind of people we are , and it needs to , by doing that , it needs to afford us a glimpse to where we &apos;re going in order to allow us to dwell in a hopeful present .

but it doesn &apos;t have to be this way .
but when we &apos;re done with that analysis what we &apos;ll do is we &apos;ll take a small fragment of the bone and we &apos;ll extract dna from it .
now during this time , the book was the king of storytelling .
i shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses . i shall pop this in my pocket .
the principle is you just need those three things — variation , selection and heredity .

and this sequence shows the buildup of that model .
but i have fought to be in this country and i continue to do so every day .
i don &apos;t need to know more . i don &apos;t want to know .
so photographing there , i was hoping to highlight the tenuous relationship between truth and fiction , in both his life and in photography .

a very powerful message appachan : i watch the world wake up every day .
there is no reason that architecture should shy away and present this illusory world of the simple .
i will see you through this .

and you can actually submit those results to the database , and tell us a little about your genealogical background , have the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort .
that &apos;s why we must have that long-term perspective , but we must measure the impact over 10-year periods .
so these are fantastic images .
they are elephant-adapted .
thank you very much .
and so i did some experiments .
but sometimes it &apos;s very paradoxical .
one of the magical things about this journey , however , is that because i &apos;m walking over the sea , over this floating , drifting , shifting crust of ice that &apos;s floating on top of the arctic ocean is it &apos;s an environment that &apos;s in a constant state of flux .
so this is — probably the thing i &apos;m most passionate about is the research that we &apos;ve been doing on illiteracy and how people who are illiterate communicate .
this , &quot; &quot; he wrote , &quot; &quot; is the interrelated structure of reality . &quot; &quot; then mother teresa , another mystic warrior , who said , &quot; &quot; the problem with the world is that we draw the circle of our family too small . &quot; &quot; and nelson mandela , who lives by the african concept of &quot; &quot; ubuntu , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; i need you in order to be me , and you need me in order to be you . &quot; &quot; now we all love to trot out these three mystic warriors as if they were born with the saint gene .

and then in the 13th century , more lines and new shapes of notes locked in the concept of the tune exactly , and that led to the kind of notation we have today .
but when it comes to lying and what we want to do with our lives , i think we can go back to diogenes and confucius . and they were less concerned about whether to lie or not to lie , and more concerned about being true to the self , and i think this is really important .
you are the individuals you are , and you have this kind of core .

one of my twitter friends can type only with his toes .

so after we made our discoveries with little c. elegans , people who worked on other kinds of animals started asking , if we made the same daf-2 mutation , the hormone receptor mutation , in other animals , will they live longer ?
hugely viral video . extremely popular .
because you see , whenever people do anything , for example if i want to touch this blackboard , my brain first builds up a schema , a prediction of exactly what my muscles will do before i even start moving my hand , and if i get blocked , if my schema doesn &apos;t match reality , that causes extra stress called cognitive dissonance .
it &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
the reason why i don &apos;t believe that tells us that the neanderthals had language is — here &apos;s a simple analogy : ferraris are cars that have engines .
and here is the long-probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic , because the mimic doesn &apos;t give it any nectar . it thought it would get some .
and its 225 largest companies today are worth one quarter of what they were 18 years ago .
the boy is wearing his favorite t-shirt given to him as a gift by his father after a trip to sydney , and you and i can all tell how happy he is and what &apos;s exactly on his mind at that moment .
we &apos;ve been together ever since . gg : yes .
most people think they know what origami is . it &apos;s this : flapping birds , toys , cootie catchers , that sort of thing .
what is going on here ?
i &apos;m sorry , you &apos;ve got to do a little bit of that , jody .

so henry timms and i — henry &apos;s a fellow movement builder — got talking one day and we started to think , how can we make sense of this new world ?
and so , needless to say , over those years i &apos;ve had a chance to look at education reform from a lot of perspectives .

then there was a sharp decline during the first half of the 20th century , and in the recent decade , you can see that the u.s. has become more unequal than europe , and this is the first fact i just talked about .
this is my father , clinton george &quot; &quot; bageye &quot; &quot; grant .

because over the last 30 years , people from outside the automotive industry have spent countless billions creating the needed miracles , but for entirely different purposes .
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
and compared to the little pain that it &apos;s going to cause — because it &apos;s going to be embarrassing when i &apos;m looking on his phone and seeing that he has a farmville problem and that whole bit — that &apos;s overwhelmed by the value of looking at the phone .
co2 as a building block .
they create a middle office .
so i didn &apos;t think much about it .
take a look at one of our spots .
but that &apos;s not all what we need to do . we need to use active systems .
judges have the best intentions when they make these decisions about risk , but they &apos;re making them subjectively .
i got curious again .

some of them came to tony &apos;s program , called harlem grown , to get the only meal they had each day .

so a flight from conversation can really matter because it can compromise our capacity for self-reflection .
with the our cities network , the meu rio team hopes to share what we have learned with other people who want to create similar initiatives in their own cities .
tapirs cross the highways after dark , so the stickers will hopefully help drivers see this shining thing crossing the highway , and maybe they will slow down a little bit .
we just had a workshop in guatemala .
it doesn &apos;t have to be always dissection .
the reason for that is that many people say you have to get rich first before you get few babies .
the if-then model — &quot; &quot; if this happens i will be happy &quot; &quot; — the model itself is flawed .
what we found is that in very remote areas , these droughts are having a big negative impact on tropical forests .
you board the plane . the plane takes off . the engine fails .
and for me , as a service provider , i would never be able to provide you a car for an hour if the transaction cost was anything .
connecting in sips may work for gathering discrete bits of information , they may work for saying , &quot; &quot; i &apos;m thinking about you , &quot; &quot; or even for saying , &quot; &quot; i love you , &quot; &quot; — i mean , look at how i felt when i got that text from my daughter — but they don &apos;t really work for learning about each other , for really coming to know and understand each other .
but there was one programmer who decided that this wasn &apos;t the way to work .
so we should better make sure that data is helping .
that &apos;s what happened with my dad .
as you can imagine , i bled . i bled .
manhattan no longer spreads its infinity .
so , i &apos;m not going to quote myself on this .
and we used this opportunity to exploit the specific situation .

( laughter ) ( applause ) it &apos;s clear that it &apos;s not easy to know which ballast to drop and which altitude to take . sometime we need friends , family members or a psychiatrist .
and i thought , &quot; &quot; what am i thinking ?
it &apos;s such a fatalistic adage .
and he was waving a piece of paper , and he was yelling , &quot; call washington ! call washington ! &quot;

it &apos;s in this world , &quot; &quot; he said .
you &apos;re probably thinking , my kid would never sext .
so completely in secret and without his consent , prosecutors got risen &apos;s phone records .
so what &apos;s going on here ?
what do you see in this particular one here , in this field ?
and actually , just last week i got a 300-pound load cell up and running , and i &apos;ve clocked these animals generating well over 200 pounds of force .
that tells us we were all still living in africa at that time .
and while this happens , the population will grow from seven to nine billion people , the economy will grow from 60 trillion dollars in 2010 to 200 trillion dollars .
this is another way that our mind was shifted , and twitter wasn &apos;t what we thought it was .
but this does not apply the other way around .
and there &apos;s a voice on the train , you know the voice was a human voice .
and this is the fourth time , and i come here for this wisdom , i think .
we took our chip over to hewlett-packard and used their atomic force microscope on one of these spots , and this is what you see : you can actually see the strands of dna lying flat on the glass here .
and my studio is very close to the monkey forest .
they knew that their hospitals were the right place for patients , and they knew it was very unethical to run any kind of trial or experiment .

so , here &apos;s the first door . you know , you get the message .
each unit takes its message — so negative 120 — it rotates to that , checks if it got there and then passes it to its neighbor .
you &apos;ll see — let &apos;s see , it &apos;s coming up possibly at the very end — maybe not .
thank you very much for your time .
and one of the other things i &apos;d been interested in and obsessed with over the years is spines and skeletons , having collected a couple of hundred .
&quot; well she &apos;s back , &quot; in just that tone of voice .

and our test pilot gave us the best feedback you can get from a test pilot after a first flight , which was that it was &quot; &quot; remarkably unremarkable . &quot; &quot; he would go onto tell us that the transition had been the easiest airplane to land that he &apos;d flown in his entire 30-year career as a test pilot .
thank you very much .
so let &apos;s bring a romance novelist into this conversation .
my mom plays piano , and she learned to play before they had a piano at home in cape breton . before mom &apos;s family had a piano in cape breton , she learned to play the rhythms on a piece of board , and the fiddlers would all congregate to play on the cold winter &apos;s evenings and mom would be banging on this board , so when they bought a piano , they bought it in toronto and had it taken by train and brought in on a horse , a horse and sleigh to the house .
these are a — this is like a 15 million dollar line .
these three intertwined processes have completely annihilated all the traditional bearings of western societies , with radical consequences for the individual .

you all are accustomed to having your cellphones work the large majority of the time .
so before i go any further , i really want to take a moment to stop and say thank you to that stranger .
start deleting emails .
they were a pervasive presence .
and what it turned out was going on was that facebook was looking at which links i clicked on , and it was noticing that , actually , i was clicking more on my liberal friends &apos; links than on my conservative friends &apos; links .
and where they are is indicated over here .
we should send peacekeeping troops to serve those who are facing a civil war .
cognition is about understanding the world , emotion is about interpreting it — saying good , bad , safe , dangerous , and getting us ready to act , which is why the muscles tense or relax .
you give away all your teeth to the tooth fairy .
but it &apos;s the things that you notice when you &apos;re not actually with your instrument that in fact become so interesting , and that you want to explore through this tiny , tiny surface of a drum .
how often ? is she better than me in bed ? — questions that only inflict more pain , and keep you awake at night .

it goes from 15 homicides per million up to 150 .
i couldn &apos;t afford to find an apartment , or couldn &apos;t afford an apartment that would allow me to have the rottweiler and the cat .
so these three desire paths remind me we need to design for real human needs .
here is a very good example . take jackson pollock , for example .
well in 25 years i was mostly putting out pieces of this romance and not getting a lot back in because design on call doesn &apos;t always connect you with a circumstance in which you can produce things of this nature .
and i remember thinking about all the reasons why that was the case .
now his failure to satisfy the family life , is an inevitable association of great people .
and you have some guy that you &apos;re not quite sure what &apos;s wrong with him — oliver sacks is going to be born way in the future .
that is having real impact in a country like ethiopia , and it &apos;s why you see their child mortality numbers coming down 25 percent from 2000 to 2008 .
( applause ) thank you very , very much . i love you . ( applause )
but , uh-oh , the killers are within the camps .
and he said to me , or he handed this to me , and i read it , and it said , &quot; &quot; to daddy , love benjamin . &quot; &quot; and i thought , &quot; &quot; aw , that &apos;s really sweet .
for a while i was an interface designer .
on the contrary , clinical trials are extremely useful tools , and are much needed to address the burden of disease in developing countries .
here &apos;s the biggie , and that is , you don &apos;t have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it .
because that &apos;s where the real work of government happens .
and i had this idea that camp was going to be just like this , but better .
and the result of that was an empire that included the areas you see on the screen , and which survived for 200 years of stability until it was shattered by alexander .
it &apos;s an aircraft that tries to have its cake and eat it .
and there &apos;s no way for us here in this country to grasp really what that means to the people involved .
he holds a shotgun .
and something else that happens is that those image-making regions where you have the plotting of all these neural maps , can then provide signals to this ocean of purple that you see around , which is the association cortex , where you can make records of what went on in those islands of image-making .
here &apos;s what some of this data might look like .
in a look at the map of the u.s. — the graph here , 10 million people here , 10 million here .
i &apos;m sorry seth godin , but over the millennia , we &apos;ve seen where tribalism leads .
you can imagine that the plants growing up like kelp through cracks in the ice , growing on the surface .
you &apos;ve got to do cars in the rain ; you &apos;ve got to do cars in the snow .

if we could eventually colonize a chunk of the universe — the virgo supercluster — maybe it will take us 100 million years to get there , but if we go extinct we never will .
now i &apos;d like to you to mentally answer the following questions .
so with our marching orders from the president himself , we embarked on the purest of the scientific method : collecting data — all the data we could get our hands on — making hypotheses , creating solutions , one after the other .
three or four of us , in 1957 , put forward a partially complete theory of one of these forces , this weak force .
two of us seeking to change the world can actually make a huge difference .
whereas a self-driving system can look at that pedestrian and say , i don &apos;t know what they &apos;re about to do , slow down , take a better look , and then react appropriately after that .
the first is really the notion of people .
we can start by looking to farmers like eduardo .
they didn &apos;t think it was significant , but there was an outrage in the community .
the block was three-fifths of a mile deep , and if you compare the expanse of the calving face to the tower bridge in london , about 20 bridges wide .
so without a doubt , agriculture is the single most powerful force unleashed on this planet since the end of the ice age . no question .
well , while i was in high school , something happened .
♫ like the heather ♫ ♫ on the hillside ♫ ♫ as they drove us ♫ ♫ from the highlands ♫ ♫ like the ice flow ♫ ♫ from the arctic ♫ ♫ where we landed ♫ ♫ in newfoundland ♫ ♫ there &apos;s a color ♫ ♫ to my sorrow ♫ ♫ there &apos;s a name for ♫ ♫ all this sadness ♫ ♫ like the ocean ♫ ♫ in between us ♫ ♫ i am blue ♫ ♫ blue is a river ♫ ♫ blue remembered ♫ ♫ blue water ♫ ♫ running clear ♫ ♫ blue like a planet ♫
winston churchill once said that democracy is a terrible system except for all the rest .
so some people will go out and get people to be on one team .
we don &apos;t want to believe what we know .
and the woman would have sex with it .
and this immediately cheers him up , as his courage is stimulated to rise to the occasion .
just in the u.s. , a system like this can prevent over 60,000 delays and cancellations every year , helping seven million passengers get to their destinations on time .
so we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic , the brain determines who we &apos;re going to be .
this evolutionary flaw , which was discovered by my colleague tom eisner , has driven these fireflies to take their bright lights out into the night with treacherous intent .
so for example , one is to get rid of my real estate problem and get better signals .
but the election magic doesn &apos;t stop there .
the ten ring from the standard 75-yard distance , it looks as small as a matchstick tip held out at arm &apos;s length .
so i decided i would need to find a solution that is cheaper and faster .
there are actually people all over the world running this software , and we call them bitcoin miners .
they had people involved who were nobel laureates in economics , who reported being bored .
and so , the real question to pose is not , &quot; &quot; can we be optimistic ? &quot; &quot; it &apos;s , &quot; &quot; how can we give credible hope to that billion people ? &quot; &quot; that , to my mind , is the fundamental challenge now of development .
babies really are born with a lot of innate pleasures .
we also had to create an eye system .
so i decided instead , i would talk about someone who i think has done as much to make americans happy as perhaps anyone over the last 20 years , a man who is a great personal hero of mine : someone by the name of howard moskowitz , who is most famous for reinventing spaghetti sauce .
but we have to integrate that into our own future .
these are the people who know nature best .
these red dots are american states , and the blue triangles are canadian provinces .
we had someone talk about measuring emotions and getting machines to figure out what , to keep us from acting crazy . right ?
and they want to do their design by simulation .
will such a world dawn ?
we can apply different folding ratios to different parts of the form to create local conditions .
sounds so simple .
so most of the data i &apos;m going to present comes from this database that &apos;s available online : the world top incomes database .
we should always assume that someone we love may be suffering , regardless of what they say or how they act .
unfortunately , the science is probably closer to being climatology in that in many cases , very , very small changes can have disproportionately huge effects , and equally , vast areas of activity , enormous mergers , can actually accomplish absolutely bugger-all .
but yet , we get the sensation of something happening .
the worst eras in human history , whether in cambodia or germany or rwanda , they start like this , with negative other-izing .
the age of mammals had well and truly started 250 million years ago ...
not six months later , in july 2002 , ethiopia announced a major food crisis , to the same proportions as 1984 : 14 million people at risk of starvation .
suffice to say though , as far as i &apos;m concerned , without question , the most bizarre designs and outrageous behaviors are in the animals that live in the mid-water community .
i &apos;ve learned about resilience and i &apos;ve learned about strength .

they don &apos;t really do well together .
i had hoped my voice would be saved , but my doctors knew that the breathing tubes going down my throat might have already destroyed it .
so i packed my cat , my rottweiler and my camping gear into a 1975 chevy van , and drove off into the sunset , having fully failed to realize three critical things .
and so i decided quite at an early age i wanted to be a diplomat .

and i think this is the wrong way , i think we can start using a much more natural machine .
it is the story of the people that made it — 400 engineers and architects that i was guiding over almost a decade of collaborative work that we spent together in scripting this building , in imagining its reality and ultimately getting it built in china .
for example , i don &apos;t know if you heard about this , a little while ago in the us , there was a muslim family walking down the aisle of an airplane , talking about the safest place to sit on the plane .

so i met them and i began to listen .
you have a mind . and you have other people .
we have really no idea .
and another idea that i had as well , that was brought forward by an ecologist — he basically did a calculation where he took one liter of gas and said , well , how much carbon it would take , and how much organic material ?
i want to show you this last clip because it &apos;s going to be my last goodbye .

well , when you read through the case materials in this carrillo case , one of the things that suddenly strikes you is that the investigating officers said the lighting was good at the crime scene , at the shooting .
and here &apos;s how they work in the feedback loop .
it was all over the papers .
and if that doesn &apos;t seem fanciful enough , where do you think we &apos;re going to go ?

but it &apos;s going to require innovation that &apos;s not only going to need to focus on politics , on geopolitics , but it &apos;s also going to need to deal with questions of business management , investor behavior , consumer choice and even software design and engineering .
the answer is it matters quite a lot .
and we could exploit these multiple bounces of light .
i feel that , if we can understand what makes something like coca-cola ubiquitous , we can apply those lessons then for the public good .

now both of these options — the boy genius and the scammer — are going to make you vastly overconfident and therefore more prone to taking even bigger risks in the future .
( applause ) john hockenberry : so it sounds to me like what you &apos;re saying is that there may be some temptation on the part of people to look at your work and go — i think i &apos;ve heard this , in my kind of pop psychological understanding of play , that somehow , the way animals and humans deal with play , is that it &apos;s some sort of rehearsal for adult activity .
the engine of the fly is absolutely fascinating .
a key thing is that the major violence genes , it &apos;s called the mao-a gene .
as you probably know , the neurotransmitter associated with learning is called dopamine .

it means that he will be able to employ more ghanaians .
they found nothing .
that &apos;s pretty good , but why not get rid of the wires ?
the most interesting discovery of late , i think is the so-called immortal jellyfish , which has actually been observed in the lab to be able to be able to revert back to the polyp state after reaching full maturity .
but whenever we give a thing a name that belongs to something else , we give it a whole network of analogies too .
do you have it ? perfect .
higher the local fit , greater is the chance of scaling up .

and then i borrowed some high-tech stuff from my university : a geiger counter , a scintillation counter , a mass spectrometer , microscopes .
under the best of observation conditions , the absolute best , we only detect , encode and store in our brains bits and pieces of the entire experience in front of us , and they &apos;re stored in different parts of the brain .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , i think there are tons of great uses for unarmed civilian drones : environmental monitoring , search and rescue , logistics .

everything that happens in digital is converted , or a representation , of a one and a zero .
( laughter ) and we were in the desert .
the whole idea of hardware and software becomes thinkable for the first time with this invention .
mine was 146 .

dg : all this stuff is happening along that 40,000-mile long mountain range that we &apos;re calling the ribbon of life , because just even today , as we speak , there &apos;s life being generated there from volcanic activity .
it had by no means got the green light yet .
national socialism is all about glamour .
that &apos;s basically all we &apos;re going to be talking about here .
and that was exciting — that was fun .
the queen &apos;s in there somewhere ; she just lays eggs .
i think popcorn could change the way that we tell stories on the web , and the way we understand the world we live in .
that &apos;s the difference .
let me come back to now , now when i &apos;m a little leftist — i &apos;m certainly left-handed , so at least a lefty — and i wonder , can we on the left expect to build this ecology of freedom , now , in a world where we know the extraordinarily powerful influences against it , where even icons of the left like this entertain and push bills that would effectively ban the requirement of open access for government-funded research ?
and they found that the average ceo engaged in about 139 tasks in a week .

why do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle ?
it &apos;s very pretty , and it has rapidly started to overgrow the once very rich biodiversity of the northwestern mediterranean .
to do this would require a single statute , a statute establishing what we think of as small dollar funded elections , a statute of citizen-funded campaigns , and there &apos;s any number of these proposals out there : fair elections now act , the american anti-corruption act , an idea in my book that i call the grant and franklin project to give vouchers to people to fund elections , an idea of john sarbanes called the grassroots democracy act .

these drugs were brought to market . they were prescribed very widely because heart attacks are a very common thing , and it took so long for us to find out that these drugs also caused an increased rate of death that before we detected that safety signal , over 100,000 people died unnecessarily in america from the prescription of anti-arrhythmic drugs .
rl : yeah , of course there is .
but i was the recipient of a lot of flame retardant material for some reason .
you put it into a 15-liter vessel , about three gallons , and it &apos;ll cool it down to just above freezing — three degrees above freezing — for 24 hours in a 30 degree c environment . it &apos;s really cheap .

then the final part of sprawl that everyone forgot to count : if you &apos;re going to separate everything from everything else and reconnect it only with automotive infrastructure , then this is what your landscape begins to look like .
however , every summer , sadly , the machines got left behind while my parents and i traveled overseas to experience history , art and design .
the universality , to repeat , is us — that we are the city .
but that meant that two years before the building was complete , it was already a part of the community , so that when the renderings looked exactly like the finished product , there were no surprises .
when i started this program four years ago , i had this original plan of creating a team of winning underdogs .
it &apos;s better , but nobody .
( fuse blowing ) all right . let &apos;s start with theater .
now , a few years ago , i was a judge on a cooking competition called &quot; &quot; chopped . &quot; &quot; four chefs compete with mystery ingredients to see who can cook the best dishes .
woman : no , i can &apos;t , because he &apos;s blocking pretty much my only way out .
by detecting the odor of particular bacteria , or viruses , or even lung cancer , the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results .

( laughter ) and he said , &quot; &quot; leonardo , were you closer to your mother or your father when you were a kid ? &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; &quot; well , my real hero was my father .
fg : yeah , when he was in rome .
when you think about that , let me go back to what lionel trilling , in his seminal book on authenticity , &quot; &quot; sincerity and authenticity &quot; &quot; — came out in 1960 — points to as the seminal point at which authenticity entered the lexicon , if you will .
in the egyptian delta alone , we &apos;ve excavated less than one-1000th of one percent of the total volume of egyptian sites .
there is so much to do over the next few years that is obvious to so many of us to build a better world .
because you don &apos;t want to get an unfortunate juxtaposition , where you &apos;re talking about one thing instead of the other .
little bit of trickery . and there are the rounded edges on the swimming pool .
and the magic here is , experiment on my avatar in software , not my body in suffering .
i went to afghanistan in 2005 to work on a financial times piece , and there i met kamila , a young women who told me she had just turned down a job with the international community that would have paid her nearly $ 2,000 a month — an astronomical sum in that context .
it was very time-consuming .
i have further results , which are almost unbelievable , of scores which go up with time .
and if avian flu hits , or for any other reason the world decides that malaria is no longer as much of a priority , everybody loses .
that &apos;s my youngest cousin .
and that &apos;s your view of a tomato .
so my first impulse in the face of all of this attention was to become very protective of my own relationship .
( applause ) instead of showing an object from the stage i ’ m going to do something special for the first time .
which is not to say there are no dangers in civilian life ; there are .
it was a precursor to india , a messenger from gondwana — a lost paradise of dinosaurs isolated for millions of years .
and these are actually 15 different typologies i &apos;ve been collecting over time , and it really shows the immense visual diversity of this new metaphor .
it &apos;s not deep poverty . it &apos;s the special situation , probably of concurrent sexual partnership among part of the heterosexual population in some countries , or some parts of countries , in south and eastern africa .
so i am not in any way an exception .
that fixed behavior — which is rigid and stereotyped and ends up with a meal — changes .
the philippines of today has almost the same economy as the united states during the first world war .
what haiti warns us is that rules can be bad because governments are weak .
they are really excelling .
on that measure , we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies .
and i &apos;d like to show you a quick little video about the informal sector , about the boat-building that i , myself , tried to mobilize africans in the diaspora to invest in .
organic chemistry , scaled up in complexity , gives us molecular biology , which of course leads to life itself .
and 9 / 11 has a conspiracy theory . it is a conspiracy .
( laughter ) if you look across fields , the greatest originals are the ones who fail the most , because they &apos;re the ones who try the most .
ladies and gentlemen , that &apos;s my story .

i mean , i have my ranch and everything , but i actually don &apos;t even want to think the day that comes .
ron howard : buzz aldrin came up to me and said , &quot; &quot; hey , that launch footage , i saw some shots i &apos;d never seen before . did you guys , what vault did you find that stuff in ? &quot; &quot; and i said , &quot; &quot; well , no vault , buzz , we generated all that from scratch . &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; huh , that &apos;s pretty good . can we use it ? &quot; &quot; ( explosion ) ( &quot; &quot; sure &quot; &quot; ) ( laughter ) rl : i think he &apos;s a great american .

he said that they have a science behind that art , and they &apos;ve actually created four essential pillars , nine key indicators and 72 different metrics that help them to measure their gnh .
now , you know , i like a quickie as much as the next person , but i think that there &apos;s an awful lot to be gained from slow sex — from slowing down in the bedroom .
this was a very dangerous accusation .
so i have to be very very careful .
within just 50 years — that &apos;s one hundredth of one millionth of the earth &apos;s age — the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise , and ominously fast .
i want them to be perfect so that i can be reassured of my value .
here &apos;s a photograph shot in moonlight , something that digital photography has made a big difference for .
and so this is the existing city , and this is the new city .
but who was the better man , old chum ?
and even though we see a lot of ice in this picture , there &apos;s a lot of water as well , which wasn &apos;t there historically .
and that is what this cylinder is , the declaration made by the ruler guided by god who had toppled the iraqi despot and was going to bring freedom to the people .
so i looked carefully at this guy .
i &apos;ll explain that in just a moment .
it was telling the humans what to do , telling the robots what to do and keeping track of thousands of individual components .
we do need to know who has a stake in trying to shape the outcome of a decision .
there are four girls a little bit older than me .
and so i then moved on into my design career and began to find some exciting things .
its behavior is completely unchanged .
and then i saw the obvious link , because even we liberals love this country .
they must be identical to each other .
now you see me thinking at my kitchen table , and since you &apos;re in my kitchen , please meet my wife .
i can &apos;t show you all the beautiful pictures that we &apos;ve taken in the last two and a half years , because i simply don &apos;t have the time .
the other dog doesn &apos;t have the button .
and he didn &apos;t do all of this in his own name either .
and you can also then put a cap on how much of the world hard drive market are they taking up , which turns out , it &apos;s pretty sizable .
and the media says that it &apos;s really cool if we could go out and be a model or a singer or a sports hero like luongo , crosby .
i was gasping for air .
but surgeons in these eras are a little bit more conservative than their bold , trephinating ancestors .
but first you might be wondering : how is it that an ant can tell , for example , i &apos;m a forager .
and we need to view this , then , as the ultimate deterrent — something we make sure is available , but at the same time , praying we never have to use it .
the music works perfectly in that setting .
and notice , by the way , that most people pick numbers right around there .
but as you go and you look closer at a tree , what you see is , you see increasing complexity .
it is easier than ever to find poems that might stay inside you , that might stay with you , from long , long ago , or from right this minute , from far away or from right close to where you live , almost no matter where you live .
they might say , &quot; &quot; well , with a great education system , maybe 20 or 30 percent . &quot; &quot; but if you fast forward to today , we know that that prediction would have been wildly pessimistic , that pretty close to 100 percent of the population is capable of reading .
( applause ) amanda boxtel : thank you . ( applause )
the entire county is home to just 20,000 people , and they &apos;re very sparsely distributed .
and yet we may not realize that in a standard sedan , of all the fuel energy you feed into the car , seven-eighths never gets to the wheels ; it &apos;s lost first in the engine , idling at zero miles a gallon , the power train and accessories .
let me take you back to that regression line .
they wore makeup , and in fact , they would bond in the ladies &apos; room over eyeliner and eye pencil .
tribes can only hear one level above and below where they are .
and despite all those failures , data is moving rapidly into real-life decision-making — into the workplace , law enforcement , medicine .

anyway — but really , azuri is here as a living reminder that the story of our world is a dynamic one .
a long answer would go like this .
in her essay , &quot; &quot; the white album , &quot; &quot; joan didion writes , &quot; &quot; we tell ourselves stories in order to live .
every time something moves from one place on the register to somewhere else , that asset transfer is time-stamped and publicly recorded on the blockchain .
this is from my second book .
we have created such a situation , artificially , by turning on the critic with a flash of light .
that &apos;s shown down here .
ka : there was no thought of abandoning ship at that point ?
this is why , over time , i have come to call this epidemic of violence the locust effect .
and these are examples of some of the kids &apos; work .
and that line there is a prediction from the same theory , based on the same principles , that describes that forest .
imagine if a team of physicists could stand inside of an atom and watch and hear electrons spin .
ralph waldo emerson called him &quot; a man who does not offend by superiority . &quot;
science has unquestionably made our lives brighter and longer and healthier .
fifty years ago this week , president john f. kennedy made two epoch-making speeches , the first on disarmament and the second on civil rights .
so all these products that you can see on the screen were made in the same way .
they &apos;re like tiny little flies and they fly around .
you need to have the people-people , the communicators , the warm and friendly people who like — ( laughter ) really want to hug you and get you into the community .
but i &apos;m going to end by widening the lens to the entire region to look at the mundane topics of arab views of religion and politics and how this impacts women , revealing some surprises along the way .
you need access to the same phones , devices , connectivity , and even where you don &apos;t , where you can find a proxy agent , usually they require a certain amount of capital to participate .
because it was felt that a school day would last at least eight hours , and you wanted the child to have the ability to use the laptop for at least one full day without having to recharge it .
he was incredibly compassionate in some of his relationships and terribly inadequate in others .
and doing that would amount to shifting from a world that &apos;s driven and run entirely on time spent , to world that &apos;s driven by time well spent .
right ? now those are important things , really important to me , really important to you .
the idea was that we were going to find nuggets or gems of technology that come from other industries like medical imaging , the video game space , and re-appropriate them .
and i find that sort of scary .
we globalized the world . and what does that mean ?
right , the t &amp; a network . then it bought miramax , known for its nc-17 fare , and all of a sudden , families everywhere couldn &apos;t really trust what they were getting from disney .
they have these wacky , cool , crazy , brilliant ideas , and the whole room is just electrified with creative energy .
and there &apos;s a way for us to do that .
that means something built in a city .
so one of the things i look at is , how did the universe begin and shape ?
now , here is another thing which is rather interesting .
and how do we think about materials and structure , sort of as an information and computation problem ?
well , from that discussion grew this program that involved 2,700 scientists from more than 80 countries around the world who engaged in 540 ocean expeditions at a combined cost of 650 million dollars to study the distribution , diversity and abundance of life in the global ocean .
do you go into your board and say , &quot; &quot; look , i &apos;ve got a fantastic idea for an embryonic product in a marginal market , with consumers we &apos;ve never dealt with before , and i &apos;m not sure it &apos;s going to have a big payoff , but it could be really , really big in the future ? &quot; &quot; no , what you do , is you go in and you say , &quot; &quot; i &apos;ve got a fantastic idea for an incremental innovation to an existing product we sell through existing channels to existing users , and i can guarantee you get this much return out of it over the next three years . &quot; &quot; big corporations have an in-built tendency
you should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole .
new york has a program to upgrade its old buildings , make them better insulated in the winter , to not leak energy in the summer , not leak air conditioning . that &apos;s having an impact .
now with all this beauty , usefulness and wealth , mathematics does look more sexy .
this is pretty close to intrinsic beauty . this one , as long as you know what water is like then you can experience this .
so , i &apos;m going to risd , actually .
we can take natural language processing algorithms to kind of read through with a computer , line by line , extracting key concepts from this .
i &apos;ve been in a painful journey .
well , scream buddy is a portable space for screaming .
if a soldier sees his friend blown up , his brain goes into such high alarm that he can &apos;t actually put the experience into words , so he just feels the horror over and over again .
many of you have probably already noticed that i &apos;m chinese .
in addition to accurate language training it also fixes memory and cognition speech fluency and speech production .
when you pump gas , you really don &apos;t think you &apos;re using the internet .
they were wrong . the kids &apos; number one wish ?
so , to find strong evidence of liquid , pools of liquid , beneath the surface of a moon 750 million miles away from the earth is really quite astounding .
part of my interest in this , i have to say , is that i would like to — how do i put this politely ? — change the way , or maybe eviscerate , the capital structure of the u.s. health care system , which i think is fundamentally broken .
and now put the lens over the galaxy , and what you &apos;ll find is that you &apos;ll see a ring , an einstein ring .
so in this environment , interactions are used in the opposite way .
and that &apos;s very powerful to me .
and so because of that belief that i think needs to be burst , i &apos;m here to send us all hurtling back to the truth .
imagine that orchestration .
you just need to step outside , pay attention to what &apos;s so commonplace , so everyday , so mundane that everybody else misses it .
here is a place behind the eyes of those accustomed by what some would call diminishment .
so that &apos;s some supply-side options .
you expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital , probably squeaky clean .
i held myself upright and i fought the urge to close my eyes .
so this currency becomes credit , which again , is really , really interesting .
from grizzly bear in the shower to sigur ros playing in a parisian cafe .
we live in a world in which the most culturally innocuous symbols , like the falafel , can be misunderstood because of baggage , and where religion can be twisted and purposefully made where it &apos;s not supposed to be by others .
and very quickly cajal realized that neurons don &apos;t operate alone , but rather make connections with others that form circuits just like in a computer .
♫ some things you say ♫ ♫ are not for sale ♫ ♫ i would hold it where ♫ ♫ our free agents of some substance are ♫ ♫ scared ♫ ♫ hold still a while ♫ ♫ don &apos;t spill the wine ♫ ♫ i can see it all from here ♫ ♫ i can see ♫ ♫ oh , i ♫ ♫ i can see ♫ ♫ weather systems of the world ♫ ♫ weather systems ♫ ♫ of the world ♫ thanks .
now we understand much better , for example , the kinds of brain areas that go along with the conscious experience of seeing faces or of feeling pain or of feeling happy .
( laughter ) we search at higher energies . we search at higher energies .
it had a gas station , a general store , two houses at its peak . ( laughter )
ms : it &apos;s like , who do i want to be ?
i said schools as we know them now , they &apos;re obsolete .
and let me just read it , the important details here : &quot; &quot; shorthand description , &#91; &apos; hardcore pornography &apos; &#93; ; and perhaps i could never succeed in intelligibly defining it .
and it &apos;s actually a way of playing the game , of playing all the games .
no , no , i didn &apos;t write that .
for over 100 years , neuroanatomists and later neuroscientists held the view that after initial development in childhood , no new brain cells could grow in the adult human brain .
what they remember is , of course , the great triumph , that the brits were beaten , and we won , and that the country was born .
here are some things , the principles that are guiding principles to keep in mind : &quot; &quot; a data-driven health revolution promises to make us all better , faster , and stronger . living by numbers . &quot; &quot; and this one , which is really telling , this was from july , this cover article : &quot; &quot; the personal metrics movement goes way beyond diet and exercise . it &apos;s about tracking every facet of life , from sleep to mood to pain , 24 / 7 / 365 . &quot; &quot; well , i tried this device .
this was just a few days ago in agumbe .
the biggest employer is the purdue chicken processing plant .
sit them in a classroom , tell them about plato at the age of 20 , send them out for a career in management consultancy for 40 years , and that lesson will stick with them .
&#91; &quot; &quot; disruption of political meeting &quot; &quot; &#93; for those who lie , saying they are back with &#91; the party &#93; , your time is running out .
this is the kind of game done by my lab and many around the world .
now , we love to wrap ourselves in lies . we love to do it .
ninety-five percent of that land can only feed people from animals .
and this is how i started my own personal journey in this field of research , working with the christopher and dana reeve foundation .
sign language .
it is said that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence , and i believe this is true , especially when i hear president obama often talk about the korean education system as a benchmark of success .
of course if you want to go inside , the two doors are locked .
but her dream of coal river mountain wind is her legacy .
so here you can see five listeners .
and we &apos;ve done that . now we &apos;ve taken pig ligament — young , healthy , big tissue , put it into 10 patients in an fda-approved trial — and then one of our patients went on to have three canadian masters downhill championships — on his &quot; &quot; pig-lig , &quot; &quot; as he calls it . so we know it can work .
and one of the good things about this cure was that it was free , virtually free , and was very easy to use .
this probably all sounds too good to be true , and you &apos;re right .
so that &apos;s the first problem .
at risd , we have this amazing facility called the edna lawrence nature lab . it has 80,000 samples of animal , bone , mineral , plants .
i think , as i said , essentially terrorism in europe is today a homegrown movement in relation to the global situation that we are facing , and what we need is exactly to prove these groups wrong , by welcoming and integrating effectively those that are coming from that part of the world .
but we did not have the budgets to give that to 15,000 schools , 2 million children .
so basically , no one would accept family planning if their children didn &apos;t survive .
so gays and lesbians have been in society since societies began , but up until the mid-20th century , homosexual acts were still illegal in most states .
first the prey male flashes , &quot; &quot; do you love me ? &quot; &quot; his own female responds , &quot; &quot; maybe . &quot; &quot; so then he flashes again .
and perhaps the best place to start is with my late father .
now i make a daily pilgrimage to visit a particular weeping willow by the seine , and i hunger for the green fields in the bush outside bukavu .
put your tongue away , barry .
it continued to evolve and operated in one form or another on more and more sophisticated computers , until only five years ago .
( laughter ) i have my file which is called to do . i have my plans .
women came out , protested a brutal dictator , fearlessly spoke .
and you understand some things better than other things , and because of that there ’ s a continual jostling and give and take , which is politics .
and to give you an idea of the last fund that kleiner raised was a $ 400 million fund , so this for us is a very substantial fund .
today i want to talk to you about ethnic conflict and civil war .
while there is nothing inherently wrong with a janitorial position , and in fact my forefathers and foremothers were able to attend college because many of their parents worked these jobs , it was a clear attempt to put me in my place .
she knew she would have to marry that old man , and she was 14 .
stage one is literally the culture of gangs and it is the culture of prisons .
just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about .5 .
oh , that &apos;s it .
especially trafficking survivors .
you know . love is great , too .
and in one generation , they &apos;re going from hunger , and all of the detrimental health effects of hunger , to obesity and things like diabetes and heart disease in one generation .
i don &apos;t know about you , but when i see aubrey de grey , i immediately go to gandalf the grey .
and i will do , during those days , whatever it is i was going to do if i had received that piece of news .
you can see the individual structures of the woman .
botswana — upper middle-income country in southern africa , democratic government , good economy , and this is what happened there .
an airplane , when you &apos;re moving in this direction , starts to lift , and that &apos;s how it takes off .
we still have in us this old stuff about superiority and it is causing us to embed those further into our institutions and our society and generations , and it is making for despair and disparities and a devastating devaluing of young black men .
but most of the time , the world &apos;s population is living without real access to arts and culture .
it sounds more inflationary already , doesn &apos;t it .
it &apos;s a letter .
if you had a large red button of this kind , on the wall of your home , and every time you pressed it , it saved 50 dollars for you , put 50 dollars into your pension , you would save a lot more .
or perhaps you &apos;re one of those who &apos;s always yearned for more creativity .
we &apos;re going to explore that a little bit .
this is a story about the fact that people in africa are no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders .
it looks like saturn because , of course , it is .
and here is my brave , brave sister receiving my cells .
and if you actually lose that information , it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind , that you suddenly feel like something &apos;s missing , except you aren &apos;t able to see it , so it feels like a very strange emotion .
and this one had to get broken up .
we created the financial bubble experiment .
the angiogenesis foundation is following almost 300 companies , and there are about 100 more drugs in that pipeline .
and i thought , &quot; &quot; no way , no way . &quot; &quot; and i &apos;m going to admit to hubris .
yr : you feel great , but — ( laughter ) but you have not the right altitude .
now , we know that refined grains and starches elevate your blood sugar in the short run , and there &apos;s even reason to believe that sugar may lead to insulin resistance directly .
in fact , on a good day , we might have four or five human beings at the average depth of the earth — maybe four or five human beings out of whatever billions we &apos;ve got going .
this is a photograph by franz hueber .
td : from the time i was very young , onward , i was given a lot of different responsibilities , and it always seemed to me , when i was young , that everything was laid out before me .
and then we have , of course , as any good scientist has to have , explosions !
in the year 2000 , a rather interesting thing happened .
this is constructed by physical change .
you know , in this process of my sabbatical , i was really reminded of this southern african philosophy of ubuntu .
only a very small percent of those who have a mental illness are violent toward other people , but of those who die by suicide , it &apos;s estimated that about 75 to maybe more than 90 percent have a diagnosable mental health condition of some kind .
and if we don &apos;t find anything at all , we go to museums to see the seeds or wood of trees existing there a long time ago .
i still remember every single detail of that photo .
people talk about the asian economic miracle of the 1980s — but it wasn &apos;t really a miracle .
from poor countries like rwanda to richer countries like new zealand , we see that it &apos;s possible to get lots of social progress , even if your gdp is not so great .
it &apos;s something you live with . it &apos;s something you live in .
they took the eggs and the milk out of the powder .
there is something called pit lamping .
how much corn is being produced ?
this is a calf in captivity making an imitation of that trainer &apos;s whistle .
but , quite frankly , on this issue , there is no other road .
so there &apos;s a lot of reasons to take this 30-year time period as sort of the creation of this new food system .
and these little guys — you could lose many of them .
but not everything was human , and i will give you a very exciting example .
one is , how do you do science autonomy underground ?
if you think about our hands , these tools that are connected to us , and what they &apos;re capable of doing — building houses and furniture , and painting giant murals — and most of the time we hold a controller or a cell phone .
therefore , i could design a circuit that would measure pressure by measuring electrical resistance .
i was once fortunate enough to drive into the high , dark mountains behind los angeles , where the great poet and singer and international heartthrob leonard cohen was living and working for many years as a full-time monk in the mount baldy zen center .
it &apos;s been where i actually see heaven , where i can be happy , where i can be a child again , in dances , through music .
all of the scale goes to coca-cola and burger king .
but it &apos;s the most romantic date ever . and you love it because you don &apos;t hear it .
( laughter ) bear with me .
so me and my friends , we started planet labs to make satellites ultra-compact and small and highly capable .
i had them right at hand .
it would skip a beat .
and then i went in , and measured all the geometry because i figured , hey , biomimicry .
for what is a man ?
or else find the boy who lit the fire in the first place , to see if you can change him .
so depending on the decisions we make in the next few months , the next year or so , if designer baby number one is born , within a few decades , there could well be millions of genetically modified humans .
what is wilderness worth ?
my wife , who is somewhere in the audience today , called me up at the office and said , &quot; &quot; nigel , you need to pick our youngest son &quot; &quot; — harry — &quot; &quot; up from school . &quot; &quot; because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening .
so filling the gap between explanation and a weird act with stories — that &apos;s indeed what contemporary art is all about .
in many ways , we &apos;ve been taught to think that the real question is , do people deserve to die for the crimes they &apos;ve committed ?
the blood drains from her face .
and we have a cool atmosphere .
i had all kinds of rats , mice , hamsters , gerbils , squirrels .
but now let &apos;s apply that to systems diseases like cancer .
this is paldin .
he &apos;s 14 and he anticipated a governmental project by one year . ( applause ) or again , another project where , by analyzing the twitter feed of a family , you can basically point where they are , like in the &quot; &quot; harry potter &quot; &quot; movie .
before the 2030s happen , we &apos;ll have it .
we can only blame ourselves . over the last 50 years the design and construction industry has gotten much more complex and has gotten much more litigious .
but in china they look generation after generation because they remember the very embarrassing period , for 100 years , when they went backwards .
( laughter ) what is it like when you take a feeble little noseful of air ?
and i finally bounced through high school , got into the city college of new york with a 78.3 average , which i shouldn &apos;t have been allowed in with , and then i started out in engineering , and that only lasted six months . ( laughter ) and then i went into geology , &quot; &quot; rocks for jocks . &quot; &quot; this is easy .
