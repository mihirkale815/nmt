I graduated from university to become a theater director , and that progress is entirely to do with the fact that people I &apos;ll never meet fought for women to have rights , get the vote , get education , have progress .

The question of whether disgust ought to influence our moral and political judgments certainly has to be complex , and might depend on exactly what judgments we &apos;re talking about , and as a scientist , we have to conclude sometimes that the scientific method is just ill-equipped to answer these sorts of questions .

So who would think that it was low-fat ?
Even in the midst of terrible destruction and death and chaos , I learned how ordinary people could help their neighbors , share food , raise their children , drag someone who &apos;s being sniped at from the middle of the road even though you yourself were endangering your life , helping people get into taxis who were injured to try to take them to hospitals .
And this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences .
If you did , could you please raise your hand ?
I set out to write a compelling economic story , one that had great characters , that no one else was telling , and one that I thought mattered .

When we think about how we address problems in this country , we often start from a place of trickle-down justice .
Arabs were saving Jews . Jews were saving Arabs .
That &apos;s always been the harder problem when it comes to fighting wars .

If we didn &apos;t have this present moment , we wouldn &apos;t have any opportunity to do anything or experience anything , and this moment is a gift .
So , all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them , and I think as designers we need to really think about how we can create a different relationship between our work and the world , whether it &apos;s for business , or , as I &apos;m going to show , on some civic-type projects .

They truly perform as they transform through time and as communities negotiate the spaces and boundaries and resources .
This satellite covers the whole of Africa and goes back as far as 1984 , and that &apos;s important , because if you know how many times a place has had a drought in the last 30 years , you can make a pretty good estimate what the chances are of drought in the future , and that means that you can put a price tag on the risk of drought .
We put waste water and some source of CO2 into our floating structure , and the waste water provides nutrients for the algae to grow , and they sequester CO2 that would otherwise go off into the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas .

Now imaginative people have been having fun with this for over 400 years .
I use planet Earth to go in very extreme environments where conditions were similar to those of Mars at the time when the climate changed , and there I &apos;m trying to understand what happened .
It &apos;s pressure from the human population hunting and destroying their habitats which has done so .
But as the social researcher Charles Murray has documented , as we started to automate the economy , and 1960 is just about when computers started to be used by businesses , as we started to progressively inject technology and automation and digital stuff into the economy , the fortunes of Bill and Ted diverged a lot .

Second question : what causes these changes ?
We &apos;ve watched the financial markets that we uniquely create — these markets that were supposed to be foolproof — we &apos;ve watched them kind of collapse before our eyes .

A momentous thing that can happen to a culture is they can acquire a new style of arguing : trial by jury , voting , peer review , now this . Right ?
Its closest relative is , in fact , from mice , and so we would call this a xenotropic retrovirus , because it &apos;s infecting a species other than mice .
And in the life that everyone sees , who I am is a friend , a son , a brother , a stand-up comedian and a teenager .

Now we have taken on a second thing , and this gets to my wish .
It is February and not lying is impossible . &quot; &quot; And I really spend a lot of time wondering , how much truth do we tell ?
( Laughter ) But that &apos;s the work I &apos;m doing with BioSentient Corporation trying to figure out how do we integrate these things ?
There &apos;s no dynamic , there &apos;s no highs or lows , if everything is awesome .
This is just the grassroots stuff again , OK ?
This is a pretty involved process ; it took us about four and a half years .
And all of you need to have it embedded in your brains and to organize yourselves around it .
He took owl monkeys , wired them up so that a computer watched their brains while they moved , especially looking at the movement of their right arm .
His current obsession is to leave Lebanon at any cost — even if it meant embarking on a hazardous journey along with refugees drifting towards Europe today through the Mediterranean .
I am a nomadic artist .
Rather than just cutting costs , you need to think about initiatives that will enable you to win in the medium term , initiatives to drive growth , actions that will fundamentally change the way the company operates , and very importantly , investments to develop the leadership and the talent .

And so sometimes these analogous experiences , analogous role-play , can also be quite valuable .
Just in the past couple years , we &apos;ve seen digital tools display skills and abilities that they never , ever had before , and that kind of eat deeply into what we human beings do for a living .

The results of this kind of work are simple and they &apos;re powerful .
It &apos;s so amazing , it &apos;s so exciting .
And they grow and grow by stages . And they climb out of the water , burst out , as the adult which we see .
And so they did something that &apos;s really radical , when you think about how government is used to working .
Governments get elected , and then they fall below 50 percent approval in a few months and stay there and get worse until the next election .
So our children are getting larger , but at the same time we are growing into different directions .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s in all seven continents , including Antarctica .
In Britain , it could mean looking to the French , learning from the French , getting directly elected mayors in place in a French commune system .
Metal peppered his face .
But what I &apos;d like to talk about today is the fact that this morning , about a billion people on Earth — or one out of every seven — woke up and didn &apos;t even know how to fill this cup .
One billion grains of sand come into existence in the world each second .
So as an academic , we &apos;re always trained to be able to jump through hoops to raise funding for our labs , and we get our robots to do that .
We &apos;ve seen what happens when we divide an already small planet into smaller islands .
I think that Torajans socially recognize and culturally express what many of us feel to be true despite the widespread acceptance of the biomedical definition of death , and that is that our relationships with other humans , their impact on our social reality , doesn &apos;t cease with the termination of the physical processes of the body , that there &apos;s a period of transition as the relationship between the living and the dead is transformed but not ended .
In this talk today , I want to present a different idea for why investing in early childhood education makes sense as a public investment .
There &apos;s a lot of information here .
So I started doubting myself and wondering what was the real purpose of this whole project ?
It was in far western New South Wales .
And we don &apos;t even know the shape of the language .
It should be thought of as a biological moonshot with a timetable .
( Laughter ) Of course it &apos;s meant to be funny , but in all seriousness , suicidal ideation is quite common with traumatic brain injuries .

So suppose your goal is to get kids into school .
So we can now , in a matter of hours , determine a whole human genome .
But frankly there are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from NYU , have them go study for a semester at the University of Arkansas , and vice versa . Do it at the high school level .
Why ? Why do we have to be left out ?
That &apos;s what your genes are doing every day .
You can imagine what it was like in the winter at 10,000 feet .

I mean , it &apos;s the same story . It &apos;s just different names .
In my experience , in fact , the light footprint was extremely helpful .
Now , in a word , the answer is &quot; &quot; rules . &quot; &quot; Bad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that &apos;s available when people can bring new technologies in and make them available to someone like Nelson .
Animals are not just raw materials .
All right .
And the Hell Creek Project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find , and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them .
So today what you have is what I call the middle 40 percent , the people who are not in the top 10 and who are not in the bottom 50 , and what you can view as the wealth middle class that owns 20 to 30 percent of total wealth , national wealth , whereas they used to be poor , a century ago , when there was basically no wealth middle class .
If you look at the scene , Egypt , for 30 years , had been in a downhill — going into a downhill .
And let me give you a few illustrations .
And so I can generate a force feedback .
And there &apos;s five or six different compilations there , But each one of those compilations reflects input from hundreds of these kinds of records from corals .
But I do think it &apos;s an important conversation .
So it blinks one second after you do .
If you look up high enough , you could see me .
( Laughter ) Which isn &apos;t a great idea .
And this brings us to our third part of the exercise , which is to draw how to make toast , but this time in a group .
In fact , in Go , there are more possible moves than there are atoms in the universe .
We &apos;ve shared transportation .
And then 10 years from now , billions will again have gone into Africa , and we would still have the same problems .
And we might be able to find evidence of our own origin in the most unlikely place , and this place in Mars .
Instead of thinking about what to build , building in order to think .
So I hope there aren &apos;t too many psychologists in this audience .
But online , everybody speaks at the same speed .
We surround ourselves with people who feel the same way we do , and we approve each other , and that &apos;s a really good feeling .
Number two : free trade .
We also studied Vineet Nayar at HCL Technologies , an Indian outsourcing company .

Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert , and this happens only when we create too much bare ground .
After the final &quot; &quot; no &quot; &quot; comes a &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; When any great moral challenge is ultimately resolved into a binary choice between what is right and what is wrong , the outcome is fore-ordained because of who we are as human beings .

This is Gen9 gene assembler , and so right now when you try to print a gene , what you do is somebody in a factory with pipettes puts the thing together by hand , you have one error per 100 base pairs , and it takes a long time and costs a lot of money .
And so while other kids were BBM-ing their parents , I was literally waiting by the mailbox to get a letter from home to see how the weekend had gone , which was a little frustrating when Grandma was in the hospital , but I was just looking for some sort of scribble , some unkempt cursive from my mother .

So it &apos;s the same way , like those action video games have a number of ingredients that are actually really powerful for brain plasticity , learning , attention , vision , etc . , and so we need and we &apos;re working on understanding what are those active ingredients so that we can really then leverage them to deliver better games , either for education or for rehabilitation of patients .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Go read it . &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Oh , that one wasn &apos;t so awesome . &quot; &quot; And then we went to another one — it didn &apos;t have great visuals , but it had great information — and spent an hour talking about the learning process , because it wasn &apos;t about whether or not it was perfect , or whether or not it was what I could create .
And then at my worst moments : Why did I make such a stupid mistake ?

And Richard Meier , who was one of my teachers , kept coming over to my desk to give me criticism , and he would say , &quot; &quot; Bill , you &apos;ve got to understand- — solar energy has nothing to do with architecture . &quot; &quot; I guess he didn &apos;t read Vitruvius .
You can find it on the East Coast as well as the West Coast , and often the symbols are very well preserved , so each of these symbols has four bits — it &apos;s a four-bit binary word — you draw these lines in the sand randomly , and then you count off , and if it &apos;s an odd number , you put down one stroke , and if it &apos;s an even number , you put down two strokes .
If our airplane is too heavy , if the pilot wastes energy , we &apos;ll never make it through the night .

In fact , everybody in this room probably , especially if you picked up your bag — some of you , I know , didn &apos;t pick up your bags — but if you picked up your bag , everybody in this room has got in their pocket , or back in their room , something that 350 years ago , kings would have gone to war to have .
And this is a place where people not only reach age 100 , they do so with extraordinary vigor .
DH : Now obviously , this is not something we do on our regular show ; it &apos;s something we just kind of learned for this , so we &apos;re going to try . But can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs ?
It reminded me a lot of the talk we heard this morning , about this operating room machinery that was designed specifically for Africa .

RL : So there are , when our legitimate foreign intelligence targets of the type that I described before , use the global telecommunications system as their communications methodology , and they do , because it &apos;s a great system , it &apos;s the most complex system ever devised by man , and it is a wonder , and lots of folks in the room there are responsible for the creation and enhancement of that , and it &apos;s just a wonderful thing .
So it turns out that being paid less and praised less has its upsides — for society at least .
In about four months of release , we &apos;ve brought that population of mosquitos — in most cases we &apos;re dealing with villages here of about 2,000 , 3,000 people , that sort of size , starting small — we &apos;ve taken that mosquito population down by about 85 percent in about four months .

That &apos;s an inconvenience compared to having both of them gone . &quot; &quot; I got a day job , and my nights and weekends are already filled up with things like , let &apos;s supply water to the world , and power to the world , and educate all the kids , which , Chris , I will not talk about .

I &apos;m taking data from the U.N. — it &apos;s the same as the World Bank has — on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies .
The logarithmic scale hides the scale of the increase , because this represents trillions-fold increase since the 1890 census .

This ain &apos;t going to be my last movie .
We are talking here about , oftentimes , very young individuals with spinal cord injuries , that in the prime of their life — 20s , 30s , 40s — hit a wall and the wheelchair &apos;s the only option .

Ten years ago , however , the promise of democracy seemed to be extraordinary . George W. Bush stood up in his State of the Union address in 2003 and said that democracy was the force that would beat most of the ills of the world .

All other species on this planet are gene machines only , they don &apos;t imitate at all well , hardly at all .
And I said , first of all , let me do the calculation on that compound , bottom right , which is related to coumarin , but has an extra pentagon inserted into the molecule .

And this is the same thing you see when people compress video to send : they want to make it very sparse , because that file is smaller . And this is what the retina is doing , and it &apos;s doing it just with the circuitry , and how this network of neurons that are interacting in there , which we &apos;ve captured on the chip .
What is this about ?
But dragonflies — a bit tricky .
Over the Spanish Steps we go .
I find this a particularly apt description of science and how science works — bumbling around in a dark room , bumping into things , trying to figure out what shape this might be , what that might be , there are reports of a cat somewhere around , they may not be reliable , they may be , and so forth and so on .
Coke &apos;s been in Africa since 1928 , but most of the time they couldn &apos;t reach the distant markets , because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world , which was a large truck rolling down the street .

So what we found is that the bursts last long enough in order to support wave resonances , which are things caused by exchanges of energy between particles that may have been excited , that depend on the volume .
Every time we lead one of these efforts we have to whip ourselves into this imminent threat thing .
And the women decided that they would train not the next generation of girls , because they had grown too old already , but the next generation .

I mean , it &apos;s a hobby of mine that I &apos;ve been indulging in for the last few years , and it all started out with this picture of the American artist , Donald Baechler I had hanging at home . I had to look at it every day and after a while I just couldn &apos;t stand the mess anymore this guy was looking at all day long .

So , looking for answers , I went to Catholic mass .
Okay . So I &apos;m smiling .
And it has this constant voiceover narrative in your stream of conscious thinking .
Remember that we scanned both brains at the same time , so we can ask about time-synced activity in similar or different areas simultaneously , just like if you wanted to study a conversation and you were scanning two people talking to each other and you &apos;d expect common activity in language regions when they &apos;re actually kind of listening and communicating .
( Applause )
And that would be very interesting in the developing world .
We C.T.-scanned all of our bones and built a digital Spinosaurus skeleton .

And doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients , but now this will change .
Is there a way we can show people food in a way they have not seen it before ?

( Applause )
That &apos;s the twelfth one .
And this is continuing and continuing and continuing .
And four , a global recession that has fundamentally shocked consumer behaviors .
If we do not lift up the women who played critical roles in these struggles , we fail to offer up role models to future generations .

But there &apos;s an important thing to remember here : even though companies pushed back , even though companies demanded , hey , let &apos;s do this through a warrant process , let &apos;s do this where we actually have some sort of legal review , some sort of basis for handing over these users &apos; data , we saw stories in the Washington Post last year that weren &apos;t as well reported as the PRISM story that said the NSA broke in to the data center communications between Google to itself and Yahoo to itself .
( Laughter ) But actually , the most impressive thing to me is that — well , actually , I would also like to say this for all children is to say thank you to all adults , for actually caring for us a lot , and to make our future world much better .
So , where do we go from here ?
So one has got to discover a certain wholeness .

And we &apos;ve already started construction on section two .
But dragonflies are not the only creatures that make the crossing .

And when someone wants to rent a room , they go onto the blockchain database and all the criteria , they sift through , it helps them find the right room , and then the blockchain helps with the contracting , it identifies the party , it handles the payments just through digital payments — they &apos;re built into the system .

And I &apos;m a very nerdy doctor , so I read all of the studies that I could on this drug . I read the one study that was published that showed that reboxetine was better than placebo , and I read the other three studies that were published that showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other antidepressant , and because this patient hadn &apos;t done well on those other antidepressants , I thought , well , reboxetine is just as good . It &apos;s one to try .
Why is it a disease of the aged ?
Let &apos;s look at a couple of quick examples .

And if our sun has planets — Mercury , Venus , Earth , Mars , etc . , surely those other stars should have planets also , and they do .
I figure about half of that are men , so that takes the number down to 750,000 .
But we do provide on that website a standardized list of definitions , because it &apos;s hard to attack a behavior in the right way if we &apos;re not all sharing a definition of what that behavior is .
&quot; That &apos;s right , &quot; it said , &quot; I am YouTube . &quot;
And the Marrow Miner , the way it works is shown here .
He &apos;s still waiting for his funeral in Norway , and none of his family will be able to attend .
One of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet .
So get peacekeepers there , but get them home as soon as possible .
And the collective has enabled me to form collaborations with a whole array of interesting people .
So I made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life , and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse — the subject of martyrdom , the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection of love of God , faith , but violence and crime and cruelty .
Impressive . Thank you .

Pew Research polls Chinese public attitudes , and here are the numbers in recent years .

And a small group of thoughtful people changed that bay .
We are going to need a new generation of citizen leaders willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning as rapidly as possible .

And it just disturbed me so much .
You see these cars that drive up — usually it &apos;s Saabs and Audis and Volvos , because in certain neighborhoods it &apos;s socially acceptable to have a luxury car , so long as it comes from a country hostile to U.S. foreign policy — that &apos;s fine .
So I started thinking about peace , and I was obviously , as I said to you , very much moved by these images , trying to make sense of that .
And I feel that we have a special connection , which I value very much .
They seem cleverer .
I spent ages flying this flight simulator , and I honestly believed I could fly airplanes by the end of it .

Well in surgery , you couldn &apos;t have people who are more specialized and you couldn &apos;t have people who are better trained .
If you just run the simulation , it will just collapse , like this .
And this is the ability to program physical and biological materials to change shape , change properties and even compute outside of silicon-based matter .
I remember one particularly low moment .
And the maps of violence in most U.S. cities looked like this .
They are not meant to stay .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So we are natural-born dualists .
So what does play do for the brain ?
This has to be described as an adventure , not a burden .
Alzheimer &apos;s disease : there &apos;s five million people affected , and you can check vital signs , activity , balance .
And you start to see things .

What will we know ? What will we learn ?
So why are screens so pervasive in our analog life ?

One can become an object of public ridicule because of a misplaced B.
It &apos;s not one of these statistics which is very doubtful .
You sell your products more expensively .
And the large companies , they typically have wonderful wellness programs , but the medium-sized companies that typically fall between the cracks on issues like this , they started to get engaged and used our program as a model for their own employees to try and have contests to see who might be able to deal with their obesity situation in a way that could be proactively beneficial to others .
We &apos;re going to learn how to make one flap .
I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh gracious , if these two players , either one of them &quot; &quot; — they were different years , but I thought about each one at the time he was there — &quot; &quot; Oh , if he ever makes the varsity , our varsity must be pretty miserable , if he &apos;s good enough to make it . &quot; &quot; And you know , one of them was a starting player for a season and a half .
So the train is now pulling into the third stop along the 6 line .
And another story of the cylinder begins .
You &apos;re seeing a plot .
As a scientist , I always wanted to measure that resonance , that sense of the other that happens so quickly , in the blink of an eye .
Thinking , how can that be ? You &apos;re cheating . The lines are curved .
Secondly , in the Communist ideology , there &apos;s no place for criticism .
( Applause )
Again , chiming with your view that China has a militarized regime ready to , you know , mobilize its enormous forces .
This is a spectacular coral garden .
All right . I understand . If you &apos;re unwilling to — All right , well , we can discuss that after class .
I was not a great student .
But because so many of the issues in education aren &apos;t just in school , they &apos;re in family and community , what you also need , definitely , is more on the right hand side .
Imagine that that Earth is at the center of the universe , and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere .
You are somebody who wants to make a difference .

Once we &apos;ve discovered somebody has low vision , the next big challenge is to work out why , and to be able to do that , we need to have access to the inside of the eye .
There are different programs for graduate students , for executives at different companies .
And I wonder what he &apos;s soaking in .
I particularly like the little Linux penguin in the back . ( Laughter ) So one of the things that that &apos;s leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion .
The first paradox is that growing up is about rejecting the past and then promptly reclaiming it .
To just bring them to justice . &quot; &quot; But of course , they don &apos;t listen .
I should be able to ask my house where my shoes are .
So like the periodic table , we came up with our own table of the elements : new lifeforms that were computationally grown , additively manufactured and biologically augmented .
Here &apos;s the MR. It provides the framework .
The closer one gets , the more new features one discovers .
But there &apos;s also another problem from ships that I &apos;m illustrating here , and that &apos;s the problem of collision .
And to me this was a key component that somehow , through this medium of photography , which allows us to contemplate these landscapes , that I thought photography was perfectly suited to doing this type of work .
And there &apos;s a difference there too , because if we , you in the audience , or I , if we decide to have a designer baby , then their children will also be genetically modified , and so on , because it &apos;s heritable .
My head snapped back over my red seat .
That was designed on that machine , in the woods behind the Institute .
What I want to do more generally is to get you thinking about the place of uncertainty and randomness and chance in our world , and how we react to that , and how well we do or don &apos;t think about it .
He was strong , steady , disciplined .
I found this one watering hole , and felt if everything remained the same way it was behaving , I had a real opportunity to capture something unique .
( Laughter ) So I &apos;m sorry about that .
We &apos;re talking about energy .
It &apos;s fundamental to Darwin and Mendel and so on .
Thank you very much indeed . ( Applause )
Our city is very spread out .
I &apos;m going to argue that , in fact , business strategy has always been premised on assumptions about technology , that those assumptions are changing , and , in fact , changing quite dramatically , and that therefore what that will drive us to is a different concept of what we mean by business strategy .
I &apos;m a corporate lawyer most of the time for an organization called Enablis that supports entrepreneurs in South Africa .
And that &apos;s a little image of the tree of Stansted .
That all seems like win to me .
And I fell into those thousands of connections that I &apos;d made , and I asked my crowd to catch me .
There was no place to stay , so I stuck my computer in , I went away , came back after a couple of months , found kids playing games on it .
So , describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt . Go ahead .
And it &apos;s a rare fungus .
Principle number two : we have to recognize and celebrate diversity in this stuff .
However , huge supercomputer analyses , done of the likely effectiveness of this , show that it won &apos;t buy us much time at all .
What you &apos;ve done makes people laugh and then think .
And they know how to bring it back because they have demystified one big myth , which is the myth of spontaneity , which is that it &apos;s just going to fall from heaven while you &apos;re folding the laundry like a deus ex machina , and in fact they understood that whatever is going to just happen in a long-term relationship , already has .
So the idea is that we get the speed and efficiency benefits of using these physical dials together with the flexibility and versatility of a system that &apos;s designed in software .
So , there &apos;s plenty of non-zero-sumness .
Should one of them stop working or reduce hours to be home ?
In other words , they mastered the art of doing more with less , which is the essence of frugal innovation .
Left home .
So I think that actually step two , that I called a step a moment ago , isn &apos;t a step at all .
What am I doing this for ?
And a variety of other studies have shown that the microbial community that lives in and on us helps in development of the immune system , helps in fighting off pathogens , helps in our metabolism , and determining our metabolic rate , probably determines our odor , and may even shape our behavior in a variety of ways .
But unfortunately , he died prematurely in 1970 , and so he wasn &apos;t really able to live that dream completely .
It makes use of the GPS — you &apos;re familiar with GPS in your automobile , but you may not be familiar with the fact that there &apos;s a GPS U.S. , there &apos;s a Russian GPS , and there &apos;s a new GPS system going to Europe , called Galileo .
You know , that &apos;s not good enough .
It &apos;s even on thongs , but compressed to &quot; &quot; How about never — is never good for you ? &quot; &quot; Now these look like very different forms of humor but actually they bear a great similarity .
They said , one , the bridge doesn &apos;t exist .
If you go on , that &apos;s a slightly more complicated program that &apos;s now doing all sorts of algorithmic things and creating user interface and so on .
So I sent a cold email to info @ equaljusticeintiative.org : &quot; &quot; Dear Bryan , &quot; &quot; it said , &quot; &quot; I think your building project is maybe the most important project we could do in America and could change the way we think about racial injustice .

We find that if we get them out of institutions and into loving families early on , they recover their developmental delays , and go on to lead normal , happy lives .
Is it something as obvious as that jealousy , which boils down into person , desire , impediment , is such a solid narrative foundation ?
The experts call this the Girl Effect .
And before we have the debate , I &apos;d like to actually take a show of hands — on balance , right now , are you for or against this ?
For every dollar given to a women &apos;s program , 20 dollars are given to men &apos;s programs .
And what have you always wanted to ask someone from the other side ?
When the terrorist incidents occurred in the United Kingdom a couple of years ago , I think even though they didn &apos;t claim as many lives as we lost in the United States on 9 / 11 , I think the thing that troubled the British most was that the perpetrators were not invaders , but homegrown citizens whose religious and political identities were more important to them than the people they grew up with , went to school with , worked with , shared weekends with , shared meals with .
( Laughter ) If you put it next to contemporary architecture , it feels totally natural to me .
So I just want to welcome all of you onto the ride .
And it was through crowd-sourcing , it was through the kindness that strangers were showing me , that I could uncover parts of my past that were haunting me .
I &apos;ve been at this for 30 years , and in that time I &apos;ve seen the ability , the commitment , the will of government to do this decline , and I don &apos;t see them making a comeback right now .
I lived with incredible birds , incredible animals , I swam in our small rivers with our caimans .
And we keep setting our expectations higher and higher .
So don &apos;t hang on till the bitter end .
Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
But every generation has the chance to make it better .
And I &apos;m not going to take them somewhere and say , one day all of this will be yours .
They start at the surface of the brain , and then they dive down into the tissue itself , and as they spread out , they supply nutrients and oxygen to each and every cell in the brain .
What we want is to make sure that those individuals with autism can be free from the devastating consequences that come with it at times , the profound intellectual disabilities , the lack of language , the profound , profound isolation .
A-rhythm-etic . Audience : A-rhythm-etic .
They &apos;ve bounded the city with a line .
The president of Ethiopia said he would do it .
Naghma lived in a refugee camp with her parents and her eight brothers and sisters .
CA : So that seems like a win for the consumer .
So my moment of truth did not come all at once .
This is a very nice pattern , and it &apos;s true , because 5 + 5 = 2 • 5 , etc .
But it also tells us something about policy .
So you &apos;ve got a lot of information . That &apos;s great .
Now it &apos;s all done on my iPhone , and it all goes straight up to my server , and my server does all the backend work and categorizes things and puts everything together .
They are the slaves .
And yet what we proved then is the U.S. has more market power than OPEC .
How do we get that to a million ?
And he wished me luck and he gave me some free books and he showed me out the door .
By that I mean , not just the choice to use a gene drive , but also the choice not to use one .
Let me step back and take a look at why the city is so good for the blind .
That component is that we cannot be attached to outcome .
CA : Wait , wait , wait , not doing anything ?
We can also magnify small mechanical movements , like vibrations in engines , that can help engineers detect and diagnose machinery problems , or see how our buildings and structures sway in the wind and react to forces .
I went to Congo with MSF , and contributed to a book and an exhibition that focused attention on a forgotten war in which millions of people have died , and exposure to disease without treatment is used as a weapon .
And none of this takes more money and none of this demands a bureaucracy , but it does demand that you think things differently and you are prepared to bend budgets and work programs in order to create that supportive framework that communities can bounce off .
Except it &apos;s supposed to be brown .
Here , instead of through the lens of a genome , through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record .
( Laughter ) So , I couldn &apos;t let myself feel condescending towards these boys .
Now , David builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab , but before he does that , he works with dancers to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place .
Now , the best way of ending human suffering caused by war is to never go to war .
So let &apos;s start off by defining some terms .
You leave aside what is natural to be natural .
So when we went through the numbers , and just added that up — how much nuclear do we see China and India bringing online over the next 15 years , how much do we see at risk of being taken offline — this was the most startling finding .
Few high schoolers had access to computers in those days .
And that is , of course , Europe .
But of course , Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy .
In different contexts , cells do different things .
The life of a small-shareholder farmer is miserable .
And as you &apos;ll notice , it &apos;s still pretty gosh darn fast slowed down 333 times . It &apos;s an incredibly powerful movement .
In situations where you can &apos;t go about thinking how you &apos;d reverse this feeling of injustice , you can still think , maybe not what you can do , but what you can not do .
I blush whenever I show this .
So if this theory were true then it meant that light as it passed the sun should actually be bent around it .
Some of that &apos;s good : Oxfam , a great non-governmental actor .
And I have a volunteer subject in the audience today , Julie .
And in fact , if you compare it to data , it fits very well with the development of cities and economies .
And this is an excerpt from my first editor &apos;s letter , where I say that Rookie , we don &apos;t have all the answers , we &apos;re still figuring it out too , but the point is not to give girls the answers , and not even give them permission to find the answers themselves , but hopefully inspire them to understand that they can give themselves that permission , they can ask their own questions , find their own answers , all of that , and Rookie , I think we &apos;ve been trying to make it a nice place for all of that to be figured out .
And experience is not just a kind of entertainment in a non-casual way .
And who &apos;s responsible ? Designers .
And Yamaha makes an incredible thing called the Disklavier Pro that looks like a nice grand piano there .
It can be deadly .
So whatever you get that can make you happy can go away .
It &apos;s a very frightening , very , very frightening thought .
It is the same in the 21st century . That &apos;s why I am going to decide to give this machine only for poor women across India .
I remember a journal article about this new question answering software that had a graph .
Instead , she said , &quot; &quot; No , no . Work and leisure can be together . &quot; &quot; Yeah , that &apos;s particularly gorgeous — it &apos;s the TV dinner of 2001 .
It &apos;s out in the middle of the Pacific , right around the Equator .
So there was only one possibility — to bring the column out of the computer .
I hope when you learn things , like about how the natural world works — I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper or you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child .

The inventors don &apos;t know what the invention is .
This is the most disruptive technology — I &apos;ve been told by executives of the pesticide industry — that they have ever witnessed .

of my four-and-a-half-year commandship in that district , three years in , after putting pastors in the car with my police because I knew this — it &apos;s a little secret — I knew this : it was hard to stay a nasty police officer while you &apos;re riding around with a clergy .
Now the first interface is called a DriveGrip .
People &apos;s moral values , they &apos;re their most deeply held beliefs .
Thank you .
So what happens if you start to explain space to them ?

Now , Sylvia Browne is the big operator .
The conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold was able to learn .
I stay . If I go , I will be killed .
And by rating it and by rating the different people who submit information , we can get refined results and weighted results .

I was at the top of the General Assembly just looking down into it and seeing it happen .
She looks at me like I &apos;m her , you know , her moron child , the cretin , the one she &apos;s got to speak to very slowly and distinctly .
And so that &apos;s what makes me lie awake at night , I guess , you know .
There are people now online that are friends ; they &apos;ve never met .
Now I have carefully cropped this sequence to be exactly the duration of a human eye blink , so in the time that it would take you to blink your eye , the fly has seen this looming predator , estimated its position , initiated a motor pattern to fly it away , beating its wings at 220 times a second as it does so .
Lots of people are used to having a spiritual tribe , or a church tribe , having a work tribe , having a community tribe .
If I zoom on it , you can see : that &apos;s the Rover on the surface .

( Laughter ) Every country is different and it &apos;s confusing , okay ?
And in the intervening years I had two daughters .
And now , brrrrrrrrrr , just like when you were a kid .
It was complex , but there was something capricious about its complexity .
But that doesn &apos;t mean we shouldn &apos;t do everything in our power to protect the environments that we rely and depend on , and like Everest , the remote location and inadequate infrastructure of the orbital environment make waste disposal a challenging problem .
And that &apos;s also a higher hurdle . People drop out .
Audience : 1966 .
To the top right of the graph , are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well-being , but they &apos;re using a lot of planet to get there .
So the next time a victim of a privacy violation comes up to you , instead of blaming them , let &apos;s do this instead : let &apos;s shift our ideas about digital privacy , and let &apos;s respond with compassion .
But it &apos;s still true that a neuron , a nerve cell , looks the same in a crayfish , a bird or you .
He would promote the policeman immediately , so that P.C. Bloggs became Detective Inspector Bloggs in the course of the conversation and wave us on merrily .
Let &apos;s see by a show of hands .
Why don &apos;t we see more innovation in sanitation ?
But we can let that insecurity make us brittle or supple .
It &apos;s a simple choice , so we &apos;ve worked for many years with the Forest Stewardship Council , with literally hundreds of other organizations , and there &apos;s a point here about collaboration .

And here &apos;s an example .
The issue of privacy and personal data is much bigger than just the government , and so learn the facts .
When this happened to me 17 years ago , there was no name for it .
And when I have the question , it is a focus .
Take a look at Gabby .
The landscape has sadly become much more populated with instances like mine , whether or not someone actually make a mistake , and now it &apos;s for both public and private people .
So , the tiger is the icon .
And we have to resist to the changes .
And one of the first things that we discovered that I think is really helpful for understanding polarization is to understand that the political divide in our country is undergirded by a deeper moral divide .
And when the sun shines , you get copious quantities of these things , called neutrinos , pouring out .
Crossing miles and miles of sastrugi — frozen ice snowdrifts that could be hip-deep .
But what you do know is that that introduction was nothing short of transformative .
One of my viewer &apos;s uncles died on a particular day and he chose to commemorate it with a piece of hate .
I &apos;ve met a lot of them .
If she is married to a man she doesn &apos;t like or if she is married to an old man , she has to accept , because she does not want to be dubbed as disobedient .

( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) SB : We ended up at what was advertised as the world &apos;s largest speed dating event .
So there is this key benefit that is relevant to state policy makers in terms of economic development .
The thing that caused massive policy changes to occur was Race to the Top for education .
And we learn and adapt the program accordingly .
And that was the job of the journalist . It was filtering all this stuff .
They are all remodeled . They all become specialized for the task at hand .
Quite nice in itself , they &apos;re little , sort of , airplane things .

When you have a non-stick pan , it costs about , maybe , 250 rupees , five dollars , six dollars .
Eighty-five to 95 percent of species at this time die out , and simultaneous to that is a huge , dramatic spike in carbon dioxide , that a lot of scientists agree comes from a simultaneous eruption of volcanoes and a runaway greenhouse effect .
It means that you can &apos;t get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so much .
Is it a part of a circle ?
We feel awkward and shameful talking about it .
DP : When a guy is happily married , no matter what happens at work , no matter what happens in the rest of the day , there &apos;s a shelter when you get home , there &apos;s a knowledge knowing that you can hug somebody without them throwing you downstairs and saying , &quot; &quot; Get your hands off me . &quot; &quot; Being married is like having a color television set .

CA : But to make this happen , you have to look at each part in the chain — the police , who else ?
I also see a world where we can erase unwanted memories .
But it &apos;s also useful , because it tells us that extreme simplicity in movement rules at the individual level can result in a great deal of complexity at the level of the group .
Bia &apos;s school stayed in place .
But let &apos;s start off by remembering that Darwin showed how we &apos;re the outcome of four billion years of evolution .
It was around this time we went from 1K to 16K , which was quite the leap .
Now , like Doc Edgerton , a scientist himself , science became art — an art of ultra-fast photography .
( Applause )
For every four barrels of oil that we consume , we only discover one .
The more I thought about it , I realized , no , it &apos;s still important .
And in just four weeks , the brain learns to process this new sensation and acquires a new sensory pathway — like a new sense .
It gives it information . By adding information to matter , it gives it a function that &apos;s different than without that structure .
But we also know it &apos;s only through experiment that we &apos;ll discover exactly how to run a low carbon city , how to care for a much older population , how to deal with drug addiction and so on .
As a matter of fact , we added to the contract .
( Applause ) We &apos;ve hired and trained hundreds of facilitators to help guide people through the experience .
He said , &quot; &quot; What do you think it &apos;s like trying to run a country with 400 kinds of cheese ? &quot; &quot; But at the same time , we realize that our products are not safe and healthy .

What you just heard is &quot; &quot; Skylife &quot; &quot; by David Balakrishnan .
She said things she &apos;d always needed to say .
We also recognize that a lot of the products that we make — those videos and so forth — you know , they don &apos;t reach everybody , and so we &apos;ve been fostering projects that reach people outside of academia , and outside of the choir that most ecologists preach to .
This is why basically you have all this creative mistrust between the representatives and those whom they represent .
Over the course of last year , open-source hardware hackers have come up with multiple models for usable , Linux-based mobile phones , and the Earth Phone could spin off from this kind of project .
The greek word poem , it just means &quot; &quot; a made thing , &quot; &quot; and poetry is a set of techniques , ways of making patterns that put emotions into words .
So that &apos;s an asset because if you &apos;ve got to deal with the crash protection issues of the automobile , forget it — you &apos;re never going to fly it .
Now , the irony is , of course , that every large company started off as a small , entrepreneurial company .

There were no Motel 6 &apos;s or Howard Johnsons for me .
And then the kids graduate , and you have no responsibility any more — that &apos;s very good , too .
( Applause )
And that will stop reusing a syringe 20 or 30 times .
I asked them to name me just 20 .
So you ask yourself , if education has become so much more expensive , has it become so much better ?
Think Enron , Madoff , the mortgage crisis .
It &apos;s an acknowledgment of need or fallibility .
If you look over the past couple decades at the returns to capital — in other words , corporate profits — we see them going up , and we see that they &apos;re now at an all-time high .
And I pressed her , and I asked her , &quot; Why did you come back and get your care here ? &quot;

It &apos;s a giant airbag .
But that all happened later .
It appears that the more secretions she &apos;s got , the more likely the baby is to suckle quickly .
These are the sounds you would expect , but they are also the sounds of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds screeching in the night , the high-pitched honest cries of children and the thunderous , unbearable silence .
They have invented narco-submarines and boats that are not detected by radar .
There &apos;s consequences for carbonate organisms .
But when it comes to our cities and thinking about how death fits in our cities , there &apos;s much less regulation and design and thought than we might imagine .

Last year , I told you the story , in seven minutes , of Project Orion , which was this very implausible technology that technically could have worked , but it had this one-year political window where it could have happened .
And yeah , sub-atomic physics is deconstructive . You literally try to tear atoms apart to understand what &apos;s inside of them . But sculpture , from what I understand from great sculptors , is deconstructive , because you see a piece and you remove what doesn &apos;t need to be there .
These cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field , like a screen .

So we ask the question again , &quot; &quot; How many straight lines can I draw through the point , but never meet the original line ? &quot; &quot; Does someone want to guess ?
Good question . There are two main reasons .

( Laughter ) And here is our factory in Cape Town where we make horses .
There were a lot of them .
We have identified over 400 species of bees in Pennsylvania .
On the other hand , you &apos;re doing something new , no one &apos;s ever done before , you get it completely wrong . How should you be treated ?

In Africa last year , Africans ate 600 million wild animals , and consumed two billion kilograms of bush meat .
Unfortunately , empirical data , good , hard stats , don &apos;t exist , and therefore to prove my point , I first of all had to find some proxy way of uncovering how much food was being wasted .
And they kind of took me into the farm and showed me what it was like to live and work .
That &apos;s great , except the places that have malaria really bad , they don &apos;t have health care systems .

Mom says , &quot; &quot; If they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them , you must always say , &apos; Nothing . &apos; And if they insist , say , &apos; Whatever you mind to give me . &apos; &quot; &quot; This was the nature of being at that table .
Thank you very much .
Perhaps the tremendous progress we &apos;ve made over the last century by a series of forces are , in fact , accelerating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of abundance .
So no ego problems .
So I &apos;m very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross-section of my work that I &apos;ve done on the polar regions .
CA : To a lay person it seems like he has certain things to offer the U.S. , the government , you , others , in terms of putting things right and helping figure out a smarter policy , a smarter way forward for the future .
We can understand how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation that was set down 13.72 billion years ago — and yet , we can do calculations today to predict how it will look and it matches .
I guess we could make a glow chicken .
The driving cities in the Sun Belt , the Dallases and the Phoenixes and , sorry , Atlanta , these cities are not appearing on the list .

These people don &apos;t mind that I once worked as a singing waitress to help pay for college .
We only get one , and wow , did we ever get a good one .
What release finally , the embrace : though we were wary — it seemed so audacious — how much unspoken joy there was in that affirmation of equality and communion , no matter how much misunderstanding and pain had passed between you by then .
Would you like a better system ?
And to remind you that here is an example in which architecture actually did something .
One value of older people is that they are increasingly useful as grandparents for offering high-quality childcare to their grandchildren , if they choose to do it , as more young women enter the workforce and as fewer young parents of either gender stay home as full-time caretakers of their children .
My background should have led me to a different direction .
MR : Thank you very much indeed , Cynthia Kenyon .

Much of the debate in the U.S. has been about metadata .
That conflict , that tension , will be with us forever , that sometimes it wants to do what it wants to do , and sometimes it &apos;s going to do things for us .

Read that great piece in the New Yorker about how our echo boomers , 19 to 25 , over in Iraq taught each other how to do Sys Admin work , over the Internet in chat rooms .
How risky is this ?
What we need are for people to care , to actually go use it , just like they &apos;ve cared enough to use Kiva to make those connections .

And I remember this plan , born out of frustration from a kid who kept calling me &quot; &quot; Yogi , &quot; &quot; then pointed at my tummy and said , &quot; &quot; Too many picnic baskets . &quot; &quot; Turns out it &apos;s not that hard to trick someone , and one day before class , I said , &quot; Yeah , you can copy my homework , &quot; and I gave him all the wrong answers that I &apos;d written down the night before .
There are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them , and one of them is here in the audience , Marian Peeters , who &apos;s in the picture .

He &apos;s going to listen and be really interested .
Now , how do I know that I &apos;m right about this somewhat confusing poem ?
People seem to think politics is sexy .
There I would hear people say my father was a &quot; &quot; moudjahid &quot; &quot; and that means &quot; &quot; fighter . &quot; &quot; Later on , in France , I loved eavesdropping on grownups &apos; conversations , and I would hear all sorts of stories about my father &apos;s previous life , especially that he had &quot; &quot; done &quot; &quot; World War II , that he had &quot; &quot; done &quot; &quot; the Algerian war .
So as I shake this ketchup bottle , I get some true sensory feedback as the function of time in the bottom row .

Peter Diamandis : Probably the most difficult thing that I had to do was raise the capital for this . It was literally impossible .
It &apos;s a business plan for a corporation .
Okay , now why then is this curious reluctance and curious hostility to consciousness ?
For example , the psychologist Daniel Oppenheimer , a few years ago , teamed up with high school teachers .
&quot; Please get FISA right . &quot;
And he was working on gyroscopes ; he has a number of patents for that kind of thing .
So , these are early examples in the lab of emerging technologies to digitize fabrication . Computers that don &apos;t control tools but computers that are tools , where the output of a program rearranges atoms as well as bits .
And here &apos;s what that means for us .
So very carefully we had to mechanically scrape off all the wax .
TK : That hand &apos;s not so good for clapping .
Other ones are kind of going like this . All right .
Because what happens in a singly-linked list — this is trying to remove an existing entry from a list — and there &apos;s a difference between if it &apos;s the first entry or whether it &apos;s an entry in the middle .
They were reeling from the earthquake , they were reeling from cholera that was brought in by UN peacekeepers and still hasn &apos;t been eradicated .
So here &apos;s an image of red blood cells , and now we can actually map where the hemozoin and where the malaria parasites are inside those red blood cells .
It &apos;s important for us to grow organically .
But he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me to work directly for him in the White House .

They were sitting at a table . They were brought together for us .
So , close to 200,000 people a day migrate from the rural to the urban areas .
It &apos;s very ironic .
And I &apos;ve been thinking a lot about what I have learned over these last particularly 11 years with V-Day and &quot; &quot; The Vagina Monologues , &quot; &quot; traveling the world , essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet to stop violence against women .
In fact , when we run the numbers , it looks like it &apos;ll take us at least 15 years before we can fully finance all our conservation efforts .
And I &apos;m only showing you a little bit of this .
Thank you Frans de Waal , wherever you are , I love you and I &apos;d give anything to meet you .
And this is what we spend a lot of our time doing , is just making sure that we can keep up with this kind of traffic load .
And essentially , the oceans are breathing through the Southern Ocean .
You &apos;re wrong , because it &apos;s the opposite .
The stories of the colonoscopies were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
The only way you can do that is to not swim on top of the water .
The way I look back in the past is by using the fossilized remains of deepwater corals .
And I was getting it all on film and I was recording it , and I was thinking , &quot; &quot; This is it . This is the possibility of it maybe working .
Dreams are a form of consciousness on this definition .
So , there &apos;s this guy , right ? Victorian era .
And I would like to make a case to you that over the years since we first developed atomic weaponry , until this very moment , we &apos;ve actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world that &apos;s characterized by two phases , which I &apos;m going to go through with you right now .
The first one is harm / care .
Jay Chiat is a glutton for punishment , and he hired me to do a house for him in the Hamptons .
But the bird , instead of flying away , goes flop , flop , flop and lands on my head .
That &apos;s how the system &apos;s supposed to work .
CK : Yes , that &apos;s right .
There is different type of barbaria .
And then sort of through a process of wandering around , I got to the thought that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars , in a way that is convenient and affordable , you could get to a solution .
Number one : China feels as if it &apos;s been humiliated at the hands of the West through a hundred years of history , beginning with the Opium Wars .

I started a foundation to bet on these good people doing good things .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve misjudged this women , &quot; &quot; thought Mr. Dickens .
But what I want to point out is you can buy this from iTunes .
You &apos;re going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , I gave myself the job title of TED Custodian for a reason , and I will promise you right here and now that the core values that make TED special are not going to be interfered with .
He was trying to tell people how they should live through the medium of sermons , the classic medium of delivery of religions .
And there &apos;s Evan .
And so I &apos;ll just go get them .
And sometimes it &apos;s about a legacy of the neighborhood , like in Morrisania , about the jazz history .
So when I went through the data , I had very surprising results , because I found that four out of the five marinating ingredients actually inhibited the carcinogen formation .
How many inventors and untold entrepreneurs live out this phenomenon ?
And fundamentally , it &apos;s a story about how starting as very small children and continuing out all the way to the greatest accomplishments of our culture , we get the world right .
I don &apos;t see anybody actually being able to do that very effectively .
What I &apos;m showing you again here is this map of the Human Microbiome Project Data , so each point represents a sample from one body site from one of 250 healthy adults .
I recognize the pain they caused to others , for which there can be no forgiveness , but the pain they caused to me , there is , &quot; &quot; she said .
And if not , can you make yourself smart again ?
Those girls have never touched Google .
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have , which is the choice overload problem .
And Afghanistan , Afghanistan , we think has probably stopped polio repeatedly .
EH : Not bad .
We don &apos;t know how far it will go , but it &apos;s going on .
He had a bold idea that — what he called the cognitive trade-off hypothesis .
So here &apos;s the situation .
I like the idea of collaboration with people like that because it pushes you .
We are policing the world , and how are we doing that ?
Bob Dylan is 23 years old , and his career is just reaching its pinnacle .
War and malnutrition kills people together with hope .
And the reason it does is not because of the clever encryption .
Now , I know what you &apos;re thinking .
( Laughter ) Yeah .
OK , that &apos;s fair enough .
The next bit , we &apos;d chartered a pretty elderly Russian plane to fly us up to a town called Khatanga , which was the sort of last bit of civilization .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ve had these people approach you before .
I have faith , for instance , that peace in the Middle East is possible despite the ever-accumulating mass of evidence to the contrary .
So how we use yeast in the future is going to be really interesting .
So these are a couple of instrumentalists .
Everest is an extreme environment .
That &apos;s what the experience of the last 20 years has been .
On the other end of the spectrum , some were so sick they had to live in complete darkness , unable to tolerate the sound of a human voice or the touch of a loved one .
Maybe some of you have received an email that says something like , &quot; &quot; Hi , I &apos;m a Nigerian banker , and I &apos;d like to give you 53 billion dollars because I like your face . &quot; &quot; Or funnycats.exe , which rumor has it was quite successful in China &apos;s recent campaign against America .
If someone was to throw an egg at the Sistine Chapel , we &apos;d all go crazy .
( Music ) And so they &apos;re beautiful , but this libertarian has some important lessons he wants us to learn from this .
And so we prospered in a way that no other animal has .
And it didn &apos;t stop there .
So after I returned home , I received word that one member of the family had been shot 30 times in the face .
And then we took these flies and allowed them to make choices .
But in this country , where the government apparently does not feel compelled to provide health care for citizens , ( Laughter ) we &apos;ve taken a very different approach .
All four of my oars broke before I reached halfway across .
Hello ?
But this one is — the Bible says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month , and more than that , you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat .
So , why is that ?
It may just take the right crazy idea .
So in this image , what you can see is that everything smaller than five nanometers is going from the blood , through the kidney , into the urine , and everything else that &apos;s bigger is retained .
( Audience : Random . ) Michael Sandel : At random . You would do it by lottery .
But when you get specific , when you actually ask about the actual taxing and spending issues under consideration , people are remarkably centrist , they &apos;re remarkably open to compromise .
So every second , half of the Library of Congress is swooshing around in this machine . It &apos;s a big machine .
And you all know that if you are going to determine whether you &apos;re related to your brother or your sister , you can &apos;t do it by looking at differences .
Now , technology has changed a lot since the Victrola days .
So with all these theatric elements , this pushes me in another role , and that would be , possibly , the dramaturge .
We &apos;ve discovered things like , for example , RNA interference only a few years ago , and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work .
So let &apos;s make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana .
Just think of Sebastian and how he bought the cat to influence his .
The person I believed for half of my life to have superpowers suddenly needed help to get dressed or to cut food .
The good news is I &apos;m very aware of my responsibilities to get you out of here because I &apos;m the only thing standing between you and the bar .
Not enough to stabilize the climate .
Who &apos;s not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings — if you &apos;re different from all the other beings ?
And then you &apos;d see an image of Britney Spears to remind you of this funny anecdote you want to tell .
Take the planet Venus .
( Music ) But basically , it &apos;s just a B , with four sads .
( Laughter ) So , I took a look at my life , a hard look at my life , and I saw some things very disturbing . ( Laughter )
And I don &apos;t mean the whole economy , because to grow an economy of India to the size of U.K. — that &apos;s a piece of cake , with one billion people .
On the other side , there is this girl .
And some people think that &apos;s a good thing .
Right ? And then I realized , that was on my website , and then it said , like , you know , the quote was attributed to me and I thought , oh , I said something , you know , in an interview .
It &apos;s got a remarkably clear yes / no answer , and just requires phenomenal grunt .
I hope that you will take a look at it .
( Laughter ) But , you know , I could pop a book on in the middle of the night , and — ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now , the Kurzweil reader is simply a program on my laptop .
They would not leave me alone until I let them have a piece , but it was not a good one . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , it occurred to me that I should invite Dr. Robicsek to lecture at Wofford College on — what else ?
Education is often of poor quality .
And if they &apos;re on a smartphone on Google , they &apos;ve got access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton did 15 years ago .
&quot; &quot; Strange , &quot; &quot; he agreed .
I &apos;m excited when I glimpse that kind of thinking writ large .
I &apos;m a historian by training , and what I study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy — meaning human bodies , animal bodies — how they dealt with bodily fluids , concepts of bodies ; how have they thought about bodies .
However , I longed to share my life with someone .
But yes there are some solutions .
And when this story posted , I ran to my computer to send it to the IMF official .
Yeah , you all have a body , right ?
It stayed here and tried not to move any part of its body .
Next is Maynard Sipes .
Guys , we have an issue .
If you look at birds , which live a long time , cells from the birds tend to be more resistant to a lot of different environmental stresses like high temperature or hydrogen peroxide , things like that .
And that begins to lift a heavy burden off the world &apos;s poor .
Here &apos;s another case that I think is interesting .
What has changed our society has been wireless devices .
How important is this ?
It means that you have to save more today .
I don &apos;t quite mean that the golden rule itself is written in our genes , but you can go to a hunter gatherer society that has had no exposure to any of the great religious traditions , no exposure to ethical philosophy , and you &apos;ll find , if you spend time with these people , that , basically , they believe that one good turn deserves another , and that bad deeds should be punished .
He came up with our name and logo . We &apos;re Mission Motors .
Now , years ago , when I was working at YouTube , we were looking for ways to encourage more people to rate videos , and it was interesting because when we looked into the data , we found that almost everyone was exclusively using the highest five-star rating , a handful of people were using the lowest one-star , and virtually no one was using two , three or four stars .
I made a promise that the next time I would fly around the world , it would be with no fuel , independent from fossil energies , in order to be safe , not to be threatened by the fuel gauge .
If you remember what I told you about FLS at the beginning , it &apos;s knowledge and skills .
( Laughter ) Okay . Okay . Oh , well .
Now , in the 20th century we had a revolution that was initiated at the beginning of the 20th century , and which is still going on .
And I don &apos;t think that we should give up on beauty .
Why don &apos;t we take it a little longer — maybe two hours instead of an hour — and have less of this intensity ? &quot; &quot; And the nurses told me two things .
How well are we doing determining what piece to move where ?
They just thought , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;ll give a course of 10 .
And no tricky shit behind the thing . I mean , it &apos;s all — you &apos;ve got to be very honest with what you &apos;re doing if it really is going to work .
The idea is that the building blocks of the digital economy are connectivity and entrepreneurship .
And I think we probably do need to pay some more attention to that , because it &apos;s actually kind of fragile .
And at seven o &apos;clock every night , I took me some more girls , already corrupted .
They have learned their lesson . They will control .
( Applause )
NL : I am the peer of whoever I &apos;m talking to .
Thank you .
Unfortunately , I don &apos;t fly trans-Atlantic business class often enough to know , or any other kind of business class really , but I assume that in business class , you don &apos;t hear many expressions of , you know , bigotry about racial groups or ethnic groups , because the people who are flying trans-Atlantic business class are doing business with all these people ; they &apos;re making money off all these people . And I really do think that , in that sense at least , capitalism has been a constructive force , and more fundamentally , it &apos;s a non-zero-sumness that has been a constructive force in expanding people &apos;s realm of moral awareness . I think the non-zero-sum dynamic ,
Sometimes I can stand before the world — and when I say this , transformation is a difficult and slow process — sometimes I can stand before the world and say , &quot; &quot; My name is Chris Abani .
OK , so , confession : I &apos;ve always been weirdly obsessed with advertising .
And different people will have different places they want it set .
So this is a picture of me holding one of the first watercolor paintings I ever made .
Men have sex before marriage , and people more or less turn a blind eye .
In fact , nothing expresses that assumption more clearly than three simple numbers : 9-1-1 , which , of course , is the number for the emergency police operator here in Canada and in the United States , where the average response time to a police 911 emergency call is about 10 minutes .
But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first .
TBL : Can you say &quot; &quot; now &quot; &quot; ?
As an absolute connection , it only works one way .
And on the other end of the spectrum , this is a microstructure .
( Laughter ) And when she saw him , he was down on one knee , he had the ring out .
Now we can take the words and start to build sentences out of them .
But then he decides , &quot; Let me tweak my tactics a little bit . &quot;
So this is a plate of nachos .
There &apos;s something that it feels like to drink beer which is not what it feels like to do your income tax or listen to music , and this qualitative feel automatically generates a third feature , namely , conscious states are by definition subjective in the sense that they only exist as experienced by some human or animal subject , some self that experiences them .
They &apos;re all searching for their staircase .
Office worker : Got a ham and swiss on rye ? BM : No .
So I don &apos;t know , it started to become an interesting mix .
You degrade forests , you go beyond the boundary on land , you undermine the ability of the climate system to stay stable .
I pushed back .
If you really want great hamburger , it turns out it makes a difference if you align the grain .
It would have the interdisciplinarity of the TED Conference .
That &apos;s one of the themes that Sylvia reminds us about : understand this ocean of ours , this basic life support system , the dominant life support system on the planet .
And we &apos;d sing this old song . She didn &apos;t have a whole lot of energy , so I &apos;d sing , &quot; &quot; Hey , hey ! &quot; &quot; and she &apos;d just answer back with , &quot; &quot; Black-eyed Susie . &quot; &quot; Oh , hey , hey , black-eyed Susie ! Hey , hey , black-eyed Susie !
And fortunately , in the course of this project , the transplant surgeons and the other people decided , forget common practice . We have to switch .
( Laughter ) So in the studio , rather than drawing , we began to learn how to knit .
There is some modeling of ecosystems going on now .
And from , you know , Fattushis , to Taxistan to , you know , for the Fashtoonks , Botoxia , Pashmina , Khlintunisia , you know , we were able to take the city and make fun of this completely foreign , who are — what &apos;s going on over here ?
This is why I can wear my gho with pride .
But then I thought , oh , I &apos;m sending myself mixed messages .
Maybe we don &apos;t recognize it every time , but we understand that it happens .
I do dream in X-ray . I see my projects in my sleep .
And this is just a very simple way of understanding what kind of innovation , what kind of different design we need .
Literally hundreds of elevator rides were spent with me alone stuffing the pump into my Spanx , hoping the doors wouldn &apos;t open unexpectedly .
And what hotel means , in Kenya and India , is an eating-place .
( Applause )
Talk to any astrophysicist .
As you get towards the 1970s , things are going to start to change .
Some of them were toys . Some of them were candy .
And if you don &apos;t know them , that &apos;s okay . Most casual players probably do .
From my American perspective , when a paying customer makes a reasonable request based on her preferences , she has every right to have that request met .
It &apos;s just a question to use some techniques like the time lapse .
I know most people don &apos;t see it that way .
Food can be there and people can &apos;t buy it .
Jihad may at times take the form of fighting , but only sometimes , under strict conditions , within rules and limits .
Take , for example , the incidents of suicide baiting .
Here &apos;s another one . Bang .
He went into a coma .
So there &apos;s some that are all about the toast , and all about the transformation of toast .
It took me weeks of internal thinking to try to reconcile the good reasons we had to assist that family and the soldier of fortune he became .
And it seemed like time that we become that way ourselves .
Well , I thought there would be a podium , so I &apos;m a bit scared .
And in that sense , ballooning is a beautiful metaphor .
Should I take vitamin C ? Should I be taking wheatgrass ?
We hired a team of physicists , software engineers and biologists to work on this , and the first thing we had to work on was to create the human body , basically .
My story begins right here actually in Rajasthan about two years ago .
Just a few examples : an artist who paints with fluorescent Physarum ; a collaborative team who are combining biological and electronic design with 3D printing technologies in a workshop ; another artist who is using the slime mold as a way of engaging a community to map their area .
But in fact , in a few years , organizations will know so much about us , they will be able to infer our desires before we even form them , and perhaps buy products on our behalf before we even know we need them .
I have to say , these are very hybrid places .
We were spending so much time with this leopard and getting to understand her individualism , her personal character , that maybe we were taking it a little bit far .
And just to give you a flavor of how well this works , this is the result we get when we analyze this for some familiar words .
What &apos;s missing ? What would I like to know ?
This is bringing together international — there are 50 nations involved in this mission — interagency — these development agencies — and private-public , to take on this kind of security .
The scientific embargo — if it &apos;s ever submitted to &quot; &quot; Nature , &quot; &quot; hopefully , it will be accepted .
I &apos;m a member of the Blackfeet Nation .
It &apos;s a satellite that goes into space , which is probably the least open-source thing you can imagine , and it contains an Arduino connected to a bunch of sensors . So if you know how to use Arduino , you can actually upload your experiments into this satellite and run them .
They &apos;ve been bombed by the military , they &apos;ve been besieged , they &apos;ve been stormed by ISIS and they &apos;ve been cut off from supplies for years .
It &apos;s about the same as yours and mine .
I think , if you live with your head in the clouds every now and then , it helps you keep your feet on the ground .
Let &apos;s look at the Pantheon and the Piazza della Rotonda in front of it .
I &apos;ve been building topsoil .
You &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; Aha , but New Zealand has a higher GDP than Chad ! &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a good point , well made .
I was a new mother and a young rabbi in the spring of 2004 and the world was in shambles .
So the country in the world with the highest social progress , the number one country on social progress is New Zealand .
When did we originate as a species ?
So the 20th century , then , saw how much more complex reality was , but it also saw a positive side .
They couldn &apos;t hear what I was saying in the context of a 10 back-to-back PowerPoint presentation conference .
Soon , you &apos;ll be able to look inside your brain and program , control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there .
And I &apos;m not talking about all comedy here , because , clearly , there &apos;s plenty of humor that colors safely within the lines of what we already think and feel .
Now we &apos;ve got the data , plus we have metadata .
You &apos;ve gone through hundreds of TV channels , just switching channel after channel , and then suddenly you actually stop on one .
I have won a lot of awards through this work .
Leandro started a campaign using one of our tools , the Pressure Cooker , the same one that Bia and Jovita used , and the state government changed their minds before Christmas Eve .
So what you do one day is you take a pile of arrowheads , and you walk up to the one that can &apos;t speak very well , and you put the arrowheads down in front of him , hoping that he &apos;ll get the idea that you want to trade your arrowheads for finished arrows .
There &apos;s also a huge emotional impact .
RB : Yeah , as it turned out , it proved to be the right move .
Well , you know , sometimes the most important things come in the smallest packages .
The important question is , &quot; &quot; Is it interesting ? &quot; &quot; And I follow this question , not worrying about &quot; &quot; Is it music ? &quot; &quot; — not worrying about the definition of the thing that I &apos;m making .
Then you can look at the ratios of those numbers , and figure out for a data center where you don &apos;t have that information , you can figure out , but maybe you only have one of those , you know the square footage , then you could figure out well , maybe the power is proportional .
In contrast , they will walk an extra mile to avoid people who are not having fun .
I received a poignant tweet .
Well , we &apos;ve seen that that can &apos;t be true .
On the other , the non-U.S.-related threats out of those 54 , the other 42 of them , the PRISM program was hugely relevant to that , and in fact was material in contributing to stopping those attacks .
And she looked at me , and she said , &quot; &quot; But , Aimee , that &apos;s not fair . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And the incredible thing was she really meant it .
JB : It &apos;s so powerful . Richard Ford , who &apos;s won the Pulitzer Prize , says that dyslexia helped him write sentences .
It made it possible for us to take close-up pictures of people 100 kilomteres away , like this one . ( Laughter ) People called us and asked , how is this man doing ?
And they &apos;re coming into the city by rail .
Now I &apos;m going to play the burst for you .
From &apos; 83 to &apos; 95 : two percent per annum .
So if we had some way to stop this scaling — and so I picked up some shells on the beach . And I asked them , what is scaling ? What &apos;s inside your pipes ?
This is all done in between the ribs .
It &apos;s just love . That &apos;s all it is .
So we &apos;ve developed certain tactics and strategies to cover up .
The paper you &apos;re holding in your hand contains the details of Iraqi civilians that died as result of the invasion .
Thus 900,000 people either have died or have significant damage to their heart muscle .
And she makes them so they could either be broken up into payments , or they could be like these , which are leaves that can be payments .
Pretty quickly I saw that if you had more than a few values you &apos;d never remember on the screen where things were .
For me , the design exercise always begins here with the periodic table , enunciated by another professor , Dimitri Mendeleyev .
Because even through the squeaks of his hearing aids , his understanding of music was profound .
In June 2010 , Internet changed my life forever .
And I says , &quot; &quot; Well , try me . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; But I don &apos;t believe that you can do this . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; So , to cut a long story short , I went home , went underneath the microscope , and I crushed up a piece of glass , crushed it up .
The next moment , as soon as they finished and disappeared into the shadows , a young man with a propane lantern came on , hung it up on a tree , set up a curtain .
Now , these ideas and these events allow us even to deconstruct iconic places that many of you have been to , like Machu Picchu .
I could feel the wind against my face and the beat of my racing heart as if it were happening in that very moment .
And maybe something else .
Now , the balance that I try to fight for , I , as any good liberal , try to fight for first by looking to the government . Total mistake , right ?
Instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem , design the solution around what the human will do as well .
These legs that I was on , which I &apos;ll take out right now — I was the first person in the world on these legs .
I &apos;ll just take you to Bangladesh for a minute .
The computer was cracked open .

Then you can of course always go and see this guy .
It &apos;s the coolest stuff .
Now , why would neuroscientists say that we don &apos;t just construct , we reconstruct ?
But some day , some day , maybe it &apos;s going to work .
So Netra was stuck with 30 paintings of mine .

We don &apos;t know what the atmospheres of these planets are like because the planets are so small and dim compared to their stars and so far away from us .
And if everything goes smoothly , one to two weeks from now you &apos;ll know where the epidemic was today .

How about 40 ? Okay , it &apos;s a whole varied response .
It all started when we at CERN saw something intriguing in our data : a hint of a new particle , an inkling of a possibly extraordinary answer to this question .
In Northern California , we &apos;re beginning to take observations with the first 42 telescopes of the Allen Telescope Array — and I &apos;ve got to take a moment right now to publicly thank Paul Allen and Nathan Myhrvold and all the TeamSETI members in the TED community who have so generously supported this research .

But this is not a very efficient way to organize a regulation of wealth dynamics .
So let me show you the scene , and then I basically used the trick that was identified by Sergei Eisenstein , which is , if you have a camera that &apos;s moving with a moving object , what is not moving appears to be moving , and what is moving appears to be stopped , so what you &apos;re actually seeing now is the train is not moving at all , and what is actually moving is the floor .
In this country , if we win the election , we are going to make all government spending over 25,000 pounds transparent and available online , searchable for anyone to see .
Sooner or later , sooner or later , the rule of history is that where power goes governance must follow .
So really the resolution is quite incredible .
It shows a cockroach moving over incredibly rough terrain without tipping over , and it &apos;s able to do this because its legs are a combination of rigid materials , which is what we traditionally use to make robots , and soft materials .
And there are hints of this .
Now this is a real project that we worked on , literally , you would not believe how hard .
If you are a bit short in mathematical skills , don &apos;t worry .
So here &apos;s the thing .

As a quarter of the world population is influenced by it , you &apos;d be wise to do something about that .
So we documented this invention step by step on a website for inventors called Instructables , in the hope that somebody would make it even better .
And this is so powerful that when they tweak their stats , when they say your crops wilt after eight hours , or after six hours , or after 24 hours , it changes the life cycle of some 70 million people during the day .

And you might say , &quot; &quot; Can you really be that specific ?
And on the surface , Cassini has found liquid .
What &apos;s it gonna look like ? We have huge grand challenges these days of habitat loss . We have more and more people , billions of people , in 100 years , God knows how many people , and how little space there will be to fit all of them , so we need to change the way that we see cities , and looking at this picture on the left of New York City today , you can see how gray and brown it is .

And in the spring , when the sun returns to the ice , it forms the phytoplankton , grows under that ice , and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed , and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life .
And we quickly realized that our coming together was more than just a union of two people , but was a model of possibility for the millions of LGBTQ folks who have been sold this lie that family and matrimony is antithetical to who they are — for those of us who rarely get to see ourselves reflected in love and happiness .

What could it be ? &quot; &quot; So today , 100 years later , I invite you all on an incredible journey with me , a 37-year-old Yale graduate and professor .
And what if we could value it a different way , so it would actually work ?

After all , the absence of a duty of care within many professions can all too easily amount to accusations of negligence , and that being the case , can we be really comfortable with the thought that we &apos;re in effect being negligent in respect of the health of our own societies and the values that necessarily underpin them ?

Scars that run from the middle of my chest all the way out to my outer torso .
So not the habitual architecture that instills in us the false sort of stability , but an architecture that is full of tension , an architecture that goes beyond itself to reach a human soul and a human heart , and that breaks out of the shackles of habits .
But what happened was that he had to be on medication that , at that time — Diflucan , which in the States is used for yeast infections — cost 30 dollars a pill .
So that kind of motivational tool that is used actually , in and of itself , has a long-term side effect , in that every time we use a technology that uses something like public recognition or status , we &apos;re actually positively endorsing this as a good and normal thing to care about — that way , possibly having a detrimental effect on the long-term psychological well-being of ourselves as a culture .
In fact , what they did to get food was they got in their cars , drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts , came back with a week &apos;s worth of shopping , and wondered what on earth to do with it .
In the commercials , and on the boxes for the Easy-Bake Ovens , Hasbro marketed them specifically to girls .

Saint Obi : I was so fascinated , you know , with those cowboy movies .
And maybe , if we want to be on surer footing , what we really want is a moral framework that will help guide us there , that will tell us what kinds of things are right and wrong in the first place , and how would we know in a given situation what to do .
It wouldn &apos;t create the volume that would fill a large space such as the Cologne Opera House .
Well , I was born with a rare visual condition called achromatopsia , which is total color blindness , so I &apos;ve never seen color , and I don &apos;t know what color looks like , because I come from a grayscale world .

And , using those rules , he was able to say that there are in fact only two objects with six symmetries .
I &apos;m talking about today .
There are so many things to do in this life , and if we could have a simulacrum , a digital doppelgänger of ourselves that helps us process books , do shopping , be our best friends , I believe our mind clones , these digital versions of ourselves , will ultimately be our best friends , and for me personally and Bina personally , we love each other like crazy .
But the market also had bypassed low income farmers , because these systems were both too expensive , and they were constructed for fields that were too large .
We conducted about a dozen focus groups with a broad cross-section of black men , and we learned that for them , being healthy was as much about being perceived as healthy as it was about feeling healthy , and that feeling good went hand in hand with looking good .

However , I will show to you now that we do not need to go to Mars to explore alien worlds .
And so I got myself a job and I was working for a consultancy , and we would get in to these meetings , and these managers would come in , and they would say , &quot; Well , what we &apos;re going to do here is really important , you know . &quot;

We also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of 13 related organisms , and we tried to compare all of those , to see what they had in common .
They are shaping the way we consume .
( Music : &quot; &quot; Rapper &apos;s Delight &quot; &quot; by The Sugarhill Gang ) The MC would improvise lyrics in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies .

Politics has come to resemble a cynical team game played by politicians , while the public has been pushed aside as if sitting on the seats of a stadium in which passion for politics is gradually making room for blindness and desperation .
And as these technologies go forward , you keep seeing this , you keep seeing this , you keep seeing things — 2000 , human genome sequence — and it seems like nothing &apos;s happening , until it does .
We want to avoid death , and the dream of doing that in this body in this world forever is the first and simplest kind of immortality story , and it might at first sound implausible , but actually , almost every culture in human history has had some myth or legend of an elixir of life or a fountain of youth or something that promises to keep us going forever .
And so I think we &apos;re ready to tackle one of the most important questions in neuroscience : how are the brains of men and women different ?
No relationship — gay , straight or anything — that we would regard as remotely healthy or functional looks like that , and yet somehow , you put it on prime time , you slap some makeup on it , throw the glitter on , put it out there as movement , not as text , and we , as a culture , tune in and clap .
And you can see in these central images here , scanning electron micrographs of some of these guys — these are gardens of these bacteria .

The moment you admit to loving someone , you admit to having a lot to lose , and it &apos;s true that these questions do provide a mechanism for getting to know someone quickly , which is also a mechanism for being known , and I think this is the thing that most of us really want from love : to be known , to be seen , to be understood .

They would make a little bit more money ; their standard of living would shift and would get better .
That &apos;s a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do math , I &apos;m sure .
Now the problem with the robots doing this is that they can &apos;t get unstuck , with the material .
These are zebra fish . They &apos;re normally black and silver .

Jabbar : Then what about the rest of us ?
What experiments would you run ?
What I &apos;m going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas .
Now , these people will make guesses , they &apos;ll say things like , &quot; &quot; Why am I getting electricity ?
And their response , of course , was no more than we wanted to stop the genocide and put our troops in harm &apos;s way to do that , nor do we now want to get in the way and pluck genocidaires from camps .

The first of these is natural selection — that &apos;s random mutation and selective retention — along with our basic anatomy and physiology — the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails .
And why can they serve that much ?
I do so many things on this little device .
&quot; &quot; The hour from night to day .
Why do we respond so much to our knowledge of where something comes from ?
Now this noise is so great that society places a huge premium on those of us who can reduce the consequences of noise .
They &apos;re changing the scale of what we can do , and what we &apos;ve developed is something we call FFTT , which is a Creative Commons solution to building a very flexible system of building with these large panels where we tilt up six stories at a time if we want to .
First one is the political system .
As I said to you , this is the first time I &apos;ve shown this in public .
We depend on the fact that audiences , such as yourselves , will make assumptions .

And I think that &apos;s how we got to become human .
So , this talk is going to be about how do we make things and what are the new ways that we &apos;re going to make things in the future .
And what you &apos;re looking at is a paper form in the hand of a Ministry of Health nurse in Indonesia , who is tramping out across the countryside in Indonesia on , I &apos;m sure , a very hot and humid day , and she is going to be knocking on thousands of doors over a period of weeks or months , knocking on the doors and saying , &quot; &quot; Excuse me , we &apos;d like to ask you some questions .

A metaphor will serve here : Where elite mathematicians and statisticians and theorists often serve as architects in the expanding realm of science , the remaining large majority of basic applied scientists , including a large portion of those who could be said to be of the first rank , are the ones who map the terrain , they scout the frontiers , they cut the pathways , they raise the buildings along the way .
So we have this field of science that &apos;s all about slime , and color changes . Check this out .
It &apos;s making a little bit fun of getting older , and , you know , people might like it .

But just because a system is sick doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s dying .
Yet , no amount of diplomacy or institutional design can make up for local failures and the consequences that they have .
You can say a person is lying .

And you &apos;re seeing a lot of things passing through its minds , a lot of self-models that try to explain the relationship between actuation and sensing . It then tries to do a second action that creates the most disagreement among predictions of these alternative models , like a scientist in a lab . Then it does that and tries to explain that , and prune out its self-models .
We know that on Mars and the Moon there are tons of these structures .

Whether I was laid on my side or strapped into my wheelchair .
If someone steps on them by accident or picks them up , they can explode .
The transactions are secured through cryptography , and over time , that transaction history gets locked in blocks of data that are then cryptographically linked together and secured .
Its changes will affect all of humanity .

Hire the Scrapper .
And it &apos;s a kind of rope-like structure that twirls and swirls like this .
Right ? They did .

This is the first transplant of naked DNA , where you take an entire DNA operating system out of one cell , insert it into a different cell , and have that cell boot up as a separate species .

There &apos;s carbon that &apos;s being bought with sugar , with coffee , with beef .

But ultimately you &apos;re going to civilianize it , probably two thirds .
And so as we see in this image of light during the night , there are lots of areas of the Earth where human development is much greater and other areas where it &apos;s much less , but between them we see large dark areas of relatively unexplored ocean .

So they &apos;re really small , generally , they &apos;re square and flat and hard , and frankly , most of them just aren &apos;t very attractive , and so my team and I have been thinking of ways to really change and mix up the process and the outcome of designing electronics .
So sight is one third of your brain by volume and can claim about two thirds of your brain &apos;s processing resources .

You see , it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song , you needed a studio and a producer .
So it &apos;s not just the end user that you &apos;re thinking about , but everyone who interacts with the product , so , for example , the prosthetist who fits the knee , but also the context in which the knee is being fit .
Discrete moments from our lives are its chapters .
I &apos;ll be focusing on the air here . This is a solar-powered airplane — 165 miles carrying a person from France to England as a symbol that solar power is going to be an important part of our future . Then we did the solar car for General Motors — the Sunracer — that won the race in Australia .
( Movie montage of &quot; &quot; It &apos;s 4 a.m. &quot; &quot; ) ( Laughter ) Rives : So somewhere along the line , I realized I have a hobby I didn &apos;t know I wanted , and it is crowdsourced .

These cars will work in certain places and not in others .
Things that would take us weeks , months to find in ones and zeroes , are immediately apparent in some sort of visual abstraction , and as we continue to go through this and throw more and more information at it , what we find is that we &apos;re capable of processing billions of ones and zeros in a matter of seconds just by using our brain &apos;s built-in ability to analyze patterns .
They were really looking for us , the designers , to create the skins , to put some pretty stuff outside of the box .
For the reason that you need to attract volunteers .
The televised death and march had a huge impact on public opinion .
I think one of the reasons I care so much about robots that use their body to communicate and use their body to move is — I &apos;m going to let you in on a little secret we roboticists are hiding — is that every one of you is going to be living with a robot at some point in your life .

What is even more tragic is that we know about a bunch of other species of animals out there , but their biology remains sorely under-studied .
Because if you could find those , those would be some of the signals that could drive learning .

It &apos;s good that compassion was extended beyond the family by this kind of evolutionary logic .

So , she had to go to meeting after meeting , same arguments made over and over again .
I essentially drag sledges for a living , so it doesn &apos;t take an awful lot to flummox me intellectually , but I &apos;m going to read this question from an interview earlier this year : &quot; &quot; Philosophically , does the constant supply of information steal our ability to imagine or replace our dreams of achieving ?
I think back to my father .
So the great thing about the Mola is that when we put the tag on them — if you look up here — that &apos;s streaming off , that &apos;s right where we put the tag .

And they were able to do it . That was their design , using that same computer modeling system and only five or six really different kinds of parts , a couple of struts , like this , some exterior cladding material and a very simple framing system that was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck .
And not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint , sustainable from an economic standpoint as well .

But it hasn &apos;t really been shown , it &apos;s because you have a neural simulator , simulating your own body and subtracting off that sense .
( Laughing ) So the TEDTalk laid out in very simple terms , a charter city is a place where you start with uninhabited land , a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to opt in , to go live under those rules or not .
To make further progress we really need to look at the orbits of stars that are much further away .
What you &apos;re going to use is Google Cellular .

Now , looking back on that night , I &apos;d love so desperately to believe that I treated that woman on that night with the same empathy and compassion I &apos;d shown the 27-year-old newlywed who came to the E.R. three nights earlier with lower back pain that turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer .
What shapes are the trees ?
That &apos;s something we ought to celebrate .

Why are we building these headquarters ?
Everybody begins to move around , and your task is to keep track of who had a coat at the beginning and who didn &apos;t . So I &apos;m just going to show you an example where there is only one sad kid . It &apos;s easy because you can actually track it with your eyes .

It &apos;s not that easy . It &apos;s an artichoke .
Now there is a case to be made that control freaks and perfectionists should not get tattoos , and I &apos;m going to return to that point in a few minutes .
It will stratify society as much as it liberates it .
Woman : You &apos;re asking me a hard question .
And she doesn &apos;t want me to come and visit .
So this was a great project .
And so that &apos;s a picture from Pearl Harbor just grafted onto Los Angeles .
We started our media lab , sounds like a real great story .
That is , combining two or more fields and creating something new at the intersection .
And importantly , we need to reallocate the few specialists who are available to perform roles such as capacity-building and supervision .
We look at it every single day . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; What ? You don &apos;t understand these screens and you keep staring at it for two months ? What for ? &quot; &quot; So a little girl who you see just now , she raised her hand , and she says to me in broken Tamil and English , she said , &quot; &quot; Well , apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule causes disease , we haven &apos;t understood anything else . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So I tested them .
If you want to know how , ask yourself this question : What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail ?

All buildings today have something in common .
It worked out .
The pavilion &apos;s design goal was to be kind of quiet and peaceful .
In this box is a standard , off-the-shelf LED lamp .
So all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure — I &apos;m going back now to , sort of , the explosive part of the Web in 1994 , when it was growing 2,300 percent a year .
In the long run , that &apos;s bad news , so researchers are working on finding alternatives to control these mites .
A gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity of us having to leave the continent so that we can fulfill our potential .
We have the ability to do that , and I think it &apos;s going to work .
And so perhaps once they cleaned up the pigeon droppings , get the disk kind of operational again , normal operations would resume .
But we really need to get to grips with the numbers to work out how to do it .
My job was to ask this question : &quot; What do the stories look like ? &quot;
So investing in environmental protection did not hurt our economy .
And it turns out the web is awash with this sort of evidence that supports this sort of thinking .

So he led us through the process of creating a family mission statement .
One day , he had an argument with his father , and he yelled , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re telling me what to do ?
So we decided — actually , the highlight &apos;s right there . Oh , thank you .
When I took over this , I tried to really figure out , like , what my vision would be .
I want to see the day when cancer is treated easily because it can be routinely diagnosed at the very early stages , and I &apos;m certain that in the very near future , because of this and other breakthroughs that we are seeing every day in the life sciences , the way we see cancer will radically change .
One out of 10 experiments has any success .
Something had gone wrong with the lion tamer .
OK . We &apos;ve heard a lot of people speak at this conference about the power of the human mind .
I think things like , &quot; &quot; Oh ! I know — I must clean the floor .
Well today I want to present to you an idea that may be surprising and may even seem implausible , but which is supported by the latest evidence from psychology and biology .
And it really impressed me — I met him two weeks after he got out of prison — that he went through that experience , and ended up with the demeanor that he had .
I ’ m not talking about James Cameron — although I could , but I won ’ t .
I would carry their golf bags up to the top , and they &apos;d pay me a dollar .

This is a piece of multi-year ice that &apos;s 12 years old .
I was so happy — ( Applause ) — that my sister was alive !
You cannot turn them off with a switch .
The exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this genetic code , made the viral particles .
You &apos;ve got people in white hats making food .
Hiding is a progressive habit , and once you start hiding , it becomes harder and harder to step forward and speak out .
Maybe you think , it &apos;s his phone .
The real issue is that child is living with 12 other people in a two-bedroom apartment .
And it &apos;s only by giving people access and letting them choose what to do that you get those sweeping changes that we have seen globally — except for sub-Saharan Africa and those places in South Asia and Afghanistan .
I know , you need to get rid of that seed first . Can you sing ?
It &apos;s a very complicated ecology .
I don &apos;t think this segment of the market can be addressed by companies parachuting from another place of the world , and just dumping product and selling into the markets .
It took weeks for us to really get to what happened to her when she was in that house , but finally she started opening up to me , and when she opened up , what I heard was she didn &apos;t know what her rights were , but she did know she had a certain level of protection by her government that failed her , and so we were able to talk about what her legal options were .
I had finally gotten my chance and I blew it , and I knew I would never get invited back .
They also wore body armor .
Although we don &apos;t have statistics for warfare throughout the Middle Ages to modern times , we know just from conventional history — the evidence was under our nose all along that there has been a reduction in socially sanctioned forms of violence .
This swallows the bridge and knocks it down .
And we think — and this is , I think , very exciting — that in the next five years or so we may be able to test for the existence of these extra dimensions .
And that &apos;s exactly what happened .
And bright young Africans are desperate to join the global community , to be successful — and they &apos;re very ambitious .
We &apos;d be growing oysters and things that would be producing high value products and food , and this would be a market driver as we build the system to larger and larger scales so that it becomes , ultimately , competitive with the idea of doing it for fuels .
We are missing the story of Nehia , a Palestinian woman in Gaza who , the minute there was a cease-fire in the last year &apos;s war , she left out of home , collected all the flour and baked as much bread for every neighbor to have , in case there is no cease-fire the day after . We are missing
Put a price on carbon . We need a CO2 tax , revenue neutral , to replace taxation on employment , which was invented by Bismarck — and some things have changed since the 19th century .

It turned out that it wasn &apos;t , that it really is a system of motivation , a system of wanting .
In fact , take these technologies and push them to their logical extreme .
We remove ourselves from our grief or from our revery and we go into our phones .
Our design was something in between a building and a house .
It &apos;s easy to imagine how particularly those parts of our bodies were quickly influenced by selection from the environment and shifted frequencies of genes that are involved in them .
That was the first concept here .
You have everything that you could ever need .
What we learn is that changing models is hard .
These children are quickly labeled as having disabilities and transferred to another institution for children with disabilities .
All I &apos;m asking is for forgiveness .
It &apos;s a bit of a personal example , in fact .
My second story is remarkable as well .
But other examples are traffic jams , stock market , society and disaster recovery , terrorism and insurgency .
( Applause ) The thing I did — I peeked .
A key attribute of our Nanopatch is that the vaccine is dry , and when it &apos;s dry it doesn &apos;t need refrigeration .

And I &apos;m here to tell you , it &apos;s wrong .
There is nothing about him that says , &quot; I am about to fight you like this . &quot;
Not to say that it shouldn &apos;t have , but that we have to get better at answering the questions that need to be considered when we think about consequences and responses .
So when people ask me how I continue to cover war , and why I continue to do it , this is why .
Bono : All right . I wish for TED to truly show the power of information , its power to rewrite the rules and transform lives , by connecting every hospital , health clinic and school in one African country .
So she is just one amongst the millions who are blind .
So what &apos;s next ?
( Laughter ) But if you do accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
We use the notion of color .
These weapons affect the poorest of the poor .
Do we get to create organic robots , where we remove the autonomy from these animals and turn them just into our playthings ?
Pictures were taken every day : day one , day two ...
By using this engaging popular format for traditional , local culture , it actually , in the Gulf , is precipitating a revival of interest in Nabati poetry , also in traditional dress and dance and music .
The discovery that these animals can also use medication opens up completely new avenues , and I think that maybe one day , we will be treating human diseases with drugs that were first discovered by butterflies , and I think that is an amazing opportunity worth pursuing .
( Applause )
And in Germany , if you would like to donate your organs — God forbid something really bad happens to you — when you get your driving license or an I.D. , you check the box saying , &quot; I would like to donate my organs . &quot;
And that &apos;s a story I &apos;m going to tell you about today .
The first one was Barnett Shale in Texas and then the Marcellus up in the Northeast across New York , Pennsylvania , West Virginia ; and Haynesville in Louisiana .
Whenever they do anything , you just say , &apos; Well , wow , I mean , how did you do that ?
You want to be transgressed .
And that &apos;s interesting , because it means that just the mechanics already stabilized this quite rapid gait , and that really good mechanics already basically simplify locomotion .
They were pragmatic .
Where do they get their water ? Where do they get their shelter ?
But if we look at companies like PUMA — Jochen Zeitz , their CEO and chairman , once challenged me at a function , saying that he &apos;s going to implement my project before I finish it .
So we started giving back .
Those kind of stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress .
And the second question is related , but slightly different .
And they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this .
But for that , the countries at entry points need to be massively supported , and then screening the people with security checks and all the other mechanisms , distributing those that are coming into all European countries , according to the possibilities of each country .
The sandworms were fine , but your favorite character ?
The real question is , how can markets be developed in rural Africa to harness the power of innovation and entrepreneurship that we know exists ?
It is essential for success .
And many organisms fit this kind of pattern .
So I &apos;m just a lawyer , I look at this range of numbers , and I say it &apos;s fair for me to say it &apos;s .05 percent who are our relevant funders in America .
( Laughter ) Nick was a young student .
And if the answer that we get from our calculations agrees with the values of those numbers that have been determined through detailed and precise experimentation , this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation for why the structure of the universe is the way it is .
There &apos;s all kinds of different things that you can imagine for that .
You think about the driverless .
We discovered a new behavior where , because of their shape , they actually roll automatically to their side to go through this artificial test bit of grass .
&quot; Can I just sit in and see what you do ? &quot;
And you &apos;ve only got about seven days to capture 50 percent of all of the Web searches that will ever be made to help your area .
So surely if a patent pool could be established to ramp up the production of military airplanes , we should be able to do something similar to tackle the HIV / AIDS epidemic .
And the women that were hired , usually for secretarial or front-office work , were all white .

Information technology grows in an exponential manner .
This top light is — I &apos;m sorry if I &apos;m making you seasick — this top light is actually a water quality display that shifts from red , when the dissolved oxygen is low , to a blue / green , when its dissolved oxygen is high .
By the way , who &apos;s holding Al Gore &apos;s phone ?
We inject our own aerosols into the atmosphere , and we have trace gases , and not just carbon dioxide — it &apos;s methane , ozone , oxides of sulfur and nitrogen .

So that &apos;s getting a lot of interest , and to show you some example of what we did in there , we actually dropped a probe , which was developed by our colleagues in Europe , we dropped a probe as we were orbiting Saturn .
What NFB wanted was not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around , but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive .
If you &apos;ve never written a line of code before in your life , do not worry .
It turns out that our first microbial communities depend a lot on how we &apos;re born .
The second thing that we learned is that individuals matter , and they matter enormously .
And these animals live in remarkably beautiful places , and in some cases , caves like this , that are very young , yet the animals are ancient .
Not because it &apos;s monotone and concrete , but because of what it symbolizes : a monster that feeds off the rest of the country , where citizens are soldiers and slaves .
You can buy cloned cologne .
We had a guest stay with a host in Uruguay , and he suffered a heart attack .
Please welcome Naná Vasconcelos .
We moved from that to becoming farmers and cultivators of information .
What is origami ?
And it was here , about 10,000 years ago , that two extraordinary inventions , agriculture and urbanism , happened roughly in the same place and at the same time .
So African agriculture , which is the place of most hunger in the world , has actually fallen precipitously as hunger has risen .
The incorporated side , the company , is doing things that it does really well .
There &apos;s no law that &apos;s been passed specifically authorizing this technique , and because of its power and potential for abuse , it &apos;s vital that we have an informed public debate .
They are sold in the name of adoption .
He has a theory of how the overall clock experience should work .
So what we do is take all these data from all these different days and pool them together to extract a long-term association pattern by applying techniques with network analysis to get a complete picture of the social structure of the colony .
Business should give more .
So what you have is one giant , interconnected , genetically identical individual that &apos;s been living for 80,000 years .
Like Muti . You ready ? Because Muti ...
Using this process , pioneers in the industry are layering up cells today .
You &apos;ve got to institutionalize a system where you actually invite the Kosovars to come and tell you what they think .
So when you &apos;re done surveying , you take all this data and you punch it into a computer and you find someone that can draw really well , and you have them draft up a map that looks something like this , and it &apos;ll show you both a bird &apos;s-eye view of the passage as well as a profile view of the passage , kind of like an ant farm view .
( Laughter ) Such it is with commitment devices .
It &apos;s not English . It &apos;s noisy English .
And this was somebody who had incredible potential to spread aspects of our message , whether it be with regards to wildlife conservation or health prevention .
Every line between them is a relationship between two people — different kinds of relationships .
For example , we actually started asking our employees , do they understand the mission of our company , and do they feel like they believe in it , can they actually influence it , and do they feel that their work actually has an impact on it ?

( Laughter ) And so there was the paper , and he proposed a three-stranded structure .
He wrote very , very positive reviews about himself . Surprise , surprise .

Let me show you a couple of examples here .
On May 11th last year , I stood alone at the North geographic Pole .
It &apos;s not a common little river that flows into a canal .
Or think about being in New York City and tracking down an intelligent cab on your smart phone so you don &apos;t have to wait in the cold to hail one .
When , all of a sudden , a girl way in the back of the auditorium , she stood up and she said , &quot; &quot; Miss !
I love when I &apos;m in the laboratory , a new spider silk sequence comes in .
Already , we can see that Apple and Microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design .
Equally untidy office there , as you can see .
And that &apos;s not just about me , that &apos;s about so many other Michiganders , U.S. citizens , who don &apos;t understand why what they are is so much more significant than who they are .
So look at this little picture .
( Laughter ) But I never became a designer . No , no , no , no . Never attempted . Never even close .
A couple of years later — so I get really excited about these things — about a couple of years later , there was a 13-month-old , she was from Canada .
Take a look at the second door and see if there &apos;s any different message .
And at this stage , if that &apos;s — so far everything sounded , like , pretty crazy — you &apos;re now about to face the most challenging decision of your life here .
I mean , because we , at this point , we can protect it .
If either of them be unwilling , the act is an offense , totally different in its nature of effects .
And that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today .
And you do that for a while , until you really feel that .
And that idea is that from the germ &apos;s-eye point of view , disease organisms have to get from one host to another , and often they have to rely on the well-being of the host to move them to another host .
There &apos;s no dinosaurs yet ; just this slow , saurian , scaly , nasty , swampy place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes .
Also , the way I perceive beauty has changed , because when I look at someone , I hear their face , so someone might look very beautiful but sound terrible .

The breakfast that we eat as we sit down to check our email in the morning is still transported at great distances , usually at the expense of the local , more resilient food systems that would have supplied that in the past , which we &apos;ve so effectively devalued and dismantled .
And here you can see these wooden effigies of the ancestors , so these are people who have already been buried , already had a funeral ceremony .
And I think that people have legitimate concerns about the balance between transparency and secrecy .
These losses , they feel , emotionally , they feel very different from what we actually thought about it when markets were going up . &quot; &quot; So we &apos;re probably not doing a great job when it comes to risk taking .
Now , in their religiosity , in their naivete , my mom and dad , which I believed them to be forever , as they said they were , my mom and dad conceived that I had the Devil inside of me .
That &apos;s twice as many numbers as words that each of us speaks in a lifetime .
Now &apos;s a chance for Dimitri to kind of reassure and calm Milo down .
And he worked on what were to become these nine health goals — what were we aiming at ?
Now Albert Einstein is not some dead white guy with weird hair .
This is a kind of a blowing straw .
Let &apos;s talk about what scale looks like at Twitter .
It labels &quot; &quot; developing countries , &quot; &quot; — I can read from the list here — developing countries : Republic of Korea — South Korea .
This nation will become great again .
There is great confusion when the two look at each other .
Ladies and gentleman , this was one of the most concerning international emergencies in public health we &apos;ve ever seen .

It has a fairly substantial number of asteroids between the orbit of the Earth out through — to the orbit of Jupiter .
Everything there is about the Great Leader .
And broadly applicable across many platforms .
It took him three months .
What if , out there , others are asking and answering similar questions ?
And the cell on the right there fires whenever there &apos;s a boundary to the south , whether it &apos;s the drop at the edge of the table or a wall or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart .
And they may start to make their way through one of the valleys of the Shephelah up into the mountains , because what they want to do is occupy the highland area right by Bethlehem and split the Kingdom of Israel in two .
In Sri Lanka , a decades-long civil war between the Tamil minority and the Sinhala majority led to a bloody climax in 2009 , after perhaps as many as 100,000 people had been killed since 1983 .
There are three reasons why this is the case .
And I think that there &apos;s theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with RNA , but I &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them .
Now , the vast majority of activity on Twitter puts no one in harm &apos;s way .
That kind of beautiful language only goes &quot; &quot; skin deep , but ugly cuts clean to the bone , &quot; &quot; as the writer Dorothy Parker once put it .
It serves no good purpose .
It has never been done .
I was born with some form of disease .
And we do care about planets like the Earth because by now we understood that life as a chemical system really needs a smaller planet with water and with rocks and with a lot of complex chemistry to originate , to emerge , to survive .
And we can walk through the reasons for that , but basically the small cell took on the order of one to two months to get results from , whereas the larger , faster-growing cell takes only two days .
Woman : I &apos;d make my very own walking stick .
My dad , John Ferren , who died when I was 15 , was an artist by both passion and profession , as is my mom , Rae .
But we began with the idea of one child at a time .
The reason we envisioned using the CRISPR system for genome engineering is because cells have the ability to detect broken DNA and repair it .
And my message goes out not only to Google , but to all believers in the faith of code around the world .
Because if enough people do it , we can change society &apos;s definition of success away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins , to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like .
It was a little reckless , but you know , I was 16 .
And I was part of that .
In fact , it &apos;s one of the biggest problems with chemotherapy today .
So we said , &quot; &quot; Well , these will be on round tables and the order around the table had to be the same , so that at my site , I would be , if you will , real and then at each other &apos;s site you &apos;d have these plastic heads .
Third , someone has something you &apos;ve never even heard of before .
And it raises an existential question , which is , if I &apos;m having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness , why am I not visible in the photograph , and where is this time and place ?

Well , ever since I was a kid , I &apos;d been thinking about systematizing knowledge and somehow making it computable .
Well , I remember in third grade , I had this moment where my father , who never takes off from work , he &apos;s a classical blue collar , a working-class immigrant person , going to school to see his son , how he &apos;s doing , and the teacher said to him , he said , &quot; &quot; You know , John is good at math and art . &quot; &quot; And he kind of nodded , you know ?
They can throw out a target — it &apos;s a carpet shaped like a seal — and in will come a white shark , a curious critter that will come right up to our 16-ft. boat .
And to contrast that , you can see the most important institution in the world , the World Bank , is an organization of the government , by the government , for the governments .
Oil . Oil . This was a big topic .
So what can we do ?
We don &apos;t know what that &apos;s going to do to you , not in the long term , and not even very much in the short term .

A few months ago , a South African lawyer visited me in my office and he said , &quot; &quot; I wanted to meet you .
But the idea that we can gently grow there with a few minor hiccups is just wrong , and it &apos;s dangerously wrong , because it means we &apos;re not getting ready for what &apos;s really going to happen .
Pshh , pouring rain , couldn &apos;t see a thing .
You run it through a new kind of printer called a wax printer .
And you know it &apos;s not real science unless you use guinea pigs , and apparently this guinea pig is called Tiffany , and this YouTube user claims it is the first rodent on Earth that was motion-magnified .
Greatest runner . She would challenge anybody .
They are telling their own story , bypassing the official narrative .
The tumor slowed their rate of growth , but they still grew rapidly , doubling in size over a period of two weeks .
And one of the things that &apos;s emerged in my short time here is that TED has an identity .
( Applause )
All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit , playing .
And you &apos;ll say : &quot; &quot; Ah , that &apos;s because there is a reason , here ! &quot; &quot; Dear friends , I already heard all the reasons .
JH : Thanks guys .
It was taken by this thing , which is called the Voyager spacecraft .
I see wheelchairs bought and sold like used cars .
And you could do us a great service if you would add a culinary program to your program . &quot; &quot; Because back then , we were building a trades program .
But it &apos;s a kind of indirect argument .
Why are you so passionate ? &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; Oh Gayle , this is actually my third business .
Well , African leaders , almost exclusively .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I found your camera at Lollapalooza this summer .

I picked Disney because they have what we call 100 percent penetration in our society .
( Applause )
If the Al-Qaeda base was to be established near Ghazni , we would hit them very hard , and it would be very , very difficult for the Taliban to protect them .
In some countries , you couldn &apos;t do that .

It &apos;s by Astor Piazzolla , an Argentine composer .
Danny makes it look as if a person &apos;s skin has actually been removed .
A hundred years ago , it &apos;s certainly true that to drive a car you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car and how the ignition timing worked and all sorts of things .
MK : I imagine being grateful , too , right ?
Ten years later , I returned to Kenya to do just that .
What issues deeply concern you ?
But another really important difference is how they get their greater equality .
And this is one of the things that we are looking for everywhere .
And even something as innocuous as a single-design chair , like this one by Arne Jacobsen , is a persuasive technology , because , again , it communicates an idea of the good life : a good life — a life that you , as a designer , consent to by saying , &quot; &quot; In a good life , goods are produced as sustainably or unsustainably as this chair .
We want to say , &quot; &quot; This is just the way it is .
This is different . Here , we &apos;re talking about the communication of pertinent information to stakeholders of organizations : employees , customers , business partners , shareholders , and so on .
Perhaps one should consider zodiac in reverse , as those Tiger and Goat babies will face much less competition .
Well , we can go back to the network structure of ideas to do that .
We know this .
His name is Nyota .
I was an outsider who had come back to Iran to find my place , but I was not in a position to be critical of the government or the ideology of the Islamic Revolution .
It wasn &apos;t going to be our traditional residential neighborhoods as we had before , and urban agriculture , while a very productive and successful intervention happening in Detroit , was not the only answer , that what we had to do is look at these areas where we had significant vacancy but still had a significant number of population of what could be new , productive , innovative , and entrepreneurial uses that could stabilize those communities , where still nearly 300,000 residents lived .
And people always say , &quot; &quot; Why do that ?
That &apos;s better than a glowing chicken .
Because we have 300 million microbloggers in China .
Let me tell you the story of Shriram , an 18 month boy in Bihar , a northern state in India .
How come , then , it &apos;s not so expected to be selective when we go to an art gallery ?
We did the line install over the summer .
This is our delivery army , and we &apos;re just one organization .
Okay . What if you think they &apos;re fighting ?
Woman : You still have to report the incident .
I think I &apos;m from Mars for them , and they are for me , but somehow we all manage to work together , and I think , productively .
Now before I get into the details of how the voice is made and let you listen to it , I need to give you a real quick speech science lesson . Okay ?
So for the climate , history may judge that the banking crisis happened at just the wrong time .
They look like TV cameras , monitors , annoying radio mics .
And the British people were still upset about losing the Revolution , so they decided to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture of General Washington in the only outhouse , where he &apos;d have to encounter it .
And there are thousands of other examples of this happening — of video-driven evolution of skills , ranging from the physical to the artful .
Now you &apos;re thinking , give me a break .
Man : You know how expensive those are .
Now , I &apos;d like you to think about the following : actions are within your control , not entirely , but to a large extent .
Today , I devote all of my time to working on this problem , and I &apos;ll go wherever the science takes me .
But I &apos;d like to relay to you a childhood experience of mine that really made me see the ocean differently , and it &apos;s become the foundation of my work because , I feel like , if in a day , I can see the ocean differently , then I can evoke that same kind of change in others , especially kids .
I mean , look , this animal is trying to fight back this spear from this soldier .
If we are going to stop the spread of HIV in our lifetime , then that is the change we need to spread .
Thing is , in science , you basically have to tell the funding agencies what you &apos;re going to discover before they &apos;ll give you the money .
And the first number I thought of was ...
What do we mean to talk about a straight line on a curved surface ?
So , the gallery wanted me to have another show in two years , which meant that I really had to paint these paintings much faster than I had ever done them . And I — they started to become more political , and I picked areas that sort of were in the news or that I had some feeling about , and I began doing these things .
We placed it inside a box with magnetic sensors , and that allowed us to create this 3-dimensional point cloud and visualize the complex architecture of the silkworm cocoon .
When I was thinking to come here , what best title I wanted to say to my talk , I didn &apos;t find this .
It turns out that my father was an M.D. , actually studied hormones . I told him many times that I was tired , thirsty , not feeling very good .
I could see the blood pulsing in her neck .
And I realized that we had a frontier here , a very important one , that it was just a matter of changing the perspective , and the web could be actually used , already used , as a colossal and uncontrollable and highly anarchical TV channel , TV network , and anyone with very basic skills and very basic equipment , even someone like me who had this little stuttering issue , so if it happens , bear with me please , even someone like me could become a broadcaster .
We also see a big DIY movement .
There are .
But what if we put more focus on quality ?
As you can see , there &apos;s a kind of odd , regular pattern in the data , twin peaks every year .
He said the key is he never took sugar with his tea .
&quot; &quot; Female soldiers : Become a part of history .
E = MC squared required an intuitive leap , and then you had to do the analysis afterwards .
I have to have trust in them and vice versa .
The revival of democratic politics will come from you , and I mean all of you .
You know , I love Apple computers . I &apos;m obsessed .
We passed a bunch of rules to regulate the financial industry in response to the recent collapse .
Anybody who dismisses the thought of a nuclear weapon being used by a terrorist is kidding themselves .
Little Miss Sunshine was hot stuff , The kind of girl when you looked at her you forgot stuff , But for him , there was no forgetting her , The minute he saw her her image burned in his retina , She was out of this world , and she accepted him , Something about this girl meant he knew whenever she was next to him , Things weren ’ t as dark as they seemed , and he dared to dream , Shadows were nowhere to be seen ; when she was there he beamed , His eyes would light up in ways that can ’ t be faked , When she grinned her rays erased the razor-tipped words of hate ,
Those fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans .

That &apos;s what makes the difference between political talking like this and really going for the important thing , a better life for people .
I said assigning a less than 20 percent probability would be a mistake in light of the current evidence we have .
And what &apos;s interesting is , by playing with these signals , we can completely control speed , heading and type of gait .
So , we can see far more detail in our galaxy than anyplace else .
And this gets me back to my research .
Again , now we &apos;re past TED 1 , but just around the time of TED 2 , and what I &apos;d like to mention here is , even though you could imagine intelligence in the device , I look today at some of the work being done about the Internet of Things , and I think it &apos;s kind of tragically pathetic , because what has happened is people take the oven panel and put it on your cell phone , or the door key onto your cell phone , just taking it and bringing it to you , and in fact that &apos;s actually what you don &apos;t want .
( Applause ) So in about seven years of doing nuclear research , I started out with a dream to make a &quot; &quot; star in a jar , &quot; &quot; a star in my garage , and I ended up meeting the president and developing things that I think can change the world , and I think other kids can too .
This was my first job .
And the state &apos;s key witness in Ron &apos;s case was , in the end , the actual perpetrator .
That &apos;s a 2,000 mile journey .
Well , hackers in the back row replied , &quot; Then stop arresting us . &quot;
WK : I think we have discovered a very important issue in the Arab world — that people care , people care about this great transformation .
Even when the information is terrible , the visual can be quite beautiful .
A simpler way of thinking of it is that we have gone from a world of local control , then we went to a world of central control , and now we &apos;re in a world of people control .
In reality , the Higgs field is just slightly on , not zero but 10,000 trillion times weaker than its fully on value , a bit like a light switch that &apos;s got stuck just before the off position .
Prospera : I will plague them all , even to roaring .
In terms of where we are in science with DNA identification capacities and so on , it &apos;s not that far off .
I &apos;ll show you a few examples of this now .
Green means the student &apos;s already proficient .
So , I do want to say , at the outset , that I think compassion &apos;s great .
Guess where those places are ?
So they may be looking at a light in the ceiling , or they may be isolated in the corner , or they might be engaged in these repetitive movements , in self-stimulatory movements that led them nowhere .
Now notice , in a period which is dominated by a mono-polar world , you have fixed alliances — NATO , the Warsaw Pact .
But unfortunately Molas , even though they don &apos;t school , they still get caught in nets as by-catch .
Woman : You wouldn &apos;t ? ( Girl : No . ) Woman : You &apos;d think that was fine .

So he tries to give the shepherd his armor , and the shepherd says , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t wear this stuff . &quot; &quot; The Biblical verse is , &quot; &quot; I cannot wear this for I have not proved it , &quot; &quot; meaning , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve never worn armor before . You &apos;ve got to be crazy . &quot; &quot; So he reaches down instead on the ground and picks up five stones and puts them in his shepherd &apos;s bag and starts to walk down the mountainside to meet the giant .
So my wish for everyone is to be able to be their authentic self 24 / 7 , that would be the ultimate .
And what was also one of the bigger projects around that was moving 13 full-size cities up out of the reservoir , and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships .
So one of the problems with some of the studies that we &apos;ve done is that because they &apos;re all done using Mechanical Turk , these are not people &apos;s real passwords .
But if we give it a little bit more thought , like a paper clip .
For the past two years , 500 of these villages where these are have not needed any food aid — they &apos;re self-sufficient .
( Applause ) And if you &apos;ve got a scientific problem like that , you can &apos;t solve it by holding a head count , and saying , &quot; &quot; More of us say yes than say no . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Apart from that , some of the heads count more than others .
I understood that I was wrong again .
But this technology still requires a conversation .
( Laughter ) But we have no idea why it does that .
The UVC , the most energetic type , was occluded by the Earth &apos;s atmosphere .
How poetic .
And the way I like to describe it is it &apos;s kind of like a math professor .
girls .
Now we can take these responses and compare them to the responses in other listeners in the same brain area .
I mean , it must be true , because we &apos;ve had two Hollywood blockbusters since that time , and this paradigm , from 1980 to about 2000 , totally changed how we geologists thought about catastrophes .
And the other , of course , is a birth control pill , which , in a very simple way , fundamentally changed the structure of society by changing the role of women in it by providing to them the opportunity to make reproductive choices .
It doesn &apos;t make quite as much money as body humor I &apos;m sure — ( Laughter ) but nevertheless , what makes us treasure you and adore you .
For those of you who don &apos;t know , we &apos;re in the middle of the sixth mass extinction .
A hundred years ago , guess what ?
Edicts like , &quot; &quot; Defer judgment , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Go for quantity . &quot; &quot; And somehow that seems wrong .
And thanks to that , you really have an amazing machine to record all the bone motion in great detail .
Now , at this point , a number of you are probably wondering well , what are you waiting for , to put on the market a game that would be good for the attention of my grandmother and that she would actually enjoy , or a game that would be great to rehabilitate the vision of my grandson who has amblyopia , for example ?
So you &apos;d be surprised to find that Poem 1 was written by the very human poet Gertrude Stein .

We then put in the DBS electrodes and we wait for a month or a year , and the areas in red represent the areas where we increase glucose utilization .
I feel like our civilization works when this is a vast cultural heritage that we all share and that we know without having to outsource it to our devices , to our search engines and our smartphones .
Of course they are , they are a mercantilist nation .
One out of every seven people .
Depression , for example , is the third-leading cause of disability , alongside conditions such as diarrhea and pneumonia in children .
How much oil is stored in all of China ?
( Laughter ) We are paid to be children , to basically go to the edge and discover what is out there .
Thank you very much .
We &apos;d come in with some prototype underneath a black cloth and we &apos;d put it on the conference table , and we &apos;d pull off the black cloth and everybody would &quot; &quot; ooh &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ah . &quot; &quot; That was a really good time .
And the amoeba dubia doesn &apos;t look like much , except that each of you has about 3.2 billion letters , which is what makes you you , as far as gene code inside each of your cells , and this little amoeba which , you know , sits in water in hundreds and millions and billions , turns out to have 620 billion base pairs of gene code inside .
If you &apos;re playing against a very good opponent , they may distribute it in that green area , which is the prior distribution , making it hard for you to return .
These individuals have committed acts of unspeakable evil .
For all of these different critically important problems or critically important areas that we want to solve problems in , we basically know nothing at all .
But unfortunately , the ocean is opaque , and we can &apos;t see what &apos;s going on .
And I stood on that stage with Dizzy Gillespie on sound check on a Wednesday afternoon , and I said , &quot; &quot; Dizzy , why would you come to a black-run center in the middle of an industrial park with a high crime rate that doesn &apos;t even have a reputation in music ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Because I heard you built the center and I didn &apos;t believe that you did it , and I wanted to see for myself .
But a gene turns on and resorbs the tail , gets rid of it .
Cynthia Breazeal : So Kismet interacted with people like kind of a non-verbal child or pre-verbal child , which I assume was fitting because it was really the first of its kind .

and bingo . That is all you have to do .
They said , &quot; &quot; We look for employees who are great with our customers , who empower their teams , who negotiate effectively , who are able to manage conflict well , and are overall great communicators . &quot; &quot; Which element of leadership does that equate to ?

&quot; It &apos;s a glamorous shade of pink . &quot;
Now you are just looking at about 7.4 billion people with the map drawn in proportion to those people .
What they would do is they would explain what was going on and then dictate information that the professor would transcribe onto the many motorized blackboards in the front of the class , and then we &apos;d have a discussion .
Probably not , but people like me do .
Those deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence .
It &apos;s going to depend if they &apos;re wealthy or impoverished .
So I talked — I had to come up with a plan to figure these things out .
Imagine if I had to feel even a hundred other people &apos;s suffering .
There were people at my table who thought it was , you know , fantastic .
There you are in my ear .
It &apos;s a special feeling .
And so we need a theory that unifies the very large and the very small , which we don &apos;t yet have .
The audience is led to make assumptions or elaborations that are perfectly reasonable , but do not , in fact , match what is being done in front of them .
They had deployed all the right incentives , They paid professionals to write and edit thousands of articles .
Was it about me as a child refugee , or as a woman who set up a high-tech software company back in the 1960s , one that went public and eventually employed over 8,500 people ?
This is an example of bio-mimicry , which is something we &apos;re really starting to look a lot more for .
What we need is another hero generation . Those of us who are alive in the United States of America today especially , but also the rest of the world , have to somehow understand that history has presented us with a choice — just as Jill &#91; Bolte &#93; Taylor was figuring out how to save her life while she was distracted by the amazing experience that she was going through .
And those were then distributed to DJs who have made hundreds of songs using that source material .
We knew there &apos;s a mechanism called homologous recombination that biology uses to repair DNA that can put pieces together .
It &apos;s just like the one Cervantes wrote about in &quot; &quot; Don Quixote , &quot; &quot; which by the way is the root of the word &quot; &quot; quixotry , &quot; &quot; the highest-scoring Scrabble word of all time , 365 points .
Did life start here and was it transported there ?
So , you know , the thing is to remember that because otherwise , 10 years from now , we &apos;ll be back here trying to tell this story again .
So they inhaled it , but they are not aware of it .
So my coauthors and I have used computers , the greatest tool of our time , to assist people &apos;s imagination and help them imagine what it might be like to go into the future .
I went to poker nights .
Yes , they do a whole bunch of other stuff , but they &apos;re very good at this .
He &apos;s also interested in the transformation of the arm , the hand , to the wing .
So I decided to slice these up with the tool that I make by — I sharpen the end of a needle into a blade .
Where were you ?
And there &apos;s this great novel that Arthur Clarke wrote twice , called &quot; &quot; Against the Fall of Night &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The City and the Stars . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re both wonderful and largely the same , except that computers happened in between .
At this point , something else happened .
Now , take a look at the ancient ancestor of banana .
It &apos;s true what they say , and I didn &apos;t believe it until it happened to me .

And I believe , personally , that we &apos;re on the verge and that , with the presence and help of people like you here , we can bring about the prophecy of Isaiah .
And these clouds , these rarer clouds , remind us that the exotic can be found in the everyday .
And it &apos;s driven and propelled forward by new leaders , like many of the people here , by new tools , like the ones we &apos;ve seen here , and by new pressures .
They can &apos;t do it naturally , so what they do with this thing is they take a spoon , take some cells out of an adult gaur &apos;s mouth , code , take the cells from that and insert it into a fertilized cow &apos;s egg , reprogram cow &apos;s egg — different gene code .
This is actually a desktop inkjet printer , but instead of using ink , we &apos;re using cells .
My footprint &apos;s smaller , I &apos;m lessening pollution , I feel better about the animals , I &apos;m even saving money .
Today we have 20 million refugees in the world .
And that , if there &apos;s no more rain , there &apos;ll be nothing to drink , or to eat ? &quot; &quot; I heard that , and my eyes welled up and I went , &quot; &quot; Oh , my !
I had other options , but I didn &apos;t choose them .
In reward terms , it &apos;s not money ; it &apos;s not being given cash — that &apos;s nice — it &apos;s doing stuff with our peers , watching us , collaborating with us .
When we think about accidents , we usually consider them to be harmful , unfortunate or even dangerous , and they certainly can be .
So what do I say ?
But then , of course , the body has many parts , and things grow at different rates , and they have different sizes and different people ; however , not so with the interior .
In fact , so woeful was our telephone service that a Member of Parliament stood up in 1984 and complained about this .
And the result , as so often in science , was boring : Fifty percent of their food was medicinal . Fifty percent was not .
And president Medvedev of Russia , for example , pronounced in 2008 this was the beginning of the end of United States power .
Even more importantly , this common culture enables international peacebuilders to ignore the micro-level tensions that often jeopardize the macro-level settlements .
Thank you .
For example , I &apos;m currently examining correlations between the frequency of a patient &apos;s nightly wandering and his or her daily activities and diet .
We can understand functionality . This is really important .
While it may appear to be a completely chaotic place , when you see it from above , there seems to be a whole grid of waterways and canals connecting each and every home .
So , people of the TED community , I put it to you that what the world needs now is nuclear energy .
Every dot is a person . We make the dot size proportional to people &apos;s body size ; so bigger dots are bigger people .
Metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia , in which we understand one concept in the context of another .
So Gneezy and Rustichini run this experiment for a dozen weeks — run the fine for a dozen weeks — and then they say , &quot; &quot; Okay , that &apos;s it . All done ; fine . &quot; &quot; And then a really interesting thing happens : Nothing changes .
( Laughter ) What a handsome cat .
NT : Another student in the first year of AIMS was Shehu .
The evidence from genetic data is that the human population around this time , roughly 70,000 years ago , crashed to fewer than 2,000 individuals .
What can you do to a symmetrical object , move it in some way , so it looks the same as before you moved it ?
So we &apos;re looking for a balance , a focused relaxation where we can allow thoughts to come and go without all the usual involvement .
And in the process , what that allows us to do is to redirect a lot more of our growth back into existing communities that could use a boost , and have the infrastructure in place , instead of continuing to tear down trees and to tear up the green space out at the edges .
The idea is , let &apos;s have some sensors that listen to these storms , this electrical firing , and see if you can , in the same time that it takes for this storm to leave the brain and reach the legs or the arms of an animal — about half a second — let &apos;s see if we can read these signals , extract the motor messages that are embedded in it , translate it into digital commands and send it to an artificial device that will reproduce the voluntary motor wheel of that brain in real time .
And another 50 percent of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous .
These effects were all unanticipated , and yet we &apos;re discovering they &apos;re predictable .
And yet , McDonald &apos;s sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year .
She got pregnant , ran to the bush to have the baby , but you know , her body was very immature , and she ended up having obstructed labor .
And so there are a number of atavisms that can happen .
And finally , you could rightly ask , why care about this ?
Man 5 : Failed writer-alcoholic brand .
So this graph here , I &apos;m going to show you now .
And a few meters ahead of us , there was a place where a tree had fallen out of the bank , and its branches were touching the water , and it was shadowy .
We have perception , computation and non-visual interfaces .
Man : I &apos;m sorry .
We &apos;ve also talked about concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
( Laughter ) Here is the green one .
But through luck and an awful lot of perseverance , I was able to get computer time around the city .
Now you may say , &quot; Okay , so we &apos;re eating 500 grams just by accident . &quot;
And then I came across a team at Harvard University that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it , instead of in brain research , towards diagnosing brain disorders in children .
And a book , if you had a book , is about a megabyte , so — you know , if you had it in Microsoft Word .
There &apos;s nothing like the feeling which invades you when after months of hard thinking , you finally understand the right reasoning to solve your problem .
A recent study looking at penalty shootouts in football shows that players who represent countries with a very bad record in penalty shootouts , like , for example , England , tend to be quicker to take their shots than countries with a better record , and presumably as a result , they &apos;re more likely to miss .
Secondly , the majority of that growth comes from white migrants .
The machine made this decision for us .
Her system can predict the likelihood of depression months before the onset of any symptoms — months before .
They &apos;re the school &apos;s biggest risk and also its best bet .
I grew up in an enormously traditional family .
If you were to just completely ignore human ethics for a second and slice up my brain right now , you would see that there was an amazing number of brain regions that were active while recalling that memory .
And it &apos;s kind of brilliant .
And there was a building , a new building , going up , that was being built right outside , across the street from our hotel .
( Applause ) I told you in the beginning that it was necessary for us to plant about 2.5 million trees of about 200 different species in order to rebuild the ecosystem .
So , Mr. Gore , thank you .
It was a fairy tale , and then we retired .
And you all know roughly the story .
They may be a reaction to bigger trends .
I did a little bit of research on this notion , and it might calm some folk down to know that the idea of a net guaranteed minimum income has been championed by those frothing-at-the-mouth socialists Friedrich Hayek , Richard Nixon and Milton Friedman .
First problem is just , well , where should we start ?
Well , now we &apos;re going to the Bahamas to meet a remarkable group of dolphins that I &apos;ve been working with in the wild for the last 28 years .
That &apos;s why , a few years later , I joined with a group of college friends in bringing the Make Poverty History campaign to Australia .
It &apos;s also interesting to think about what other things are — so if these all enabled great values , why should we think that evolution has happened to provide us with all the modalities we would need to engage with other values that there might be ?
Being close to the content — that &apos;s the content really is close to my heart .
And what has happened ?
And if we were able to arrange spaces where we could come across works where we would be told , use these works of art to cement these ideas in your mind , we would get a lot more out of art .
If we don &apos;t supply vitamins to the prisoners , it &apos;s a war crime . &quot; &quot; And the next morning , supplies of vitamin B12 are delivered to the camp , and the prisoners begin to recover .
( Laughter ) We can &apos;t sit idly by here either .
&quot; &quot; Should we be there ?
They &apos;re discoveries of people and the way people are , and new leadership .
Of course these microbial fuel cells , they contain microbes .
And I said , well , by whom ? I mean most , you know — there ’ s three attitudes : You ’ re right , and I don ’ t know why , which is the most rational one at this point .
When Iran &apos;s ideological impulses collided with its strategic interests , the strategic interests always prevailed .
And once again , I &apos;d like to look back to prehistory to say something about it .
And in closing , when you have a moment of peace or quiet in these very busy few days or perhaps afterwards , spare a thought for that person you thought about who has a mental illness , or persons that you thought about who have mental illness , and dare to care for them . Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
So when Ruslan came the day after , before he put the first question to me , I asked him , &quot; &quot; How is your son today ? Is he feeling better ? &quot; &quot; Ruslan was taken by surprise .

So they concluded that because they saw activation in the insula , this meant the subjects loved their iPhones .
You accumulate knowledge throughout your life in memories .
Nothing in the box .
Anyway , I was looking through this book , wondering if I was much crazier than I thought I was , or maybe it &apos;s not a good idea to diagnose yourself with a mental disorder if you &apos;re not a trained professional , or maybe the psychiatry profession has a kind of strange desire to label what &apos;s essentially normal human behavior as a mental disorder .
And only a few people can do it .
And , by the end , you &apos;re going to see clusters of obese and non-obese individuals within the network .

One of them creates , perhaps , the primary product — the thing we think we &apos;re paying for — the other one creates a context within which we can enjoy and appreciate that product .
Here &apos;s what our trawl samples from the plastic soup our ocean has become look like .
And this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing : understanding who &apos;s the audience .
And it never fails to engage .
But at least I am hopeful that we should be able to fight this war with better medical imaging techniques in the way that is not blind .
Yet for the last year , it has been Ebola that has stolen all of the headlines and the fear .
The most kind of crude way in which we have it , are things like horoscopes .
( Laughter ) But my neighbor only knows two types of countries — industrialized and developing .
This is what your music looks like , but here &apos;s its visual abstraction .
But what &apos;s interesting to me is that this was the first case of a mechanical device suffering , at least indirectly , from a human disease .
And that &apos;s their problem ; we &apos;re eating them to death .
This is in the courtyard of a twelfth-century alchemist .
Second , we need to create the space for what I call &quot; &quot; managed dissent . &quot; &quot; If we are to shift paradigms , if we are to make breakthroughs , if we are to destroy myths , we need to create an environment in which expert ideas are battling it out , in which we &apos;re bringing in new , diverse , discordant , heretical views into the discussion , fearlessly , in the knowledge that progress comes about , not only from the creation of ideas , but also from their destruction — and also from the knowledge that , by surrounding ourselves by divergent , discordant , heretical views .
So this evolutionary foil safeguards the plant against these rather cute animals , and protects it and of course ensures its survival .
We need to connect the information always with the action , and then that action feeds back into different information , and it creates , of course , a feedback loop .
Here &apos;s quick history sidebar for you : no woman ever burnt her bra in the &apos; 60s .
And it ’ s not a diet .
That satellite tag will now have your shark phone home and send in a message .
( Applause ) So that &apos;s what it is all about .
But that was no end .
If you &apos;re a mammal , the most dangerous time in life is the first few hours after birth .
Jim went three miles went down , and I went about three miles away from the studio and photographed this in a garage .
Now , there was one small catch .
We got a bunch of naive subjects in , we didn &apos;t tell them anything about the robot , sat them down in front of the robot and said , talk to the robot .
But she told me , &quot; &quot; Mom , it &apos;s not American . &quot; &quot; She said she is in love — in love with a nice Chinese girl .
Thank you .
If you want to become a fossil , you actually need to die somewhere where your bones will be rapidly buried .
And yet , somehow you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life .
And what &apos;s under that is what we call bureaucracy .
There is over 500 separate components .
This is a tunnel that &apos;s abandoned in Hell &apos;s Kitchen .
I was in a land of plenty .
As you go into another community , there are bound to be changes .
This is the first house I built .
It &apos;s earthquake-resistant .
They help with digging and work crew organization .
Halfway through this process , I met the president of Kiribati , President Anote Tong .
For me , the issue about aid — I don &apos;t think that Africans need to now go all the way over to the other side and feel bad about aid .
We have fought to be here .
The headline says , &quot; &quot; NSA broke privacy rules thousands of times per year . &quot; &quot; Tell us about that .
The book designer &apos;s responsibility is threefold : to the reader , to the publisher and , most of all , to the author .
Many of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad .
( Applause ) Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm &apos;s length from politics ?
It turned out to be incredibly successful .
( Laughter ) DP : Hi , could I have 400 with a schmear ?
If you &apos;re in the military and you &apos;re in a lot of combat , you &apos;re no more likely to kill yourself than if you weren &apos;t .
It &apos;s not like the teddy bear .
We &apos;re essentially against lying .
You know , skiers pray for snow ?
And yet , just like Salman , they were lifelong , tenacious self-learners , and our home was stacked with thousands of books , records and artwork .
If necessary you can put babies in your ads .
I went to Yale for graduate school , studied in a building of this style by Le Corbusier , affectionately known in our business as Brutalism .
And this is called , &quot; &quot; Swallowing the Bitterness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I used to believe America was the best .
We &apos;ve also gone on with what was initially our primary population of people with above-the-elbow amputations .
And the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information to move ahead to protect some of these significant hope spots , hotspots .
You and I weave together entire stories of people , places and things the moment we lay our gaze on them .
This is an image that won us a competition for an exhibition pavilion for the Swiss Expo 2002 on Lake Neuchatel , near Geneva .
If you go into the military , you &apos;ll find lots of Carl Nordens as well .
And that &apos;s when it dawned on me : This kid had only ever experienced disabled people as objects of inspiration .
And we thought a solar-powered plane wouldn &apos;t really make sense , but you could do it and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power and maybe help that field .
It &apos;s like the water of the stream ; it never sits still .
CA : How about you , Melinda , though ? Can you ? ( Laughter ) You never know .
So there &apos;s no point in looking . &quot; &quot; And that , of course , that set back the progress of radio astronomy by about 20 years .
Fundamentally , these technologies exist today .
They did it by focusing on the things that matter to their business , like wasting less energy and water in their manufacturing processes ; like making sure the CEO contracts had the CEOs incentivized for the long-term results of the company and the communities they served , not just quarterly results ; or building a first class culture that would have higher employee loyalty , retention and productivity .
Now the other issue comes with , not just the ability to tell pitches apart , but the ability to tell sounds apart .
A lot of these people are highly educated and skilled workers .
And politically , it was awful .
We can digitize the Collect Pond and the streams , and see where they actually are in the geography of the city today .
The redefined physician is human , knows she &apos;s human , accepts it , isn &apos;t proud of making mistakes , but strives to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else .
I must say that before I went to the U.S. , I didn &apos;t consciously identify as African .
So that &apos;s what &apos;s exciting to me , seeing how data can change my perspective and change my mind midstream — beautiful , lovely data .
So this presumably means that these Denisovans had been more widespread in the past , since we don &apos;t think that the ancestors of Melanesians were ever in Siberia .
Now , when I was a young man — 40 years ago , the country was very , very poor with lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty .
That &apos;s one actor , the Security Council .
But there is another point .
And so we , in the mixing process , have to develop the gluten , we have to activate the leaven or the yeast , and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly .
Now there is one issue that is hyper-partisan , and where there is one party that is just spend , spend , spend , we don &apos;t care , spend some more , and that of course is Republicans when it comes to military defense spending .
Well , this is the question the Edge foundation asked this year , and four of the respondents said , &quot; &quot; SETI . &quot; &quot; Why ?
Now then , you guys have — you have a minute comeback on him to pick up a point he said , challenge it , whatever .
You remember that I told you , when I received the farm from my parents that was my paradise , that was the farm .
Embalming is a cheat code , providing the illusion that death and then decay are not the natural end for all organic life on this planet .
So it really , really helps the criminal investigation to establish the cause of death , and in some cases also directing the investigation in the right direction to find out who the killer really was .
And it felt kind of like being president , actually .
There &apos;s such a disconnect .
Well , President John F. Kennedy said something about this that is just spot on : &quot; &quot; There are risks and costs to a program of action , but they are far less than the long-range risks and costs of comfortable inaction . &quot; &quot; I can appreciate that there is estimation risk in this , but since this is based on widespread scientific consensus , the odds that it &apos;s not completely wrong are better than the odds that our house will burn down or we &apos;ll get in a car accident .
They acted sweet .
The machines we build continue to suffer from mechanical failures .
And furthermore , he released Mr. Carrillo so that he could aid in the preparation of his own defense if the prosecution decided to retry him .
BG : Okay , so we &apos;ll let you go and save it , and rescue it .
So it may be that , in certain halls , this dynamic may well work . ( Music ) It may be that in other halls , they &apos;re simply not going to experience that at all and so therefore , my level of soft , gentle playing may have to be ... ( Music ) Do you see what I mean ? So , because of this explosion in access to sound , especially through the deaf community , this has not only affected how music institutions , how schools for the deaf treat sound — and not just as a means of therapy — although of course , being a participator of music , that definitely is the case as well .
And right in the middle of a negotiation I &apos;d be able to get the answer .
( Laughter ) I love data .
Right ? It &apos;s pretty big .
They &apos;ve been shaped by two powerful evolutionary forces : natural selection , the struggle for survival , and sexual selection , the struggle for reproductive opportunity .
It &apos;s easy to simply ignore them and it &apos;s even easier when the government goes to great lengths to keep them hidden .
And that bicycle cable can open or close a hand or a hook or bend an elbow .
However , the implications of those results — of a possible environment within this moon that could support prebiotic chemistry , and perhaps life itself — were so exciting that , in the intervening two years , we have focused more on Enceladus .
Now , often people ask me , &quot; What did you learn by studying choice ? &quot;
Again in 2009 , we see a paper that says that trocars account for over half of all major complications in laparoscopic surgery .
We need to bring health and food and education and respect for all God &apos;s citizens , all God &apos;s children , remembering mama eternal .
So , you have a near-permanent solution for reinvasion of termites .
CE : And all of a sudden , everybody &apos;s reawoken .
( Laughter ) Now , you see the magnet fell really slowly .
Security has meant everything else .
No sophistication , no class , no dignity , no history .
So , I &apos;m going to begin by applying this idea to diarrheal diseases .
So how can we tell the difference between the fears worth listening to and all the others ?
What she learned at that mosque prevented her from going to join ISIS .
And you have the market revolution of the 1980s and the huge increase of inequality in societies .
You can view yourselves from the outside .
And I didn &apos;t understand . He said , &quot; &quot; You have a great style .
And all of this had been hidden to me , before I had tried to understand it .
And when I asked one of the women about the shock and awe response , she said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry , same thing back home .
We have these maquettes scanned into the computer at very high resolution — enormous polygonal count .
And that &apos;s actually a completely computer-generated rendering of her face .
But how are we going to know who they are when we &apos;ve been told to avoid and be afraid of them ?
We went to Brazil . We went to China and to India , to Bentonville , Arkansas , to Washington , D.C. and to Sacramento .
It &apos;s a very old literature by now , it &apos;s coming up on 50 years .
Let &apos;s look at a specific video so you can see how it works .
This is why wars get fought .
Okay , I &apos;m going to show you again something about our diets .
It reminds us that we are a part of nature and we need to take care of it .
This lets you do it .
Similarly , just through the grip of the cane , you can feel contrasting textures in the floor below , and over time you build a pattern of where you are and where you &apos;re headed .
But here he stands as testament to the fact that you can &apos;t roughhouse on the playground today .
Your skin cell is really useless without a heart cell , muscle cell , a brain cell and so on .
People are saying that it &apos;s moving from the idea of the dream home to the dream neighborhood .
Its origins are firmly rooted in the analog age .
To love everybody , he sometimes did not see the very closest ones , and that is inevitable for men of his stature .
A vegetable , having the intelligence of a three-month-old baby .
And I just want to give you the highlights of the bystander approach , because it &apos;s a big thematic shift , although there &apos;s lots of particulars , but the heart of it is , instead of seeing men as perpetrators and women as victims , or women as perpetrators , men as victims , or any combination in there .
This is a shift change , one of three .
They said , &quot; &quot; Go and do it , and we &apos;ll come and lecture . &quot; &quot; And I knew it would be amazing fun to bring brilliant students from these countries — where they don &apos;t have any opportunities — together with the best lecturers in the world — who I knew would come , because of the interest in Africa — and put them together and just let the sparks fly .
And it &apos;s not just Linux , it &apos;s this thing called Git , which is this management system for software development .
So what , though , is driving that change ?
The eulogy virtues are the ones that get mentioned in the eulogy , which are deeper : who are you , in your depth , what is the nature of your relationships , are you bold , loving , dependable , consistency ?
I think anybody who lives in an urban environment encounters graffiti all the time , and there &apos;s all different sorts of it .
At the 15-hour mark , I started to get a better picture of what was there , but I had a creeping suspicion that what I was looking at was not at all related to what I was looking for .
( Music and singing &quot; &quot; Indey &quot; &quot; ) ( Music ends ) Or take , for example , the phrase for &quot; &quot; It is right &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; It is correct &quot; &quot; — &quot; Lickih nehu ... Lickih nehu . &quot;
So , one person could actually play and almost — this is pretty heavy — carry the hurdy-gurdy .
These are huckleberry bushes .
If you get a red cross , well , I &apos;ve looked carefully around the room and it &apos;s not going to make much difference to this crew .
So the question is , how do they deal with this material ?
And at the same time , the gorgeous work of Takeshi Ishiguro , who did these beautiful salt-and-pepper containers that are made of rice dough .
And the interaction is crucial .
Ghana felt safe to me as a child .
For us , the sun is the source of prosperity .
So I was excited , then I panicked , then I was excited , then I panicked , and in between the excitement and the panicking , I started to do my research , and my research primarily consisted of Googling how to give a great TED Talk .
this an unprocessed picture , by the way , I should say , it &apos;s black and white , straight from Saturnian orbit .
And they &apos;ve put it deep down in an iron mine in Minnesota , OK , deep under the ground , and in fact , in the last couple of days announced the most sensitive results so far .
He wanted to know what is just .
So that , I will not do .
They are so many and so varied that from this distance they appear like the stars from Earth .
This change has contributed to the vitality and the whole economy .
And they featured role models like Abraham Lincoln , who was praised for being modest and unassuming .
It was done in five months by a startup company of a couple of people .
So we were careful .
In countries where this really went forward — do you remember the English label , of the &quot; &quot; Plain English Campaign &quot; &quot; ? — this is all based on a consumers &apos; movement .
And that &apos;s why I believe that Netflix was so successful , because they used data and brains where they belong in the process .
And as a little girl , I loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us much more like a helpful , trusted sidekick — something that would delight us , enrich our lives and help us save a galaxy or two .
So we started to realize that we had a problem , and the problem is more serious because of this .
In fact , when they put it into the jawbone , it could integrate into the jaw , and we know now with very sophisticated imaging technologies that part of that integration comes from the fact that this material is designed in a very specific way , has a beautiful chemistry , has a beautiful architecture .
Things where , you know , a factor of 10 difference can make a factor of 1,000 difference in the outcome .
I was so moved by these results that I wanted to make these forests with the same acumen with which we make cars or write software or do any mainstream business , so I founded a company which is an end-to-end service provider to create these native natural forests .
If you look at the human brain compared to a chimpanzee brain , what you see is we have basically a very big chimpanzee brain .
So this is a huge challenge to the way we think creativity comes about .
But that &apos;s how robust this moral reframing effect was .
And the craft that I ’ m in — this hasn ’ t been shown before .
Next , we must disseminate what we learn .
So for me , this project shows kind of how far we can go from some of those sort of small things that I was working on at the beginning of my career .
It &apos;s the era of big business and data centers for computing .
So one of the disadvantages of these small robots is its size .
And you can see the massively parallel processing Nintendos there .
Today in Mexico we &apos;re asking for Gandhis .
The way we show the world is going to change the way we see this world , and we live in a moment where the mass media are doing a terrible , terrible job at representing the world : violence , extremists , only spectacular events , only simplifications of everyday life .
I mean , this is a 2005 Business Week cover .
That &apos;s why I have one last thing I want to show you .
But I want you to do is also , with your eyes , is follow the colored ball that I ask you to follow .
So , what I &apos;d like to do today is tell you a little bit about myself , because I &apos;d like to put in context what I &apos;m going to tell you .
So I try to create these very minimal activities that allow people to express themselves , and , hopefully — ( &quot; &quot; The End &quot; &quot; by The Doors ) Whoa ! I &apos;m like — on the page , but it doesn &apos;t exist .
It wasn &apos;t two years ago that everybody was talking about — we &apos;ve found the Holy Grail of biology .
( Applause ) Now , this doesn &apos;t mean that the job is done , obviously .
I &apos;d want him to be unselfish , and look for the pass first and not shoot all the time .
So these numbers are the numbers which denote the roughness of these surfaces .
For example , if I do that , and reach and grab an apple , a motor command neuron in the front of my brain will fire .
The fact is that it does not scale .
Aren &apos;t they ?
( Laughter ) At least , according to a 1973 &quot; &quot; Book of Lists &quot; &quot; survey which preceded all those online best , worst , funniest lists that you see today .
So I guess that &apos;s my brand .
They are open-minded in the face of ambiguity .
We made giant pillow-shaped balloons .
Yes , we do have all the resources that we need in order to develop new cultural institutions , but what I think is more important is that we are very fortunate to have visionary leaders who understand that this can &apos;t happen from outside , it has to come from within .
Wherever we deliver our services , farmers use these tools to climb out of poverty .
Stories make us fall in love .
Off the coast of California comes this : It &apos;s an abalone shell .
So I started a project called Life Edited at lifeedited.org to further this conversation and to find some great solutions in this area .
Usually , doxorubicin — let &apos;s call it &quot; &quot; dox &quot; &quot; — is the cancer drug that is the first line of treatment for breast cancer .
And they then become the comets as we see them in the sky .
And why , the root question , is so little being done to stop the wars , the persecution and the poverty that is driving so many people to the shores of Europe ?
Look for that kind of stuff .
The male of this species has a massive brain that he uses to hunt for cold beer .
This is my son Leo .
You place the cross into the ice , in the shadow of Ausangate , the most sacred of all Apus , or sacred mountains of the Inca .
Look , the highly infected are four percent of all population and they hold 50 percent of the HIV-infected .
Inequality is the other great challenge to achieving sustainable urbanization .
One is , you said weaken encryption . I didn &apos;t .
And then they turned on us .
( Laughter ) LS : I don &apos;t even have to talk , right ?
Which is not just to meet new people and extend your reach , extend your influence , but instead , find someone you don &apos;t know , and find someone else you don &apos;t know , and introduce them .
What happens is that the second this introduction of incentive gets us so that instead of asking , &quot; &quot; What is my responsibility ? &quot; &quot; all we ask is , &quot; &quot; What serves my interests ? &quot; &quot; When incentives don &apos;t work , when CEOs ignore the long-term health of their companies in pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to massive bonuses , the response is always the same .
And this is not an unlikely scenario because 90 percent of sexual assaults are committed by repeat offenders .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this has actually been a little bit startling to the game-development community . ( Laughter )
What troubles me is not that video game violence is becoming more and more like real life violence , but that real life violence is starting to look more and more like a video game .
That was in minutes — 20 minutes .
( Video ) Woman : &quot; &quot; I destroy lives , &quot; &quot; mum said .
A switch-hitter is a bisexual person , and we gay and lesbian folks play for the other team .
So I studied forestry .
And , as a psychologist , what excited me most was the idea that we would use what we learned in the virtual world about ourselves , about our identity , to live better lives in the real world .
The quality of care that children receive in their families can have a more significant effect on their well-being than from the actual experiences of war that they have been exposed to .
And so there &apos;s about seven or eight cities already in the U.S.
You know what his unsuccessful pickup line was ?
Take a look at these guys , they &apos;re growing in power , and by the way , this was done a while ago before the current economic crisis , and that &apos;s probably going to get steeper .
As this information started coming to people , we said things like , we don &apos;t want to see your expense report , we don &apos;t want to know how many holidays you &apos;re taking , we don &apos;t want to know where you work .
And again , the transition from one of the many thousands of sketches and computer images to the reality .
Because I was saving a minute out of my commute .
And I have a good example of that too , again from the history of science .
And so the global village is as big as a planet , and as small as a village post office .
Thank you .
Today , there are 14 health clinics in that area alone .
How does it really work ? It turns out there is a back room that is kind of windowless , metaphorically speaking .
Now for this , I needed a different craft : bigger , wider , faster , more powerful .
It &apos;s a very desolate place .
You &apos;ll noticed that almost all of them are minority .
That I &apos;m this uber-endurance guy ?
And those bumps act like a magnet for water .
And the children , we teach during six months how to separate their garbage .
So , it &apos;s sort of related , but you can see it &apos;s much more overtly erotic .
Jimmy Kimmel actually .
To the extent that you can equalize the amount of detail that people put into the mental representations of near and far future , people begin to make decisions about the two in the same way .
The contemporaries of William Beveridge , who was the architect of the first welfare state and the author of the Beveridge Report , had little faith in what they called the average sensual or emotional man .
We could do with much , much less — and I know , I &apos;ve been a vegetarian for a long time , and you can easily do without anything .
and everybody is talking to everyone else — it &apos;s not isolated points on a map anymore , it &apos;s a network we &apos;ve created .
So penguins really differ in their personalities just like our dogs and our cats .
And it &apos;s a remarkable map . It &apos;s in the National Archives here in Kew .
This is the difference between being effective — doing the right things — and being efficient — doing things well whether or not they &apos;re important .
The universe disappears .
So last summer , I attended a wedding in Southern England .
Think about war .
He was exhausted , and Rob was staying with him .
Developing world is a short life in a large family . &quot; &quot; And I like that definition , because it enabled me to transfer their mindset into the dataset .
Who doesn &apos;t want healthier children ?
Now , let me give you an example of how it works .
I &apos;m not sure what it &apos;s called .
The cyber world became accessible , and this technology that we created for the blind has many uses , way beyond what I imagined .
Well , how about science ?
I hated that walk , I hated that balcony , I hated that room , and I hated that house .
There &apos;s 9,000 of them here , and they &apos;re being built for most of the big cities , Beijing and Shanghai , Shenzhen .
There &apos;s been four billion years of organic , biological life .
And animals are thriving — and we probably came from here .
UE : Nope . It &apos;s just smoke .
And the low-power double bind means that we have a narrow range , and we lack power .
So there was a time when it was your first time ever hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work .
And so this would be the typical talk I would give .
Although they are like in different contexts , one is magical , the other two are like investigation , I like those books because they have something special in them .
And if we were to fall towards this black hole , we would see all of that light lensed around it , and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened .
Here are some tricks that I started to bring to that new terrain .
So let &apos;s look at how often the technology has to do the right thing .
Here , in a photo by Brian , a seemingly crucified shark is caught up in a gill net off of Baja .
One year turned to two , two turned to three .
And nobody calls Batman simple or stupid or skinny .
And they work .
and you believe that you can self-improve and educate yourself as you go along .
Now , these caves contain some of the oldest cave paintings in the world .
I can hear if someone points at me with a remote control .
These young boys are in Nepal .
Now , imagine , if you will , without getting too technical , I &apos;m making a little sine wave here in the air .
Now this encrypted data is sent through the server to Alice , and because the message was encrypted using Alice &apos;s public key , the only key that can now decrypt it is a private key that belongs to Alice , and it turns out Alice is the only person that actually has this key .
New drugs kept them healthy .
He hasn &apos;t RSVP &apos;d yet , but fingers crossed .
And what you have to think about is , when you &apos;re dancing in the flames , what &apos;s next ?
EZ : Well , if you are sure , I have to tell you that within five minutes I will talk very fast .
And of course , we used the loop of the building as a circulatory system , to thread everything together and to allow both visitors and staff to experience all these different functions in a great unity .
In fact , I scoured the headlines looking for the best headline in a newspaper I could .
Powering them is one of the greater engineering challenges that we had to deal with , because powering a cell phone under a tree canopy , any sort of solar power under a tree canopy , was an as-yet-unsolved problem , and that &apos;s this unique solar panel design that you see here , which in fact is built also from recycled byproducts of an industrial process .
Less than five percent .
I remembered being in that hut with that old lady and my mom holding me down .
The first one belongs to those ethnic societies who believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous , so they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with any centralized authority .
It &apos;s moving us towards an inflection point for gender equality .
What I &apos;m going to try and do is to give some pointers to what I think is the landscape on the other side of the crisis , what things we should be looking out for and how we can actually use the crisis .
Gray-yellow hair , army pants under a nightgown , her turning away , hiding her ravaged face in her hands , muttering an inappropriate &quot; &quot; Hi . &quot; &quot; Sometimes there are frightening goings-on in the stairwell .
Well we know that that was not a cheap war .
Comets are very much like asteroids .
Thank you .
You go to an elementary school at three in the afternoon and you watch the kids come out , and they &apos;re wearing these 80-pound backpacks .
And yet , I am growing nostalgic about my country of birth .
I loved this guy .
♫ We don &apos;t need no more trouble ♫ Get that idiot out !
It will make a difference if you were to discover that the person you &apos;re looking at with lust is actually a disguised version of your son or daughter , your mother or father .
Switch out the knob for a pulse module , which is here , and now you &apos;ve made a little blinker .
But this is one of those very rare moments when we have to choose whether we &apos;re just pedaling furiously to get back to where we were a year or two ago , and a very narrow idea of what the economy is for , or whether this is a moment to jump ahead , to reboot and to do some of the things we probably should have been doing anyway .
Which leads to the last topic : Do not forget to have fun .
You can sort of see the funky new condo buildings in between the office buildings and the public space and the new Main Street .
We also tag makos with our NOAA colleagues , blue sharks .
So it &apos;s about a mile across , 600 feet deep .
( Laughter ) Who folded that thing up there , and why ? ( Laughter )
And if you look , you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s only one way you can score three .
They said , &quot; &quot; Why are you doing this , Lincoln ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Look , these are the strongest and most able men in the country .
And so we decided , of course , to have Sim City 2000 , not the other Sim City , that one in particular , so the criteria that we developed along the way were really strong , and were not only criteria of selection .
And finally , a criminal justice system that believes in black young people , rather than treating black young people as the enemy to be rounded up . ( Applause )
Nothing could be further from the truth , and I hope today to show you why that is .
We do this , of course , with matters of race , and politics , and everything else , and we do it in science as well . So we look , just look — and scientists do it , constantly — we look for evidence that reinforces our models , and some folks are just all too able and willing to provide the evidence that reinforces the models .
For the past five years , I &apos;ve been taking my wife and kids to Southwestern Montana , where I worked as a teenager on the hay harvest . And Montana , at first sight , seems like the most pristine environment in the United States .
Now how about exponentially cheaper ?
And Aicha started , and she said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if my son is guilty or innocent , but I want to tell you how sorry I am for what happened to your families .
But I think this research shows that the British Enlightenment , or the Scottish Enlightenment , with David Hume , Adam Smith , actually had a better handle on who we are — that reason is often weak , our sentiments are strong , and our sentiments are often trustworthy .
This is BP &apos;s gas station in downtown Los Angeles .
How many Creationists do we have in the room ?
They mobilize the resources to create a solution , both within the clinical system , and then by bringing in people from public health , from other sectors , lawyers , whoever is willing to play ball , let &apos;s bring in to create a solution that makes sense , to take those patients who actually have clinical problems and address their root causes together by linking them to the resources you need .
Remarkable impact on mortality .
You will have your fair share of insults and ridicule and threats .
The green areas here show where corn yields , just showing corn as an example , are already really high , probably the maximum you could find on Earth today for that climate and soil , but the brown areas and yellow areas are places where we &apos;re only getting maybe 20 or 30 percent of the yield you should be able to get .
All of that is necessary , but we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome .
This is about a place in London called Kiteflyer &apos;s Hill where I used to go and spend hours going &quot; &quot; When is he coming back ? When is he coming back ? &quot; &quot; So this is another one dedicated to that guy ...

In this case it &apos;s Mies van der Rohe &apos;s Less is More .
And at the age of 17 , I moved to the United States , the world &apos;s greatest democracy .
If , however , I am right , whatever you do , don &apos;t keep it to yourself , OK ?
And these folks know something that we &apos;ve lost sight of .
( Laughter ) SW : She &apos;s a comedian . I suppose you think you &apos;re famous ? Are you famous ?
Dawn , very good .
It was the sorrow that &apos;s taken so long .
After 11 complete mission failures , we got our first images from space .
We are coming at extremely high speeds , and we are deploying them to slow us down . So we have to do all kinds of tests .
They all look very different . But this language allows us to say that they are representations of the same symmetrical abstract object , which we call 4-4-2 . Nothing to do with football , but because of the fact that there are two places where you can rotate by a quarter of a turn , and one by half a turn .
We love relationships — very complex . So we love this kind of stuff .
So ROV stands for Remote Operated Vehicle , which in our case means our little robot sends live video across that ultra-thin tether back to the computer topside .
Canada was just pipped to the post in terms of the number one fundraising campaign in the world .
Shukran ! ( Applause )
The other thing to use is your body .
For a time , we shared the stage with our distant cousins , Neanderthal , who clearly had some spark of awareness , but — whether it was the increase in the size of the brain , or the development of language , or some other evolutionary catalyst — we quickly left Neanderthal gasping for survival .
Without Iraq balancing Iran , Iran could now become a threat , some in Israel argued .
Sometimes it actually gets us onto a more productive path .
( Nature sounds ) Well , a year later I returned , and using the same protocols and recording under the same conditions , I recorded a number of examples of the same dawn choruses , and now this is what we &apos;ve got .
And then it &apos;s United States today , up here .
As you have been told , I &apos;m Bulgarian .
On the one hand , result .
Your bones regenerate every 10 years .
There &apos;s the centerfold from National Geographic magazine with one of her caregivers , and she roams the web and has hundreds of hours of Bina &apos;s mannerisms , personalities .
Tool use must have enhanced our survival , mating and so on .
We can turn things that might seem small and obscure and blow them up until they &apos;re like constellations of information about life .
I was asked to come to Tegucigalpa and talk again on January fourth and fifth .
As you can see the little tether , that it &apos;s also magnetically levitated .
Now it &apos;s very hard to see the Earth there , it &apos;s called the &quot; &quot; Pale Blue Dot &quot; &quot; picture , but Earth is suspended in that red shaft of light .
And the habitat destruction is unbelievable .
Now that begins with economic power , but that &apos;s the way it always begins .
We have embedded the drug into devices that look like this one .
Now , one of the nice characteristics of simple things is you know what it &apos;s going to do , in general .
It was totally irrational , but the amazing thing , the astounding thing , is that thousands of young Japanese-American men and women again went from behind those barbed-wire fences , put on the same uniform as that of our guards , leaving their families in imprisonment , to fight for this country .
In Ruby &apos;s world , you learn technology through play .
You may have been dissatisfied with this talk , but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff .
For the first time , we &apos;re tracking the promises that were made on clean transportation , and politicos know that they have to deliver it , but the tipping point will come when we form coalitions — citizens , companies , champions of public transportation — that will make electric mobility the new normal , especially in a developing country .
This red cup comes from Rwanda from a child named Fabian .
And she said , &quot; &quot; Well , personally , I still feel like I have to curtsey when I see the president of my university .
What we came up with was an idea to exploit an old fact , or a known fact , about social networks , which goes like this : Do you know that your friends have more friends than you do ?
Even the government learned of the earthquake from their own citizens , rather than from the Xinhua News Agency .
Then you have touch , which is about the speed of a USB key .
In 5,000 years , we &apos;ve gone backwards in getting around cities .
&quot; &quot; Andy , Andy , how are you doing ? &quot; &quot; she said , using the name of my older brother .
As I thought , that &apos;s most of you .
I am so excited to be here .
Then I realized , maybe that &apos;s a little bit lofty for now .
It also is much more dynamic , so that you can see that the same form opens and closes in a very dynamic way as you move across it , because it has this quality of vector in motion built into it .
And so the next step — the sixth step beyond &quot; &quot; universal compassion &quot; &quot; — is this thing where you &apos;re linked with the needs of others in a true way , and you have compassion for yourself also , and it isn &apos;t sentimental only . You might be in fear of something .
We now think there are likely to be only just over 20,000 genes in the human genome .
If I had been able to simply fly to Australia , it would have taken me less than 24 hours .
This is a girl in inner-city Boston who had just done a high-tech on-demand craft sale in the inner city community center .
I need that data in September .
For even in my own life , there are memories I have that are difficult to explain — happenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird , that it is difficult to imagine they were not the result of prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life .
I know when a storm is coming .
What I want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there but go to a kind of regional scale — not just in terms of the scale of the fields , but in terms of the entire food network .
I don &apos;t really remember what my first introduction to poverty was but I do remember the most jarring .
And so while planning is important , so is flexibility .
At 31 , he was not able to relate the kind of &#91; unclear &#93; research , which he was doing with the lives of the ordinary people .
So , I wanted to open his eyes up to how much symmetry is running through the Alhambra .
It &apos;s like this very fast , very efficient way to get people off the street .
From your beginnings in Africa , through each generation , may be passed on to you , in your creation . It &apos;s a secret urge , hiding deep in you .
It &apos;s only half the length of this one .
It reminds me of my college days .
Because what we did with these girls is to understand their potential .
Can never tell if it &apos;s on .
Because when you &apos;re seeing the Middle East , you see only the bad news .
Your ears can &apos;t hear that chord ; they can actually hear amazing things . Your ears can hear 10 octaves .
And then you need to add some more ports , and more .
So what happens when I switch on that light ?
And this is really where we were headed .
I wanted to come home .
Bao Yongxiu : &quot; &quot; My mother tells me to come home and get married , but if I marry now , before I have fully developed myself , I can only marry an ordinary worker , so I &apos;m not in a rush . &quot; &quot; Chen Ying : &quot; &quot; When I went home for the new year , everyone said I had changed . They asked me , what did you do that you have changed so much ?
And at that period it was — in a way , a number of things were happening .
When I meet her in her office in Herat , she enters surrounded by four large men with four huge guns .
If we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces out of hostile , inhospitable spaces here on Earth , perhaps we can meet the needs of both preserving our own environment and moving beyond it .
And I thought , surely , we do better than that .
It adds together the interference pattern from two raindrops that land near each other .
But I believe such people can change .
Which I &apos;m sure you wouldn &apos;t want .
It has 3D vision and surround sound for what you &apos;re seeing and hearing right now , but that &apos;s just the start of it .
As individuals or in groups , volunteers or military conflicts , there are hackers everywhere .
Okay , most of you .
Tell us what you want in a spaghetti sauce . &quot; &quot; And for all those years — 20 , 30 years — through all those focus group sessions , no one ever said they wanted extra-chunky .
This is on a Mercator projection .
Man : Aw , shit .
Love came to visit me , shy as a fawn .
( Laughter ) &quot; I feel confused and unsure of what the hell I want to do . &quot;
Yeah ! Yeah .

Stroop tests have been done with metaphor as well .
When I &apos;m on my deathbed , I &apos;m going to remember one story more than any other .
And let &apos;s cut the crap for a second .
So for instance , here is somebody using the tool .
But also have the body language communicate something to the person who is looking at it .
I dedicated the past two years to understanding how people achieve their dreams .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Or as short as I wanted , depending on who I was dating . ( Laughter )

There &apos;s only been two concepts tried — two by the U.S. and one by the Russians .
A few years ago , I spent months in Europe to see the major international art exhibitions that have the pulse of what is supposed to be going on in the art world .
So when I had my TED wish last year , I said , look , I &apos;m going to switch my concept .
So what a fetus is learning about in utero is not Mozart &apos;s &quot; &quot; Magic Flute &quot; &quot; but answers to questions much more critical to its survival .
I work with vibration .
So I think these are not technical difficulties .
This one has a little cave in his chest .
( Laughter ) What were we just talking about ? ( Laughter )
These C.O.s play a big factor in these young people &apos;s lives for x amount of time until a disposition is reached on their case .
In no other Latin American country are there more than a couple of thousand .
( Laughter ) I was never here . ( Laughter )
I bought a computer , and &#91; they &#93; told me it had millions of colors in it .
We just need a good idea , motivation and lots of chutzpah , and we could save millions of people that otherwise would not be saved .
What we look for in firemen , in climbers , in policemen , and what we should look for in intervention , is intelligent risk takers — not people who plunge blind off a cliff , not people who jump into a burning room , but who weigh their risks , weigh their responsibilities .
As you get further and further away from the pump , the deaths begin to grow less and less frequent .
So the question is , can we make it ?
And this is a comet , captured by Dr. Euan Mason .
And then new particles might show up in our data as bumps — slight deviations from what you expect , little clusters of data points that make a smooth line not so smooth .
Thank you .
But ... maybe not .
What they decided to do was they would first try and slow down this epidemic by rapidly building as many beds as possible in specialized treatment centers so that they could prevent the disease from spreading from those were infected .
But even though recent , this metaphor of the network , is really already adopting various shapes and forms , and it &apos;s almost becoming a growing visual taxonomy .
I &apos;m sticking in my arm , I &apos;m giving them a big juicy blood meal , I &apos;m shaking them off , and we follow them through time to see these mosquitos get very , very sick indeed , here shown in fast motion , and three hours later what we see at the bottom of the cage is dead mosquitos , very dead mosquitos , and I &apos;m going to say , ladies and gentlemen , we have swapped the cards with mosquitos .
Daniel Kahneman : Sure .
He said roughly what &apos;s been said before .
Then I started doing animatronics .
I invite your interest as well as your involvement in driving this vision to a point of practical reality .
So just a few miles from here at Children &apos;s National Medical Center , when patients come into the doctor &apos;s office , they &apos;re asked a few questions .
And then two weeks later , Iqbal Quadir can issue his electricity in Bangladesh bonds .
Did you know that Ireland got 3 billion dollars in aid ?
Who would do this ?
It is the largest ongoing humanitarian crisis in the world .
In fact , the natural world is organized hierarchically upwards , not downwards , but upwards , and we begin with a self-regulating , semi-autonomous unit called a cell .
The fact is , though , that even when we &apos;re alone , we &apos;re a profoundly social creature . We &apos;re not a solitary mind built out of properties that kept it alive in the world independent of other people . In fact , our minds depend on other people . They depend on other people , and they &apos;re expressed in other people , so the notion of who you are , you often don &apos;t know who you are until you see yourself in interaction with people that are close to you , people that are enemies of you , people that are agnostic to you .
He &apos;s been a collector all of his life , starting when he was four or five in the early 1960 &apos;s .
So even though I have a fear of heights , I recently strapped myself to another human being and stepped out of an airplane at 12,000 ft .
So its military budget is bound to be enormous .
This is Blue Gene , the fastest computer in the world .
This is a difficult , unstable binary .
It &apos;s open source .
It was so mystifying : we couldn &apos;t make out what we were seeing on Titan .
And I say that because we live in a society that &apos;s so obsessed with black death .
You see , only that way you can be able to understand him .
You see , here &apos;s Huck ; he &apos;s an illiterate kid ; he &apos;s had no schooling , but there &apos;s something in him .
A week later , they held the most well-attended and disciplined demonstration to date .
These are techniques that can be used to be — that can be applied in a wide range of problem solving .
As a result , everything is happening in crisis mode .
Now this is the neurological goldmine , if you like , because a known reward excites people , but what really gets them going is the uncertain reward , the reward pitched at the right level of uncertainty , that they didn &apos;t quite know whether they were going to get it or not .
( Laughter ) So , think of it this way .
So this is a microscopy , a video I shot , and it &apos;s about 100 times magnification , sped up about 20 times , and inside the slime mold , there is a rhythmic pulsing flow , a vein-like structure carrying cellular material , nutrients and chemical information through the cell , streaming first in one direction and then back in another .
When you walked into those rooms , they smelled really bad , and our data suggests that it had something to do with leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup from people the day before .
So I could present things to him while he &apos;s in the scanner .
We didn &apos;t grasp what was going on .
In Tanzania last week , we had the launch of the East African Organic Produce Standard .
As in , for instance , that little matter of virgins and paradise .
They started with Cinematch , and they &apos;ve tried a bunch of others — there &apos;s Dinosaur Planet ; there &apos;s Gravity .
So the Internet , which you can surf the web anywhere you are in the world ; GPS , where you can actually know where you are anywhere in the world ; the touchscreen display , which makes it also a really easy-to-use phone for anybody .
( Applause ) Because we want to create — we want to create the classroom of tomorrow .
Like this .
Well , that &apos;s the good news .
You &apos;re making unexpected connections .
( Laughter ) Like , what have I got to say about all this ?
This is very good because we could potentially move everything apart in the brain .
I had to wash my bed sheet after every period , even if it was not stained .
I will fulfill the wish .
I couldn &apos;t believe I was on the other side of the world .
The first thing they did was to recognize the specificity of political jurisdiction inscribed in that empty space .
He did a lot of this work in the &apos; 60s , and so a lot of this logic theory lay fallow as we went down the digital computer revolution , but it &apos;s now coming back .
and even if counterintuitive , it &apos;s good news .
Some of the ideas are strange .
And it &apos;s a responsibility that I don &apos;t take lightly .
So , what your letter means : I &apos;ve got to tell you , we are all in a party , and political officials are the pinatas .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to try to square a four-digit number this time .
And he had his arm outstretched like someone out of The Apprentice .
We need to increase the production . &quot; &quot; &quot; Excuse me ? &quot;
So I called back and I told her , &quot; &quot; Look , Amy , tell the TED guys I just won &apos;t show up .
Not necessarily .
What sounds like faith , soft faith , may actually be fact , because the surprising truth — I mean , there are no studies , but the truth seems to be that these women who returned to their homes and have lived on some of the most radioactive land on Earth for the last 27 years , have actually outlived their counterparts who accepted relocation , by some estimates up to 10 years .
And so this photograph shows a small boy next to a codfish .
Most people say women .
Listen , listen , listen . Now — what can we do with thunder ?
Now , the way we accomplish this is by sharing data between the vehicles .
Lone Twin had come to Minto and worked with the residents , and they had created these dances .
And that &apos;s kind of been a big lesson to me , that you can &apos;t act on any object .
So if you look at the character carefully , you see there are lots of body movements going on , none of which you have to animate like in the old days .
And I &apos;m rather proud to say that this was found just near London , and that 55 million years ago London was full of mangroves .
So you could go in , you could get your tummy-tuck .
We even have skyscrapers built for cars .
But I didn &apos;t start out obsessed with food .
But it &apos;s limited , because really to know if it &apos;s a healthy restaurant , you need to taste the food , you need to know what goes on in the kitchen , you need the product of all of those ingredients .
Now , the standard story is that computers descend from military technology , since many of the early computers were designed specifically to crack wartime codes or calculate rocket trajectories .
But so those are all parts of our bodies where we very directly interact with our environment , in a direct confrontation , if you like .
Then sort of take a leap and think about the universe forming .
In rare but striking instances , a single lie told by just one entity in this honeycomb can lead to real trouble .
And I was hooked again on the importance of what I did .
So , we ’ ll go with the first piece .
The women are very good about getting mammograms now .
America &apos;s favorite pie is ?
This talk is about being prepared for , and resilient to the changes that are coming and that will affect our homes and our collective home , the Earth .
And often , I &apos;ll hear people say , who maybe know that I did this film , and they say , &quot; &quot; Oh , you know , I &apos;m against the war , but I support the soldiers . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ve started to ask them , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s nice . What are you doing ?
Now , the question of course is , what happened here ?
For instance , in the last half-century , more girls were discriminated to death than all the people killed on all the battlefields in the 20th century .
A remarkable , remarkable testament to the power of evolution .
Or some people dance in clubs .
We have to demand this new kind of technology .
We have almost 14 million roots .
One thing that I &apos;ve left out of this narrative is the obvious thing , which is the focus of the rest of my little talk , and that is other people .
These are ongoing experiments .
This works with a laser sensor that &apos;s mounted on top of Rezero .
Of course , he &apos;d get really bored .
Did anybody stop inventing ? Not a person . Not a soul .
Before I started this TED process and climbed up on this stage , I had told literally a handful of people about it , because , like many a journalist , I am far more interested in learning about your stories than sharing much , if anything , about my own .
You gotta carry the bottle , you gotta carry the syringe .
Also , they operate at high temperatures , and the fuel is molten , so they can &apos;t melt down , but in the event that the reactor ever went out of tolerances , or you lost off-site power in the case of something like Fukushima , there &apos;s a dump tank .
And we &apos;ve got Cradle-to-Cradle Gold on this thing .
And here is a surprise .
After all , the long-playing record was developed in the early 1930s , and now we put talking books on CDs using the digital access system known as DAISY .
AG : Thank you so much for bringing me back to TED .
Now , I &apos;m going to move now from this kind of — the sublime in the traditional sense of the word , that is to say , awe-inspiring , terrifying — to the somewhat more mundane .
Many archaeologists have devoted their lives to unraveling the mysteries of the past under hot suns and Arctic winds and in dense rainforests .
We want to be able to see our predators , but we also want to feel that our flanks are covered .
&#91; Light in Slow Motion ... 10 Billion x Slow &#93; Now , the whole event — ( Applause ) Now remember , the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nanosecond — that &apos;s how much time it takes for light to travel .
You all know about multitasking . You all have been faulty of multitasking when you &apos;re driving and you pick up your cellphone . Bad idea . Very bad idea .
This was how mantis shrimps make these very fast strikes .
We stayed full-time students , but in between we traveled , performing and teaching nine-year-olds to MFA candidates , from California to Indiana to India to a public high school just up the street from campus .
Over the next few months , my small nonprofit organization of less than 20 people was joined by more than 350 other reporters from 25 language groups .
We were really paralyzed .
All of this happens in seconds .
The retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here .
Now , you should know that at that time , the textile industry in the South was notoriously segregated .
But what are we doing with it ?
Why ? Air quality was the reason they used natural gas and got away from diesel .
I &apos;m a product designer by trade .
And you can imagine being on an island hoping you &apos;re going to see penguins , and you &apos;re in the middle of an El Nino event and there are no penguins .
If you have content that others are uploading to YouTube , you should register in the Content ID system , and then you &apos;ll have the choice about how your content is used .
They want to figure out how things work , and they want to do it in groups , like this hackers club in Washington , D.C. , that uses our materials to offer community courses .
Now metaphor is ubiquitous , yet it &apos;s hidden .
Technology has come of age that &apos;s allowing us to see the Earth from space and go deep into the seas remotely .
We start with Sherman in a Chinese restaurant , who gets a fortune that he &apos;s about to get caught by a trawler , which he does .
So the way that works is if you take two very , very fine patterns and you move them across each other , you will see a gross pattern that a microscope can see that otherwise you would not be able to see .
We felt that they were out of date .
And I woke up one day and I said , &quot; I don &apos;t need Prozac anymore . &quot;
If I turn it off , we see it drops .
Mechanical engineers design air handling units to make sure that people are comfortable , that the air flow and temperature is just right .
But every once in a while , like Lizzie Borden , like three times a century , and we &apos;re kind of due .
And so one of the tools that we can use to sample the oceans is acoustics , or sound waves .
My estimation is that probably 45 of you are absolutely passionate about classical music .
And that is that some of the most important learning we ever do happens before we &apos;re born , while we &apos;re still in the womb .
In the end , the grass is often greener on my side of the fence , although we don &apos;t realize it .
We &apos;re bees . We busted out of the hive during the Enlightenment .
So I know at TED you &apos;re supposed to have a change-the-world kind of thing .
And they were able to change therapies , including disabling the device — and this is with a real , commercial , off-the-shelf device — simply by performing reverse engineering and sending wireless signals to it .
Christmas morning , where we open up our gifts , where we have special prayers , and where we get to the old upright piano and we would sing carols . It was a very intimate moment .
So even if the tumor is not right on the surface , you &apos;ll still be able to see it .
We push that material to extruders where we melt it , push it through small die holes , make spaghetti-like plastic strands .
The outstanding — the salient problem about this for us is that these are places that are not worth caring about .
What you really want is not a sequential , not parallel development .
What if from the women in Africa who cannot sell any food — there &apos;s no roads , there &apos;s no warehouses , there &apos;s not even a tarp to pick the food up with — what if we give the enabling environment for them to provide the food to feed the hungry children elsewhere ?
This collagen is the stuff between cells .
How do you get them mobilized around the world if you &apos;ve shut all the airports down ?
If I can find this , I can &apos;t make the phone explode .
We have no such anchors and benchmarks for decisions in messy human affairs .
As citizens , I &apos;m asking you not to leave any child behind .
Here , I &apos;ll show it to you .
And on the 3rd of July 2013 , the army ousted Egypt &apos;s first democratically elected president , after three days of popular protest that demanded his resignation .

But more significantly , they gave me the ability to believe , totally , to believe that I could .
We are now replicating this in a 1.75-million-square-feet building , which will have 60,000 indoor plants .
All of this integrated into the same medical adhesives that are used in the hospital .
If you &apos;re under 50 we want you to work four more years .
Those 20 dollars might have been a quick lunch .
It &apos;s that the same plant has got leaves that are different shapes and sizes .

I was a young driver out on the highway , and the car in front of me , I saw the brake lights go on .
And we probably need , well , we probably need a cowboy to be quite honest .
And I think understanding that could revolutionize tax policy .
The only reason these things have any value is because we &apos;ve all decided they should .
And this surgery came along and basically made me who I am today and saved my life .
So what do such savings mean for the electricity that is three-fifths used in motors ?
In fact , on that other side is the area , Tora Bora , the area where Osama bin Laden &apos;s supposed to be . This is the tribal area .
You look at them in September , they &apos;ve gone down .
When I was four years old , I have a vivid memory of finding two pinpoint scars on my ankle and asking my dad what they were .
Try to get DSL installed in your house .
It &apos;s the moment where all the pieces come together , and suddenly the world comes to life as if it &apos;s an actual place that exists .
It &apos;s directly embedded ; there &apos;s no external instructions .
When my own daughter was born a couple of years ago by emergency C-section , we took matters into our own hands and made sure she was coated with those vaginal microbes that she would have gotten naturally .
Just 3 years ago , both the U.S. and France were saying they were investing militarily in cyberspace , strictly to defend their IT systems .
So , technology is selfish ; technology is generous .
This is a place , in a way , that I just would like you to , in a way , look at differently because of this event that has happened in it , a human event , and in general , it just asks us to look again at this world , so different from , in a way , the world that we have been sharing with each other , the technological world , to look again at the elemental world .
And I think total personalization in this new world will require total transparency .
My pals in the Crocodile Specialist Group of the IUCN , the &#91; Madras Crocodile Bank &#93; , an NGO , the World Wildlife Fund , the Wildlife Institute of India , State Forest Departments , and the Ministry of Environment , we all work together on stuff .
But potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology that can come from this project .
It wasn &apos;t a baseball player ; it was Linus Pauling .
And you &apos;re pretty rich by the standards of the world at large .
But then it warms up , and the tuna pops in , gets some fish , maybe comes back to home base , goes in again and then comes back to winter down there in North Carolina and then on to the Bahamas .
It &apos;s a conversation about augmentation .
We are a company that sells soap and soup .
Wouldn &apos;t it be interesting to take this way of thinking and arguing , engaging seriously with big moral questions , exploring cultural differences and connect through a live video hookup , students in Beijing and Mumbai and in Cambridge , Massachusetts and create a global classroom .
The four countries have no access to Facebook .
And so it turns out we &apos;re so stereotypical , our brains have got dedicated neural circuitry to decode this stereotyping .
They start flimsy and they get substantial as time goes by .
And that deeper , underlying point is that science is in the process of redefining life as we know it .
This is from the front .
This is in Montana , 2008 .
Probably the biggest change was understanding that the generational difference , the ages , had changed so much .
Now what does that mean ?
I did research and volunteered to help with fund-raising events , and whenever I could , I talked with those who had survived their own suicidal crisis or attempt .
And then you have TV Guide , a Fox property , which is about to sponsor the online video awards — but cancels it out of sympathy with traditional television , not appearing to gloat .
Events like post-ups , and pick-and-rolls , and isolations .
And for example , I don &apos;t really talk like that , but that was one of my people , and I &apos;m going to bring a few of my friends — I think of them as my friends — to this stage , in this spirit of the idea that the present is the new future , in sort of a meta way , because I thought about it , and the future , for me , what can be so frightening is that I don &apos;t know what &apos;s coming .
You &apos;ve got to figure out what they actually meant .
So for some reason , this was what I wanted to have a crack at , but I knew that even to stand a chance of getting home in one piece , let alone make it across to Canada , I had to take a radical approach .
I thought , this is somebody I &apos;ve got to get in this series .
What are we going to do about it ?
We all know the Earth is in trouble .
So we need to be thinking a little bit in those terms .
I want to start with this slide , because this slide sort of tells the story the way Science Magazine thinks of it .
One of the things that we &apos;re taught in high school is that all animals require oxygen in order to survive .
For some people it &apos;s only about what is in the immediate situation , what other people are doing and what you &apos;re feeling .
They &apos;re these special wheels that can move equally easily in all directions , and when you couple these robots with a video projector , you have these physical tools for interacting with digital information .
But that &apos;s what local governments across the country are doing to people who are poor .
Because of a scarcity of land , we are using the sacks to grow vegetables , and also &#91; we &apos;re &#93; able to save on the cost of living .
Things like Invisible Obama or the famous &quot; &quot; binders full of women &quot; &quot; that came up during the 2012 election cycle , or even the fan fiction universe of &quot; &quot; West Wing &quot; &quot; Twitter in which you have all of these accounts for every single one of the characters in &quot; &quot; The West Wing , &quot; &quot; including the bird that taps at Josh Lyman &apos;s window in one single episode . ( Laughter ) All of these are rapid iterations on a theme .
So as you go further away from the Sun , this becomes more and more powerful .
Even building codes actually limit the ability for us to build much taller than four stories in many places , and that &apos;s true here in the United States .
Go to the website . Look at the audit results .
Now — ( Laughter ) — I love that word , SuperRabbit .
There &apos;s a long list of innovations that we &apos;ve come up with there that are a little difficult to communicate in this talk , but — CA : Not least because you could still get copied , right ?
So the upshot was this .
And here comes the second term into play , what I call &quot; &quot; narrative hybrids &quot; &quot; — structures of multiple simultaneous stories that unfold throughout the buildings we create .
Designing it is one thing ; getting it built , we learned , is quite another .
We &apos;ve just started to scratch the surface of what you can do with this kind of imaging , because it gives us a new way to capture our surroundings with common , accessible technology .
It can take a randomly shuffled Rubik &apos;s Cube .
Let &apos;s do something a little more difficult .
( Sniffs ) ( Coughs ) Have a smell of that , mister cameraman .
Yeah .
Over time I &apos;ve collected about a half-dozen methods that do work — of course there are many more — that do work and that are effective .
And so we walked back up to the mountain two days later .
Engineer : Absolutely . Interviewer : You thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , bother . &quot; &quot; Engineer : I felt I was disappointed about it .
Where was Wislawa Szymborska during all this ?
In rural Uganda , Paul Bolton and his colleagues , using villagers , demonstrated that they could deliver interpersonal psychotherapy for depression and , using a randomized control design , showed that 90 percent of the people receiving this intervention recovered as compared to roughly 40 percent in the comparison villages .
She has achieved a modest prosperity that I believe is the human right of every hardworking person on the planet .
Her wish was to make a pilgrimage to Tibet .
They &apos;re responsible for about 7 million deaths per year , and there is no adequate vaccination method for any of those .
Put that in play .
Thank you .
Odds are pretty good that many of those things you wanted 10 years ago you now have .
Thousands of people around the country who could give his presentation for him , because he can &apos;t be in 100 or 200 or 500 cities in each night .
And then I can say , &quot; &quot; Well , just show me the stuff that affects heart health . &quot; &quot; So let &apos;s filter that out .
Now let &apos;s look at another part of the world , the former Soviet Republics of Central Asia , the &apos; stans .
So if you are concerned to influence energy policy , or you are concerned to influence national security policy , or health policy , or education , science — and a particular branch of science — is a way to do it , not the way we &apos;ve been doing it , which is seat-of-the-pants wisdom .
The lowest number of combatant casualties occurred in 2003 , with just 20,000 killed .
And the last operation was to think about the cell , the small cell of the project , like the apartment , as an essential part of the master plan .
RM : Before I moved to Chicago in 2005 , I didn &apos;t even know cities had their own flags .
It &apos;s called mass transit .
Today , the action takes place in a distant time and place , which gives the viewer a sense of detachment from what &apos;s happening , a sense of separation .
CA : So you picture , at some point , live , in real time , you could have this kind of conversation , inviting questions , but with people from China and India joining in ?
I &apos;ve talked for three minutes .
But , you know , we &apos;ve just come from this discussion of what a bird might be .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s impossible , of course , for your eyes to see themselves , but they seem to be trying .
I probably would have already taken my own life , as so many others have done .
And just as 30 years ago we couldn &apos;t conceive that we would have the power of a mainframe computer that took up a room this size in our purses and on our belts , that we &apos;re carrying around in our cell phone today , and suddenly , computing , that used to be an expert driven system , it was a personal system that we all owned as part of our daily lives — that shift from mainframe to personal computing is what we have to do for healthcare .
Our friends think we &apos;re mad .
And as you &apos;re thinking of the consequences of that , it &apos;s getting really hard to hide from this stuff , among other things , because it &apos;s not just the electronic tattoos , it &apos;s facial recognition that &apos;s getting really good .
It looks at the territory of the United States as if it were a wheat field that is procured by the winds and that is really giving you a pictorial image of what &apos;s going on with the winds in the United States .
We have no other option , so I &apos;m very curious to see what &apos;s going to happen .
If you want to change the world , it helps to have a good cross-section of society on your side .
Nearly no prisoner resisted without giving a testimony .
And that &apos;s sort of like this lone guy in the backyard , you know — &quot; &quot; I accidentally built a 747 . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to happen .
That people can read the transcripts is horrific enough , but a few weeks later , the audio tapes are aired on TV , and significant portions made available online .
But more importantly , it was linked in to the Andean notions of sacred geography .
Don &apos;t panic — don &apos;t panic now , I &apos;ll help you through this .
This coral is eight meters tall , right .
( Laughter ) But Africans were using this platform to take some kind of ownership of the tourism sectors .
There are literally hundreds of those kinds of communities across the Middle East , across the path .
Those were the imaginations that were going through my mind every day .
We do have the technology that &apos;s scaleable , and our network of global partners has been expanding and can be expanded at a rapid rate , so we &apos;re comfortable that this task can be accomplished .
And what do all these pictures and events have in common ?
I &apos;ll figure something out .
It saved me when I was in the middle of writing &quot; &quot; Eat , Pray , Love , &quot; &quot; and I fell into one of those sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster , the worst book ever written .
Like , I like my voice .
But when you look at that , you have to remember that this machine did not do any physical trials on how to move forward , nor did it have a model of itself .
These differences were highly significant .
Remember when we landed humans on the Moon ?
Because it &apos;s got all those A &apos;s lined up I guess .
Some can glide as flat as 60 feet forward for every foot of descent .
( Applause )
It &apos;s crap .
They want to be missed .
One seemingly small aspect of the overall relief effort became increasingly important as the delivery of food and water started rolling .
The body is something changeable — anyone may develop a disability at any point .
So that lesson was the lesson that &quot; &quot; Do not draw attention to yourself either in the home or outside of the home . &quot; &quot; Maybe it &apos;s a migrant lesson .
Ken Knowlton does wonderful composite images , like creating Jacques Cousteau out of seashells — un-retouched seashells , but just by rearranging them . He did Einstein out of dice because , after all , Einstein said , &quot; &quot; God does not play dice with the universe . &quot; &quot; Bert Herzog out of un-retouched keyboards . Will Shortz , crossword puzzle . John Cederquist does these wonderful trompe l &apos;oeil cabinets .
You &apos;ve heard it said before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today , that less is more .
And lo and behold , the hiccups went away .
No salt , no pepper , no oil , no spices .
Whoa !
And after we experimented with different flavors of cheese , I realized , well , this is a directed attack .
Netflix was right — the Netflix model could capitalize on the DVD in a way that the video-rental stores couldn &apos;t .
I want to tell you a little bit about this photograph .
I watched these films in wonder , transfixed , fireworks going off in my head , thinking , &quot; &quot; That is what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; The idea that all the math , science and code I had been learning could come together to create these worlds and characters and stories I connected with , was pure magic for me .
This graph shows that our bacteria really do have a genetic pathway to biodegrade phthalates .
Before making my own Mother &apos;s Day card , I thought I would take a look at the Scratch website .
Her eyes were extra bright and extra blue , as a result .
That was 70 years ago , and the way we gain informed consent , this tool that was created to protect us from harm , now creates silos . So the data that we collect for prostate cancer or for Alzheimer &apos;s trials goes into silos where it can only be used for prostate cancer or for Alzheimer &apos;s research .
When we slow it down 50 times we see how the leg is hitting that simulated debris .
In the 1930s , Roosevelt put thousands and thousands of Americans back to work by building bridges and infrastructure and tunnels , but he also did something interesting , which was to hire a few hundred writers to scour America to capture the stories of ordinary Americans .
( Laughter ) Some of the happiest days of my life have been spent ... ( Laughter )
That &apos;s a wire running down the middle , and not only is it a wire , if you take that piano circuit , you can thumbtack into the middle of a pencil , and you can lay out wire on the page , too , and get electrical current to run through it .
It &apos;s a secret . The animal effectively climbs by slipping and look — and doing , actually , terribly , with respect to grabbing on the surface .
I have a B.A. in English from Harvard College , an MBA in marketing from Wharton Business School .
I use the word &quot; &quot; want . &quot; &quot; Technology wants .
Blog about it , tweet about it , talk about it , and commit a hundred percent , because very , very few things are impossible to achieve if we really put our whole minds to it .
And in all of those countries , you can see , not more than four percent of injectors ever became infected with HIV .
A photo is a reminder of someone or something , a place , a relationship , a loved one .
For example , what do you see here ?
It &apos;s a deflationary force , if not handled right .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s all curled up .
Of those rats that don &apos;t abort , atrazine causes prostate disease in the pups so the sons are born with an old man &apos;s disease .
And lastly I &apos;ve realized , in experimenting with this device , that I also kind of have a nervous tic .
So there goes my theory of necrophilia .
The dendritic pattern you see mimics the growth of mushroom mycelia , which are the equivalent of plant roots .
So , I want to argue today that the fundamental source of Africa &apos;s inability to engage the rest of the world in a more productive relationship is because it has a poor institutional and policy framework .
So I took the approach that the chair should do as much for them as humanly possible or as mechanistically possible so that they didn &apos;t have to fuss with it .
Today it &apos;s less than 50 cents a day .
And then you think of how lovely beings are when they are happy , when they are satisfied .
Intensive agriculture is based on the use of chemical fertilizers .
They watch the tops of our heads moving below on Earth .
It is common for hominids to evolve .
We live in a world where GDP is the benchmark of success in a global economy .
As telecoms sector grew , housing and construction , and I could go on and on . And this is to illustrate to you that once you get the macro-economy straightened out , the opportunities in various other sectors are enormous .
On a continent where more than a handful of leaders have been in power longer than the majority of the populations has been alive , we are in desperate need of something new , something that works .
We are not creating enough decent manufacturing jobs for our youth , and trade among ourselves is low .
Mood modifiers have been used from time immemorial — caffeine , alcohol , nicotine , immune system enhancement , vision enhancement , anesthetics — we take that very much for granted , but just think about how great progress that is — like , having an operation before anesthetics was not fun .
Now , I don &apos;t know if one of the editors was a woman , but that can make the biggest difference .
( Laughter ) I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love .
I &apos;m going to show you the six vocal warm-up exercises that I do before every talk I ever do .
And the reason I &apos;m saying this is that you may have the idea this problem is relatively recent .
I don &apos;t know quite where this diktat comes from .
But what we found over the past few months is that this approach — that we &apos;re pretty much standard upon — is incredibly powerful .
We are not good at reasoning with uncertainty .
And how might that change their lives ?
And they wouldn &apos;t tell me .
She is always happy and eternally young .
This is some aluminum foil , right ? You use it in the kitchen .
And so I do like something which is pointed , not blunt , something which is focused on reality , something that has the power , through its leverage , to transform even a very small space .
So what will that tell us about the origin of life and the meaning of life ?
I &apos;m not a vegetarian — this is the old Nixon line , right ?
But here &apos;s the thing : that vision of abundance isn &apos;t compatible with a world that still relies on a 20th-century nuclear doctrine called &quot; &quot; mutually assured destruction . &quot; &quot; It has to be about building the foundations for the 22nd century .
( Laughter ) As I walk out of the house from my Wi-Fi hotspot into the cellular network on a call with my wife — look at the upper left . That &apos;s the Wi-Fi signal .
What drew me to skateboarding , the freedom , was now restored , where I could just create things , because that &apos;s where the joy was for me , always , was creating new stuff .
And so in my lab at Stanford , my students and I are asking , what should we be working on now ?
These neurons will fire when a person performs a specific action .
Except , of course , as you &apos;ve probably guessed , that it doesn &apos;t , because the whole thing is a complete myth .
And what I need to tell you is that on 100 acres he gets 40,000 pounds of beef ; 30,000 pounds of pork ; 25,000 dozen eggs ; 20,000 broilers ; 1,000 turkeys ; 1,000 rabbits — an immense amount of food .
You can come when you are in Curitiba and have a coffee there .
You get services , like Reddit and Wordpress are actually accepting Bitcoin as a payment currency now .
There were several other activities .
Because , again , I think , sort of , putting our money where our mouth is , here .
Wanting to do the right thing in the right way for the right reasons .
There are errors everywhere , errors in the document , it &apos;s the wrong name of the captain , some of the boats never actually took to sea .
This is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions .
The first one is that not all media are created equal .
Thank you .
And the physician will then take a regular MR scan .
These are the surfaces the monkey is using to manipulate the tool .
You have stop signals — we have up to eight stop signals .
There &apos;s no big room to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms .
So , I grew up in this neighborhood . When I was 15 years old , I went from being what I think was a strapping young athlete , over four months , slowly wasting away until I was basically a famine victim with an unquenchable thirst .
There &apos;s no question about it .
So these funerals are characterized by elaborate rituals that tie people in a system of reciprocal debt based on the amount of animals — pigs , chickens and , most importantly , water buffalo — that are sacrificed and distributed in the name of the deceased .
Below is what most swimmers will find enables them to do what I did , which is going from 21 strokes per 20-yard length to 11 strokes in two workouts with no coach , no video monitoring .
And as the number of people who are older , above retirement age and getting older , as they increase , there will be less people to take care of them .
( Laughter ) Empathy is old , but empathy , like everything else in life , comes on a sliding scale and has its elaboration .
But here instead are examples , you can already 3D-print textiles , which is very interesting .
Many were bulldozed under at the time of the accident , but a few are left like this , kind of silent vestiges to the tragedy .
It has parallel lines , which are sun rays .
Xiè xie .
Is London a great big whale ?
That was a very moving piece .
And so chapter one really begins today , with all of us , because within each of us is the power to equal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps .
In the middle of my Ph.D. , I was hopelessly stuck .
I just remember a feeling of surprise ; surprise at finding a street with no cars , as opposed to the nearby Mass . Ave. full of cars ; surprise at finding a street draped by leaves and surrounded by trees .
But it turns out that the logic of the support group is value neutral .
And we then call that schizophrenia .
For example , have you ever considered that there are listening positions , places you can listen from ?
In addition to which there &apos;s an enormous amount of back and forth , mentoring of one student by another , of all the students by the doctors , and the result is a generation — we hope — of doctors who do have time for the people they treat .
They have weekly study groups , where teachers get together and talk about what &apos;s working .
Many people , I think , on our planet right now despair , and they think we &apos;ve reached a point where we &apos;ve discovered most of the things .
Two gigawatts comes through the Chunnel .
&quot; &quot; Moneyball &quot; &quot; is about to come out , and it &apos;s all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team .
In some cases , it &apos;s recyclable .
We might endlessly feel guilty that we are not making the right choices , and that &apos;s why we didn &apos;t succeed .
It &apos;s definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge , but it &apos;s also pretty exhilarating , because it &apos;s beautiful up there , and you &apos;re looking out on a beautiful view .
Thank you .
I know famous musicians , I know actors and film stars and millionaires and novelists and top lawyers and television executives and magazine editors and national journalists and dustbinmen and hairdressers , all who were looked after children , fostered , adopted or orphaned , and many of them grow into their adult lives in fear of speaking of their background , as if it may somehow weaken their standing in the foreground , as if it were somehow Kryptonite , as if it were a time bomb strapped on the inside . Children in care , who &apos;ve had a life in care , deserve the right to own and live the memory of their own childhood .
Well , to love well and to work well , you need wisdom .
And it &apos;s not easy to change their minds .
But actually , I don &apos;t think it should be weird .
( Applause ) I used to be a professor teaching about this .
We need to educate the staff .
And there &apos;s several ways of doing this , but one of the most popular ones involves using antibodies .
You can buy his trailer , and you &apos;d probably get a really good deal because he wants to get out of town as soon as possible .
We realized that the most convenient way to highlight the presence of the probiotics , and hence , the presence of the tumors , was to get these bacteria to produce a signal that would be detectable in the urine , and so we specifically programmed these probiotics to make a molecule that would change the color of your urine to indicate the presence of cancer .
They even use the brand name he created for his jihad .
Whatever it was for you , I bet that , among other things , this gave you a little more freedom , a little more time .
So this video was made by a YouTube user called Tamez85 .
There &apos;s another one which suggests that 30 million hectares of land in Europe , an area the size of Poland , will be vacated by farmers between 2000 and 2030 .
You &apos;d like to see a colony on Mars .
Because in the balloon , like in life , we go very well in unforeseen directions .
That is because the human mind is a complex system with many parts , and some of them can inhibit others .
I &apos;m in the crucible right now .
Some women have those heart attacks , but a whole bunch of women have this kind of heart attack , where it erodes , doesn &apos;t completely fill with clot , symptoms are subtle , EKG findings are different — female-pattern .
As fascism took over Europe in the 1930s , an unlikely reaction came out of North America .
As appealing as it might sound , you cannot algorithmically data mine your way to the answer .
But it rarely happens in biology .
Of course , the first computer was built just after World War II to solve military problems , but things got really interesting just a couple of years later — 1949 with Whirlwind , built at MIT &apos;s Lincoln Lab . Jay Forrester was building this for the Navy , but you can &apos;t help but see that the creator of this machine had in mind a machine that might actually be a potential media star .
You see , there was a time when you weren &apos;t afraid of failure , when you were a great artist or a great dancer and you could sing , you were good at math , you could build things , you were an astronaut , an adventurer , Jacques Cousteau , you could jump higher , run faster , kick harder than anyone .
Even if everybody changed , it wouldn &apos;t solve the problem .
Today , cancer detection happens mainly when symptoms appear .
Humans have been drawn to honeybees since early recorded history , mostly to harvest their honey , which is an amazing natural sweetener .
I have several colleagues who worked in the development of these theories .
So what about our fear ?
And recently , I &apos;ve become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story .
I &apos;ve been watching , since I grew up , the expressions of truth and beauty in the arts and truth and beauty in the sciences .
Detroit has always been halfway into the future — the advertising half .
Now , this idea is extremely controversial , and it &apos;s easy to see why .
( Music ) So this is actually how you might separate bikes from cars with minimal cost .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) These ideas are very tentative , and that &apos;s in part because this needs to be an inclusive and shared project .
So bring it on , Walmart , with 100,000 different products , and Amazon , with 27 million books and Match.com with — what is it ? — 15 million date possibilities now .
We &apos;ve got laws that fundamentally treat creative works as property , plus massive rewards or settlements in infringement cases , plus huge legal fees to protect yourself in court , plus cognitive biases against perceived loss .
Thank you .
This is a pocket of futureless language speakers in Northern Europe .
We are in effect polluting our children .
WK : Yeah .
Its focus on innate racial differences in disease diverts attention and resources from the social determinants that cause appalling racial gaps in health : lack of access to high-quality medical care ; food deserts in poor neighborhoods ; exposure to environmental toxins ; high rates of incarceration ; and experiencing the stress of racial discrimination .
When I went to the training camp I say , &quot; &quot; I want to kill as many Muslims , and as many Arabs , as possible . &quot; &quot; The training wasn &apos;t easy , but that was the driving force , because I wanted to revenge for my family .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to win the South by Southwest Weblog award . &quot; &quot; And I won it — I reached all of these people , and I had tens of thousands of people reading about my life every day .
Multinationals are protecting human rights .
Lots of people find self-transcendence in nature .
And most importantly for this , it &apos;ll tell us why we have language .
Through generous support and partnership scientifically with Google.org and the Skoll Foundation , we were able to start the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative and begin work in four different sites in Africa and Asia .
But this idea , that our present and our future are mutually exclusive , that to fulfill our potential for doing we have to surrender our profound potential for being , that the number of transistors on a circuit can be doubled and doubled , but our capacity for compassion and humanity and serenity and love is somehow limited is a false and suffocating choice .
And then , if you &apos;re one of these unsporting characters , you shoot the animals and take them home .
And he spent all this time stuck in the hospital while he was having those procedures , as a result of which he now can walk .
A lot of very handsome and pretty people here , skinny , chubby , different races , cultures . We are all 99.9 % genetically equal .
However , honeybees are a minority .
The Khmer Rouge closes the doors to the outside world .
Let me ask you a few questions to see if this is a good choice . &quot; &quot; Then you sell a lot more .
you know I &apos;m bound ; ♫ ♫ I &apos;m bound to thank for it ♫ ♫ La li la li la la la ♫ ♫ La li la la li la li la la la ♫ ( Clapping ) ♫ La li la la la ♫ ♫ La li la la la la ♫ ♫ La li la li la la la ♫ ♫ La li la la li la li la la ♫ ♫ And you ♫ ♫ Now you &apos;ve been so kind and ... ♫ Curb the enthusiasm , just a little bit .
So each window is an image and is a world that I often revisit .
For the Hollywood people in the audience , this even explains why action movies have larger budgets than comedies : it &apos;s because action movies translate easier into other languages and other cultures , so the market for those movies is larger .
And that is , &quot; &quot; What type of world do we want to live in , and what decision are we going to make today to ensure that we all live in a sustainable world ? &quot; &quot; Ladies and gentlemen , thank you very , very much .
And it &apos;s not sustainable , and the huge logging camps in the forest are now demanding meat , so the Pygmy hunters in the Congo basin who &apos;ve lived there with their wonderful way of living for so many hundreds of years are now corrupted .
Teams kill their ideas as soon as the evidence is on the table because they &apos;re rewarded for it .
What do you think of when I say the word &quot; &quot; design &quot; &quot; ?
I realize this is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food .
And we found that 10 out of the 11 100,000-base pair pieces we synthesized were completely accurate and compatible with a life-forming sequence .
But we ’ re all disciplined by the understanding that the only people who are going to decide , you know , whether I ’ m right or somebody else is right , are the people in our community in the next generation , in 30 and 50 years .
So the human brain , coupled with the human heart , and we join hands around the world .
We go forward to 2007 , not only had the world &apos;s stock of data exploded , but there &apos;d been this massive substitution of digital for analog .
So I don &apos;t want to be patient . And the task I &apos;m giving to you is to not be patient . So I &apos;d like you to actually try , when you go home , to get your data .
And so what does that mean , that it &apos;s biodegradable and biocompatible ?
But when I finish it , I seem to like those IKEA pieces of furniture more than I like other ones .
And , very surprisingly , over half of them had , actually , something to do with design .
Well , how are we going to think about this ?
That poster is not folded .
But this one &apos;s kind of cool .
What will making myself invisible here cause people to think ?
Now , if she &apos;s a servant , there is no way she could afford a pair of pearl earrings .
One , I care that you spell it right .
Health services were provided .
If you present with a diseased wind pipe we &apos;d like to take cells from your windpipe .
I know that we &apos;re near the end of this conference , and some of you may be wondering why they have a speaker from the field of religion .
We intuit other people &apos;s feelings ; we know the meaning of their actions even before they happen .
Sputnik wasn &apos;t a technical loss , but it was a prestige loss .
Move out , because as you change your world , as you change your community , as we believe that we are impacting one girl , one family , one village , one country at a time .
It &apos;s not , and binging is never good .

And , as I &apos;ve been looking , over the last year , for models for how to do that , I &apos;ve been sort of looking across time , and I &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity .

They &apos;re three or five or eight thousand miles in length , and if the material science and the computational technology is incredibly complicated , the basic physical process is shockingly simple . Light goes in on one end of the ocean and comes out on the other , and it usually comes from a building called a landing station that &apos;s often tucked away inconspicuously in a little seaside neighborhood , and there are amplifiers that sit on the ocean floor that look kind of like bluefin tuna , and every 50 miles they amplify the signal , and since the rate of transmission

That &apos;s one of the deadliest diseases known to humans .
The climate has changed . I will show you : no more flooding , no more fires .
So as we get closer to the &apos; 80s , we start to reengage those symbols .
I hope you will think about getting involved with Special Olympics .
And no parents objected , because we were trying to save lives , and this was a lifesaver .
Now , the trouble with just sending a bomb out for this thing is that you don &apos;t have anything to push against in space , because there &apos;s no air .
And this is what things sounded like from inside , next to the bag of chips .
And I went through the same period of shame and recriminations and felt cleansed and went back to work , until it happened again and again and again .
Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Tom Rielly : So Max , by taking all these samples of , let &apos;s say , 10,000 people , you &apos;ll be able to tell who &apos;s healthy and who &apos;s not ?
And through her self-defense , she grabbed their Adam &apos;s apples , she punched them in the eyes and she got herself free and out of the car .
And the reason we &apos;ve let ourselves down is that we &apos;re not properly studying how religions handle art .
It turned out to be about life , and having life skills .
Again , numbers , words , laid out in ways that made sense .
Well this is a logarithmic graph .
And suddenly , your whole world opened up .
Can &apos;t see all the hands , but it looks like all of you , right ?
Occasionally in America , I hear people saying Sir Richard and think there &apos;s some Shakespearean play taking place .
Another suit . ( Audience : Diamonds . ) LG : Diamonds , perfect .
They bypassed Sweden five years ago , and they are labeled a developing country .
Scholars have tried to explain : Why is it blue ?
So what you need to do , to take the capability of your hand , and put it on the other side of that small incision , is you need to put a wrist on that instrument .
And that you can put these on a grid that &apos;s 1,000 columns long across the top and 1,000 rows down the other way .
( Laughter ) So I was hiding in the shed , like that .
I take them backwards here to their independence , when they were up here in the beginning of the 1960s .
What is the nature of accidents ?
And you see that it is injured .
And the thing that struck me the most , that broke my heart , was walking down the main street of Sarajevo , where my friend Aida saw the tank coming 20 years ago , and in that road were more than 12,000 red chairs , empty , and every single one of them symbolized a person who had died during the siege , just in Sarajevo , not in all of Bosnia , and it stretched from one end of the city to a large part of it , and the saddest for me were the tiny little chairs for the children .
Another beautifully designed new building ruined by the sound of a common wall light switch .
That &apos;s a great story ! It &apos;s totally adapted for that .
It can replace , or it can inhibit actually , signals .
Beautiful organizations keep asking questions .
Now , I went one step further and said , &quot; &quot; Why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers and just have a paper document ? Let &apos;s go online . &quot; &quot; And many people might need help in computation .
It looks like uberPOOL is working .
We all have an inner critic that kind of guards what we say , so people don &apos;t think that we &apos;re obscene or crazy or unoriginal , and science is full of the fear of appearing unoriginal .
Also , you can go double-click , drag , to highlight in one-word increments as you drag .
Can we play that one ?
Granted , Megaffic is not as sexy as self-driving cars , but it promises to take Nairobi drivers from point A to point B at least 20 percent faster .
It &apos;s certainly true for me .
Number four , a kinder world .
Thank you very much .

So these birds became the very icon of the Everglades — an indicator species of the overall health of the system .
I could see vividly , I suppose , being filmed out of the door of a helicopter , there was , kind of , rock music playing in the background , and I had a ski pole with a Union Jack , you know , flying in the wind .
Freddie Gray .
You know you have 46 chromosomes . If you &apos;re lucky , you &apos;ve got 23 from each parent . Sometimes you get an extra one or drop one out , but — so you can skip the grandparent and great-grandparent stage and go right to the great-great-grandparent . And you have 46 people and you give them a scanner , or whatever you need , and they look at their chromosomes and each of them says which one he likes best , or she — no reason to have just two sexes any more , even . So each child has 46 parents , and I suppose you could let each group of 46 parents have 15 children .
I felt like I was a vessel of the future of humanity .
Sometimes the true nature of reality beckons from just beyond the horizon .
A lot of people kind of balk at the obstacles .
And so when word came out that AIMS was opening , it spread very quickly via e-mail and our website .
( Laughter ) For modern Americans who are exposed to more options and more ads associated with options than anyone else in the world , choice is just as much about who they are as it is about what the product is .
We build a big screen , we fly it in space , we put it up in front of the star , we block out most of the light , we fly a space telescope in that shadow that &apos;s created , and boom , we get to see planets .
Well , the &quot; &quot; so what ? &quot; &quot; comes when start thinking about the same problem set up just a little bit differently .
The U.S. is currently ahead in military robotics right now , but we know that in technology there &apos;s no such thing as a permanent first move or advantage .
The best part is obviously seeing the magical moments of humanity as time changed — from day into night .
Helen Keller said that the only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision .
And Doaa was terrified of the water .
Don &apos;t overdo the Botox ; nobody will think you &apos;re honest .
And the conversation I had with Dean Kamen this morning , one of the great DIY innovators , I &apos;d like to share with you — he gave me permission to do so — his technology called Slingshot that many of you may have heard of , it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator .
That &apos;s 10 inches .
Everyone knows , &quot; &quot; they say .
Do you look me up and down , wondering how hot I must get or if my husband has forced me to wear this outfit ?
We have to go in with protective suits and breathing gear , and 30 parts per million of H2S will kill you .
Cancer ? Heart attacks ? Diabetes ?
I have 18 out of the 19 signs of attention deficit disorder diagnosed .
He began to come twice a week to my center because women could not go to the mosque .
I &apos;m like , screw that . They &apos;re all in the pond and nobody &apos;s going into the pond .
It &apos;s amazing that 413 lbs were lost just from the extra exercise .
After the Algerian war , at the heart of the international resistance movements , his name circulated and the whole world came knocking at his door .
And I &apos;ll just play you part of a mockup of it , but you get a sense of what it &apos;s like to actually enter into that moment in time and be transported back in history .
All that energy was pumped into the fabric of space and time itself , making the Universe explode in gravitational waves .
He is interested in how we see as an animal , how we are interested in mimicry and camouflage .
And this is what I call behavior-changing products : products , systems or services that intervene and solve these problems up front .
After I left Bimini , I actually learned that this habitat was being bulldozed to create a new golf course and resort .
He sent us to one of the best schools in the city and gave us the best education .
So you can &apos;t trust those TED folks .
One of them you heard about : dark matter , dark energy .
And of course they have more influence , sometimes , about how they &apos;re seen .
That &apos;s kind of an invitation to pick up this name of those numbers coming out there and to just drop it into the script here , and now I can steer the car with the steering wheel .
And for some reason that day , instead , I asked myself a question , and it was , where does this stuff go ?
So then , I ask , what &apos;s in it for you ?
Anyway , the second thing I want to say about dying in the 21st century , apart from it &apos;s going to happen to everybody , is it &apos;s shaping up to be a bit of a train wreck for most of us , unless we do something to try and reclaim this process from the rather inexorable trajectory that it &apos;s currently on .
DR : I think there &apos;s a real opportunity to engage in a discussion of why we live in cities .
( Laughter ) So I made series of images , cuttings , and I assembled them in portfolios .
So what you see in the picture there is a cell with a hormone receptor in red punching through the edge of the cell .
The problem is , how many people should there be ?
Writing the oldest book in the world was Job , and he said , &quot; Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward . &quot;
In another decade , Joe will be released from Wormwood Scrubs .
You &apos;re told to do it and there &apos;s competition . How can it be fun ?
He managed to make the word tender .
You gotta be accurate ! There &apos;s measurement involved , increments .
At that time , there was only one bank that had ATMs in Kenya , and we could not get cash . The family couldn &apos;t get cash for him to start the treatment until Monday .
and yet here we are today , about half of the rainforest remains , and we have potentially more urgent problems like climate change .
Now , one of the problems with looking at blood pressure is your body does everything it can to keep your blood pressure at the same place .
Instead of reaching out to the common or the collective wisdom in our societies , investing in it to find more creative solutions , we reverted to political posturing .
First one : &#91; &quot; &quot; Japanese farming has no youth , no water , no land and no future . &quot; &quot; &#93; That &apos;s what I landed to the day that I went to Minamisanriku , one stop south of Fukushima , after the disaster .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s true .
So here , we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game .
Normally , acquiring moral behavior is simply part of growing up , like learning to speak .
This is not accurate , but it did happen to Tony Blair at the Davos Forum in 2005 , when his doodles were , of course , &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; and he was labeled the following things .
His livelihood is predetermined by the conditions of grinding poverty .
It &apos;s one of the mysteries we still have , super flares .
Now the list is done : a hundred years .
The focus was around the patient .
Let &apos;s pull this apart : I &apos;ll go ahead and explode it .
One of our philosophies in the book is that no dish is really intrinsically any better than any other dish .
And it &apos;s a new cumulative pressure on leaders .
We &apos;re going to discover an ancient shipwreck , a Phoenician off Brazil , or a new rock formation , a new life .
So last night , we heard about wishes .
They &apos;re drinking tea , they &apos;re having sandwiches .
Then somebody came in , slid their hand under and water came out , and we thought , is this what we &apos;re in for ?
By that statement , their vision should be really bad , right ?
With computer vision , I can estimate where the cars around me are , sort of , and where they &apos;re going .
That &apos;s what you see with these cameras .
The second half was just one big nap , pretty much , in class .
Brenda Laurel : I want to show you , real quickly , just a minute of &quot; &quot; Rockett &apos;s Tricky Decision , &quot; &quot; which went gold two days ago .
But , you know , it doesn &apos;t matter if I &apos;m actually good at it . What matters is that my hands know how to do it .
We use the contract to raise money from socially motivated investors .
You will give your genome to the pharmacist , and your drug will be made for you and it will work much better than the ones that were — you won &apos;t have side effects .
Hey , off the bed !
Still under foreign domination , and without sovereignty , India and China are down in the corner .
Through my work , I &apos;ve been trying to find ways to harness and unveil this .
The control of a laser is so precise that you can perform surgery inside of an eye , you can use it to store massive amounts of data , and you can use it for this beautiful experiment that my friend was struggling to explain .
They must think this guy with this dove , he must have spent years working with him .
Now anonymous companies are great for sanctions busting too .
This lady is Ellen van der Zweep . She &apos;s one of the best dog-trainers in the world , and she believes that we can do a lot more .
And what you &apos;re typing are recordings of your eyes as you &apos;re looking at other peoples &apos; eyes .
And , you know , I was already bargaining , as a five year-old child , with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercises , unsuccessfully , of course .
We &apos;re just going to click on Naturejobs.uk.
I humbly call this development .
In particular check out Asia .
Why are we talking about microalgae ?
So how does it work ?
It &apos;s already immersed in social networks .
Why comedy ?
NT : Here are the current students at AIMS . There are 53 of them from 20 different countries , including 20 women .
Translucence is glamorous — that &apos;s why all these people wear pearls .
( Laughter ) Now , after thinking about this a little bit we thought , you know , it probably would be simpler to do this with a nonlethal laser .
And that &apos;s why I lump growing lethality of hatred and death spiral of negativity under the general rubric , reasons to be cheerful .
They like to have a lot of eye contact , or mutual gaze .
Now imagine what you could place in your hands : an apple , maybe your wallet .
And I rebuild them and give them new life .
What I find fascinating is that we &apos;ve actually wired our world to share , whether that &apos;s our neighborhood , our school , our office , or our Facebook network , and that &apos;s creating an economy of &quot; &quot; what &apos;s mine is yours . &quot; &quot; From the mighty eBay , the grandfather of exchange marketplaces , to car-sharing companies such as GoGet , where you pay a monthly fee to rent cars by the hour , to social lending platforms such as Zopa , that will take anyone in this audience with 100 dollars to lend , and match them with a borrower anywhere in the world , we &apos;re sharing and collaborating again in ways that I believe
And we hear all the time from our community of civic hackers at Code for America that they didn &apos;t understand how much nontechnical work actually went into civic hacking projects .
He had three women helping him take care of these kids .
( Video ) Thumper : Come on . It &apos;s all right .
He had an intuitive understanding of the mythic structure of India .
But of course , it &apos;s not about that .
So I think what we &apos;ve learned is that the risks from this money creation scheme are quite modest , but the benefits are potentially huge .
Creating a big picture out of all the important little details that make up who we are .
And so it all brings us to one big question ...
That &apos;s what I want to do to change , to make a difference in the world .
( Laughter ) But no , in our mind up there are a host of things going on that we don &apos;t always know how to bring to the person that we love , because we think love comes with selflessness and in fact desire comes with a certain amount of selfishness in the best sense of the word : the ability to stay connected to one &apos;s self in the presence of another .
I was on the phone with my mom in September of 2010 , and we were talking about the news of a young college freshman from Rutgers University named Tyler Clementi .
If you see , if you hear , if you feel , if you &apos;re aware of anything , you are conscious , and they are conscious .
Okay , how big was that ? It &apos;s hard to get it .
These leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like Budrus .
And we &apos;ve also managed to communicate with people all over the world , from extraordinary places .
Even a photon has some degree of consciousness .
And so this is the important point that I like to study : that things are beautiful , that it &apos;s still a human connection — it &apos;s just done in a different way .
This is Linus Torvalds .
( Laughter ) Men , if you get nothing else out of this talk , practice expansive listening , and you can transform your relationships .
And you can imagine , and the thing about it is , that they believed that the human mind could handle this number of images because the important thing was to get the gestalt of what the images were about .
And the gut is a silent voice — it &apos;s going more for feelings .
And then , the systemic risks .
Well , imagine if you did the same task with friends while you were drinking in a pub .
Anyway , you get the idea .
In fact , QQ.com , which is a popular Chinese website , had 35,000 comments on this issue within hours .
Back in 1989 , when the Berlin Wall fell , an urban planner in London got a phone call from a colleague in Moscow saying , basically , &quot; &quot; Hi , this is Vladimir . I &apos;d like to know , who &apos;s in charge of London &apos;s bread supply ? &quot; &quot; And the urban planner in London goes , &quot; &quot; What do you mean , who &apos;s in charge of London &apos;s — I mean , no one is in charge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , but surely someone must be in charge .
And to that end , in November of last year , the New York Times and Vrse made a VR project called &quot; &quot; The Displaced . &quot; &quot; It launched with one million Google Cardboards sent out to every Sunday subscriber with their newspaper .
And then left it to a contractor to install these 79-cent switches behind them .
And in the northern part of the main island , this is ground zero for world longevity .
So you look around , where you &apos;re going to land , you try to make yourself ready .
It &apos;s actually part of a very long story , a great story , that began billions of years ago .
So , I was able to launch a three-year project with Caritas Germany , and we trained 30 Afghan women and men , and we opened 15 counseling centers in Kabul .
First you need access to land .
And then , of course , NASA also had a big announcement , and President Clinton gave a press conference , about this amazing discovery of life in a Martian meteorite .
How do I put that simply ? No .
So what will you do ? I &apos;ll tell you what I did and why I did it . And I know my time &apos;s up .
It was a Tuesday .
I am wondering what &apos;s your take on the cut by 70 percent for 2070 .
And so some of the things that we &apos;re thinking of , and many other people in the field are thinking of , are actually developing materials for that .
And those are the specific genes that differ from one to the other .
The deal is , any time you &apos;re in a Wi-Fi hotspot , all your calls are free .
And they &apos;re actually immune to lots of evidence .
Many male journalists in my society , they want to cover a story about drug addiction in my country .
Everybody was grabbing something .
We all split up into many groups as we argued over what to do next .
&quot; &quot; Is dating boring , now that humans reproduce asexually ? &quot; &quot; Who do we got ?
What exactly to the people watching this do every day ?
So , the flow of resources from the commodity booms to the bottom billion are without precedent .
So just with these three dinosaurs , as a scientist , we can easily hypothesize that it is just a growth series of the same animal .
And especially as suburbia is becoming less centered on the family , the family households , there &apos;s a real hunger for more third places .
And if you get out and walk around to the other side of the car , you see a life-sized light box of the car showing you how it works .
So really having computing work and understand you and understand that information , we really haven &apos;t done that yet .
Here in New York , the Department of Sanitation cleans up after us , to the tune of 11,000 tons of garbage and 2,000 tons of recyclables every day .
So those are not her pearl earrings . Whose are they ?
We get jealous , not because we &apos;re evil , but because we have little artists pent up inside us .
Each frame of the movie has information about itself .
Well , an excavation was begun immediately , and more and more little bits of skull started to be extracted from the sediment .
So what Studio H might offer her is a way to develop skills so that she might give back in the most meaningful way .
When this happened , a part of me thought , well , what &apos;s the big deal ?
What &apos;s the kind of environmental — what is the space of creativity ?
The real challenge is up to you : to take this tool and figure out how we can use it all across America and around the world , so that instead of recording thousands of StoryCorps interviews a year , we could potentially record tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands or maybe even more .
You can see , actually that &apos;s a fluoroscopy .
Well , the lessons aren &apos;t about wealth or fame or working harder and harder .
It was a terrible time .
Those of us who believe in heaven have some sort of idea of what heaven would be .
Perspective , that kind of alchemy we humans get to play with , turning anguish into a flower .
I grew up in the middle of nowhere on a dirt road in rural Arkansas , an hour from the nearest movie theater .
It &apos;s very difficult for a politician , because you &apos;re afraid that many lives have been lost in vain .
We believe that the blast was right outside the gate of Taji , we &apos;re heading to that location now .
Even in the times of H1N1 , I like the word .
And if it can do that , maybe it can also change your behavior .
Riccardo Muti , please .
The water &apos;s stiff .
Actually , I work for you . You pay my salary .
I know this makes you embarrassed .
So they might curb traffic , or put in a park bench , or some green space .
Yeah , so a couple of years ago I was turning 60 , and I don &apos;t like being 60 .
Now , at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning when you &apos;re all alone , haven &apos;t had much sleep , that was a very romantic idea , but it was that idea — the fact that you could in fact prove that there &apos;s somebody out there just using this same technology — that appealed to me so much that 20 years later I took a job at the SETI Institute . Now , I have to say that my memory is notoriously porous , and I &apos;ve often wondered whether there was any truth in this story , or I was just , you know , misremembering something , but I recently just blew up this old negative of mine ,
( Laughter ) Additionally , I &apos;ve heard horror stories from people whose teachers scolded them , of course , for doodling in classrooms .
I mean , let &apos;s just put it out there , face the fact that women are — in a time when we have more open doors , and more opportunities — are still not getting to the leadership positions .
It lives throughout the tropics , the Americas , Africa , Asia , Australia , into the Pacific .
So I think that &apos;s another big point .
So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time , that chunk of metal can be in two different places , then why not you ?
And I think in our family we were very lucky , because we learned about design backwards .
( Applause )
And we &apos;re doing the same thing we did for — more or less , that we &apos;ve done since the Civil War , a stick and a hook .
Well if you think it &apos;s going to last 18 months , are you going to buy 18 months worth of masks for every single person in your family ?
We then go on to the first thing that was very surprising .
I play squash and ice hockey , two very fast sports , and I wouldn &apos;t give them up for the world .
And then she got to Heathrow , and she had a little time to spare before her final leg , so she thought up another funny little acerbic joke : &#91; Going to Africa . Hope I don &apos;t get AIDS . Just kidding . I &apos;m white ! &#93; And she chuckled to herself , pressed send , got on the plane , got no replies , turned off her phone , fell asleep , woke up 11 hours later , turned on her phone while the plane was taxiing on the runway , and straightaway there was a message from somebody that she hadn &apos;t spoken to since high school , that said , &quot; &quot; I am so sorry to see what &apos;s happening to you . &quot; &quot;
We can make a difference , and make a difference , not just for women , but for a global economy that desperately needs their contributions .
And he would say , &quot; &quot; Ruby , what are you saying ? &quot; &quot; And she &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not talking . &quot; &quot; And finally he said , &quot; &quot; Ruby , I see that you &apos;re talking .
So vehicle fitness opens a new automotive competitive strategy that can double the oil savings over the next 40 years , but then also make electrification affordable , and that displaces the rest of the oil .
( Laughter ) Around Christmas , in my home in Tennessee , a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled .
Everybody &apos;s got an opinion .
Belshazzar , the son of Nebuchadnezzar , Nebuchadnezzar who &apos;d conquered Israel , sacked Jerusalem and captured the people and taken the Jews back to Babylon .
Now , in Ethiopia , we &apos;re in the process of designing the first organized Ethiopia Commodity Exchange .
He &apos;d had cataract surgery .
Her story has a positive ending , but there are thousands of others in similar situations who are much less fortunate .
We were , like , 10 , I think .
Usually , you &apos;re not scared .
Most importantly , what we &apos;re learning is that Nature has provided us a spectacular toolbox .
And it &apos;s clearly in the area of finance .
You see , hummingbirds are not hypersonic , but they are maneuverable .
The freshness , the capacity . I can turn this image .
My spirituality , my faith , being a hillbilly — I can say that , you can &apos;t — all of it is fair game .
( Applause )
KT : Look at the road — ( Beep ) Still got that goddamn blindfold on .
But there are a lot of similarities .
And of course that &apos;s a highly competitive space .
It &apos;s not a matter of calculation .
And we had about 10.2 million plastic surgeries in the United States , except that with the technologies that are coming online today , today &apos;s corrections , deletions , augmentations and enhancements are going to seem like child &apos;s play .
So sort of an interesting strange fact to find a visual structure right in the middle of their spring .
What &apos;s the recipe for a certain cocktail ?
It &apos;s a promise .
So they can actually inflate it and deflate it according to their emotions .
And so on and so forth . What does this piece require ?
You know , I think people go into a restaurant , and somebody orders a steak , and we all know where steak comes from , and somebody orders a chicken , and we know what a chicken is , but when they &apos;re eating bluefin sushi , do they have any sense of the magnificent animal that they &apos;re consuming ?
And that &apos;s a unique opportunity , I would say , in design .
I even finished my credits on time and graduated with my class .
So this , for example , when you see bees flying around these little plants , and they &apos;re collecting pollen , those pollen grains that they &apos;re collecting , they pack into their legs and they take it back to the hive , and that &apos;s what makes the beehive , the wax in the beehive . And they &apos;re also collecting nectar , and that &apos;s what makes the honey that we eat .
And I say that not because I am African , but it &apos;s in Africa that you find the earliest evidence for human ancestors , upright walking traces , even the first technologies in the form of stone tools .
It &apos;s made life difficult in many ways , and growing up , I struggled to fit in socially .
My name is Joshua Walters .
( Laughter ) Yeah ? I would actually prefer to do it more this way .
I &apos;ve rescued children as young as three years , and I &apos;ve rescued women as old as 40 years .
You can see how we &apos;re using the science — the physics of water , light and movement — to tether that artistic freedom .
And it &apos;s such an amazing phenomenon that the fact that it &apos;s disappearing should frighten you , at least a little bit .
I was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors .
And I think that &apos;s a fundamentally interesting question .
And it &apos;s very important for research in medicine .
But I think it &apos;s a tragedy when one of them doesn &apos;t see the other .
Do you know how much of us all pretend to be somebody we &apos;re not ?
Yet , we dither , taking no action to divert the asteroid , even though the longer we wait , the more difficult and expensive it becomes .
But there isn &apos;t anyone else ; there &apos;s just you .
What &apos;s wrong with this picture ?
And not just individual machines , but fleets of locomotives , airplanes , entire systems like power grids , hospitals .
It &apos;s the institutions .
Leadership training in Google , for example , places a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities , such as self-awareness , self-mastery , empathy and compassion , because we believe that leadership begins with character .
That &apos;s a more partisan area .
BG : Yeah , well people can take , there is some aid that was well-meaning and didn &apos;t go well .
And they had the reporters and their producers participate .
So why is it so important ?
What he did is tell them it was time for them to think about rethinking what they were supposed to do .
( Laughter ) So , can you imagine New York policemen giving out condoms ?
And so now we go onto Enceladus . Enceladus is a small moon , it &apos;s about a tenth the size of Titan . And you can see it here next to England , just to show you the size . This is not meant to be a threat .
Bono spoke very eloquently , that we have the tools , for the first time , to address age-old problems of disease and poverty .
Now , not all of us have meadows , or lawns that we can convert , and so you can always , of course , grow a meadow in a pot .
We &apos;re going to face two really thorny sets of challenges as we head deeper into the future that we &apos;re creating .
But forget her breasts .
And there &apos;s nothing like swimming for 50 hours in the ocean that gets you thinking about things like this .
In fact , research has shown that the more the world is flat , if I use Tom Friedman &apos;s analogy , or global , the more and more people are wanting to be different .
But robotic weapons might be every bit as dangerous , because they will almost certainly be used , and they would also be corrosive to our democratic institutions .
All companies need to move to an encrypted browsing habit by default for all users who haven &apos;t taken any action or picked any special methods on their own .
If you were Middle Eastern — Abdel-Magied — you had to send out 64 percent , and if you &apos;re Italian , you &apos;re pretty lucky , you only have to send out 12 percent more .
But the ironic thing is that bees are not out there pollinating our food intentionally .

Because you see , whenever people do anything , for example if I want to touch this blackboard , my brain first builds up a schema , a prediction of exactly what my muscles will do before I even start moving my hand , and if I get blocked , if my schema doesn &apos;t match reality , that causes extra stress called cognitive dissonance .
It &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
The reason why I don &apos;t believe that tells us that the Neanderthals had language is — here &apos;s a simple analogy : Ferraris are cars that have engines .
And here is the long-probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic , because the mimic doesn &apos;t give it any nectar . It thought it would get some .

So let &apos;s bring a romance novelist into this conversation .
My mom plays piano , and she learned to play before they had a piano at home in Cape Breton . Before Mom &apos;s family had a piano in Cape Breton , she learned to play the rhythms on a piece of board , and the fiddlers would all congregate to play on the cold winter &apos;s evenings and Mom would be banging on this board , so when they bought a piano , they bought it in Toronto and had it taken by train and brought in on a horse , a horse and sleigh to the house .

Here is a very good example . Take Jackson Pollock , for example .
Well in 25 years I was mostly putting out pieces of this romance and not getting a lot back in because design on call doesn &apos;t always connect you with a circumstance in which you can produce things of this nature .
And I remember thinking about all the reasons why that was the case .
Now his failure to satisfy the family life , is an inevitable association of great people .
And you have some guy that you &apos;re not quite sure what &apos;s wrong with him — Oliver Sacks is going to be born way in the future .

He holds a shotgun .
And something else that happens is that those image-making regions where you have the plotting of all these neural maps , can then provide signals to this ocean of purple that you see around , which is the association cortex , where you can make records of what went on in those islands of image-making .
Here &apos;s what some of this data might look like .

Two of us seeking to change the world can actually make a huge difference .
Whereas a self-driving system can look at that pedestrian and say , I don &apos;t know what they &apos;re about to do , slow down , take a better look , and then react appropriately after that .
The first is really the notion of people .
We can start by looking to farmers like Eduardo .
They didn &apos;t think it was significant , but there was an outrage in the community .

We should always assume that someone we love may be suffering , regardless of what they say or how they act .
Unfortunately , the science is probably closer to being climatology in that in many cases , very , very small changes can have disproportionately huge effects , and equally , vast areas of activity , enormous mergers , can actually accomplish absolutely bugger-all .
But yet , we get the sensation of something happening .
The worst eras in human history , whether in Cambodia or Germany or Rwanda , they start like this , with negative other-izing .
The age of mammals had well and truly started 250 million years ago ...
Not six months later , in July 2002 , Ethiopia announced a major food crisis , to the same proportions as 1984 : 14 million people at risk of starvation .
