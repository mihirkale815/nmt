We asked them , &quot; &quot; Can you send guerrillas a message ? &quot; &quot; We collected over 6,000 messages .
Bear in mind there are two things about this .
And again , it forms the same straight line . You have a little bit of thickening in the line because people do have disagreements , what the key points are , there &apos;s differences of opinion when agriculture started , or how long the Cambrian Explosion took .
In our daily life we are continuously disturbed by aggressive sounds .
Low-income people spend a lot more than a thousand on lotteries .
We &apos;d catch cat-naps at 40 below on our sled , incidentally .
Of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular .
So she did things to us , which now she &apos;d be arrested for , such as pushing us out of the car , and telling us to find our own way to Granny &apos;s , about five miles before we actually got there .
But I &apos;ve talked about education and employment .
But perhaps the most exciting thing about it is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere .
They could be quite mild .
It &apos;s capitalism as it was ultimately meant to be , meeting important needs , not incrementally competing for trivial differences in product attributes and market share .
But I claim that B is incomparably worse .
So if I were emperor of the Internet , I guess I &apos;d still be mortal , huh ?
And it completely changed how I do movies .
And he &apos;s seriously one of the funniest — I call him Yoda , because you talk to the guy , you get an email from him , and you &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worthy . This guy &apos;s so amazing . &quot; &quot; The other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world — literally every corner of the world — into our house .
Don &apos;t start telling me why you didn &apos;t do something .
As I looked down at her in the bed , I thought to myself , if you just tried caring even a little bit , you wouldn &apos;t be in this situation at this moment with some doctor you &apos;ve never met about to amputate your foot .
He said , &quot; &quot; How did Target figure out that this high school girl was pregnant before she told her parents ? &quot; &quot; It turns out that they have the purchase history for hundreds of thousands of customers and they compute what they call a pregnancy score , which is not just whether or not a woman &apos;s pregnant , but what her due date is .
And let &apos;s say it &apos;s a foundation . They will provide the funds .
JP : Oh , hi darling , how are you ?
They &apos;re also able to reason at high levels .
Derek Paravicini : I taught myself to play .
And what can you do to challenge ?
And when people tell me , &quot; &quot; Who &apos;s going to teach the teachers to teach the kids ? &quot; &quot; I say to myself , &quot; &quot; What planet do you come from ? &quot; &quot; Okay , there &apos;s not a person in this room — I don &apos;t care how techie you are — there &apos;s not a person in this room that doesn &apos;t give their laptop or cell phone to a kid to help them debug it . OK ?
So this building actually celebrates the water as it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed so that it can be filtered for the final time .
I took this video last week . Here &apos;s a paraplegic patient actually walking by strapping on these exoskeletons .
So he was using social media in private .
Not to say , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , what is it ? &quot; &quot; but to be challenged by it — to say , &quot; &quot; Wow , this is beautiful , &quot; &quot; on one level , but on the other level , &quot; &quot; This is scary . I shouldn &apos;t be enjoying it . &quot; &quot; Like a forbidden pleasure . And it &apos;s that forbidden pleasure that I think is what resonates out there , and it gets people to look at these things , and it gets people to enter it . And it also , in a way , defines kind of what I feel , too — that I &apos;m drawn to have a good life .
We have a moral obligation to invent technology so that every person on the globe has the potential to realize their true difference .
Is there a way to produce algae inexpensively ?
And thank you very much .
If a company was going to donate a block of a decision scientist &apos;s time , it would actually make more sense to spread out that block of time over a long period , say for example five years .
You can see the different seasons there .
Of course , this was the Holy Grail of our industry , and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn &apos;t help either , because I &apos;m sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store , you know — we see his face constantly .
And scientists that have studied this have said they &apos;ve never seen an accident .
( Laughter ) But you get the picture . And then it goes to the inauguration .
There are , of course , the therapeutic results of this , but then there are the un-therapeutic ones and they seem to be the ones gaining traction , particularly in the media .
In a 12-month period when I was at the orphanage , only one child had been adopted .
And so now all the birds come in . And I have hawks .
Do you know how hard that is to avoid when you actually work at Facebook ?
So ...
You know , I like to call it &quot; &quot; the national automobile slum . &quot; &quot; You can call it suburban sprawl .
So the Cambrian Explosion , when all the body plans of the animals were evolved , took only 10 million years . It was 200 times faster .
And as for outsiders , white , black or brown , tar and feather them , and whip them out of town .
We kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics and that selects for resistant mutants .
We &apos;re really good at small numbers .
And then I thought I would share with you what that method is , or one of them .
Now what we &apos;re seeing lots of examples of , obviously , is the opening up of government data , not enough examples of this yet , but we &apos;re starting to see this practice of people creating and generating innovative applications on top of government data .
But when you shake it , you get Pakistan &apos;s perspective .
And he had to close his eyes , it &apos;s so disgusting , and the smell and everything .
&quot; Use a condom , don &apos;t get AIDS . &quot;
But first I want to say that the intensity and persistence with which we experience these emotional components of regret is obviously going to vary depending on the specific thing that we &apos;re feeling regretful about .
In particular , I &apos;m interested in the relationship to the future financial self .
An image is worth more than a thousand words , so I &apos;m going to start my talk by stop talking and show you a few images that I recently captured .
I am passionate about the American landscape and how the physical form of the land , from the great Central Valley of California to the bedrock of Manhattan , has really shaped our history and our character .
My mother in Accra , my twin sister in Boston , my best friends in New York : these relationships are home for me .
Okay ? So I want you to think about that problem as we go on , and count how many symmetries there are .
So dystonia is a disorder affecting children .

We knew conservation would fail if it doesn &apos;t work to improve the lives of the local communities .
It has taken many years , but it has been very rewarding .
You needn &apos;t bring the gun into the UK anymore .
I &apos;m showing you two works , one on the right by Leon Golub , one on the left by Robert Colescott .
And I &apos;ve been studying it for a couple years .
He died 25 years ago this year , and was born 75 years ago this year .
In countless accidents , the driver says , &quot; I didn &apos;t see it coming . &quot;
It &apos;s too much energy on a planet .
( Laughter ) Paper .
So let me tell you about the U-report , which I &apos;m really excited about . It &apos;s 150,000 millennials all across Uganda , young people armed with 2G phones , an SMS social network exposing government corruption and demanding to know what &apos;s in the budget and how their money is being spent .
It &apos;s become the de facto battle for gay equality , and it seems like daily , laws prohibiting it are being challenged in the courts , even in places like Texas and Utah , which no one saw coming .
Most of our countries don &apos;t even have any opinion research .
I &apos;ve discovered these people , who , in V-Day world , we call Vagina Warriors .
Trend-following would have been great in the &apos; 60s , and it was sort of OK in the &apos; 70s .
And you could tell very easily when your experiment was working and wasn &apos;t , and where it was in the phase .
I don &apos;t think it will transport 200 people in the next years .
MB : So I love the effervescence , bubbling up .
They don &apos;t own those facilities .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve ever felt so happy in my entire life .
I was privileged to have that kind of good start .
So , this is a six-shot sequence .
And what they &apos;re finding is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants can be highly toxic to phytoplankton , which is very bad news , because so much life depends on it .
I &apos;ll leave it at that , thank you very much .
Fast forward to 2002 .
And the rules and the belief systems were wildly disparate .
Three years later , we have the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo , Ontario . It ’ s the most exciting job I ’ ve ever had .
And that &apos;s the kind of polishing that these mirrors have endured .
I really believe that you have to have a passion for it .
Now we do daydreaming in 11 : 30 with 55 seconds left .
And that was the end of the shrinking of vacuum tubes , but it was not the end of the exponential growth of computing .
And this is the first theater project I worked on .
What you see there on the screen is a human hair superimposed on the needle that &apos;s made of silk — just to give you a sense of size .
Now looking at a few cases , here &apos;s one of the first cases that we had .
So does a site like this have rules ?
This happens because typically tumors are areas where the immune system has no access , and so bacteria find these tumors and use them as a safe haven to grow and thrive .
And she said to them , &quot; &quot; Vusi &apos;s here , and you &apos;re not going to take him tonight .
Now , the Himba live in northern Namibia on the border of Angola , and I &apos;d been there a few times before , and I &apos;d gone back to present this book I &apos;d made , to show them the pictures , to get into a discussion with them , to say , &quot; &quot; This is how I saw you . This is how I love you .
If they stick with the process , if they stick with it , they end up doing amazing things and they surprise themselves just how innovative they and their teams really are .
Now , given both the common sense and scientific data calling the doctrine of the blank slate into question , why should it have been such an appealing notion ?
I looked it up , and he was right .
♫ Not to discuss this at length , ♫ ♫ but my body image was never my strength . ♫ ♫ So frankly , I wish that you all would get dressed , ♫ ♫ I mean , you &apos;re not even really naked . ♫ ♫ And I &apos;m the one with the problem . ♫ ♫ And you tell me , don &apos;t worry so much , you &apos;ll be great . ♫ ♫ But I &apos;m the one living with me ♫ ♫ and I know how I get . ♫ ♫ Your advice is gentle but late . ♫ ♫ If not just a bit patronizing . ♫ ♫ And that sarcastic tone doesn &apos;t help me when I sing . ♫
Several Western companies are now adopting frugal innovation to create affordable products for Western consumers .
This region responds when you think about what another person is thinking .
The result : most of the deaths have been in people under 30 years of age , robustly healthy young adults .
And it &apos;s part of what TEDWomen does .
And that is the same reef ; that &apos;s the same reef 15 years ago ; that &apos;s the same reef today .
He took women with metastatic breast cancer , randomly divided them into two groups .
As a matter of fact , 1964 was the year with the highest birth rate ever in Germany : more than 1.3 million .
My desire to create a sensor-based technology perhaps stemmed from my lifelong love for sensors and technology .
And it &apos;s this convergence that gives us this incredible pace .
But the only way we &apos;re going to be able to write it is if we do it together .
And here , you can see one such example , where we label the fibers coming from the brain in red .
Just to give you a few examples : &quot; ending a pregnancy &quot; versus &quot; killing a fetus ; &quot; &quot; a ball of cells &quot; versus &quot; an unborn child ; &quot; &quot; invading Iraq &quot; versus &quot; liberating Iraq ; &quot; &quot; redistributing wealth &quot; versus &quot; confiscating earnings . &quot;
And those beautiful wispy clouds are , in fact , fires , human-made fires .
It &apos;s a gambler &apos;s game even today .
You see the heart coming out there . It takes about 40 minutes to print , and about four to six hours later you see the muscle cells contract .
I photographed him at the scene of arrest in Chicago .
You &apos;d stay until , at some point , the jail would be booked to capacity , and they &apos;d want to book someone new in .
But how can I tell an eight-year-old boy that his father is a politician ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , as a politician myself , standing in front of you , or indeed , meeting any stranger anywhere in the world , when I eventually reveal the nature of my profession , they look at me as though I &apos;m somewhere between a snake , a monkey and an iguana , and through all of this , I feel , strongly , that something is going wrong .
Even the pencil .
Now just don &apos;t untie me no matter what . &quot; &quot; He throws the first mate to the ground .
But we have to use its power wisely .
Thank you .
And there , we sat down , and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on Mt . Everest .
That gets your adrenaline going .
Right ? It &apos;s beans ; right ? It &apos;s coffee beans .
Well , if we &apos;re going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of Millennium Development Goals that we &apos;re set as a world , we need to learn from the innovators , and those innovators come from every single sector .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s pretty scary . ( Laughter )
Truth be told , I have never found a role model I could truly identify with .
But of course , that was in Austria at the height of Romantic lyricism , not here in the suburbs of Cleveland . ( Laughter )
And this excites me , because this means that the energy it takes to accommodate someone with a disability can be leveraged , molded and played with as a force for creativity and innovation .
It &apos;s got two people inside it on stilts , which give them the height , and somebody in the front who &apos;s using a kind of steering wheel to move that head .
And when you label something as objective and rational , automatically , the other side , the subjective and emotional , become labeled as non-science or anti-science or threatening to science , and we just don &apos;t talk about it .
No bill ever disappeared .
There &apos;s sustaining innovation , which will sustain an existing institution or an organization , and disruptive innovation that will break it apart , create some different way of doing it .
We know we &apos;ll use electricity in 20 or 30 years &apos; time .
They give 20 minutes — that &apos;s a time warning .
But in order to find out the real secrets of these creatures &#91; it was necessary &#93; for us to actually insert a small radio transmitter inside &#91; each &#93; snake .
In this strange moment where , like , these things kind of appeared .
So this is a — I used to kind of be an actor .
So again , the really important question is what happens when we change the statistical data ever so slightly .
Doctors have a saying that , in fact , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not dead until you &apos;re warm and dead . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s true . It &apos;s true .
It &apos;s an insult to the basic laws of nature and of biology .
So there are many reasons , and for all of these reasons , this is time and this is why we must talk .
SS : Well , on your way to the Olympics , a couple of memorable events happened at Georgetown .
I &apos;d like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward .
This object should be ice over a silicate core .
That story perfectly captures for me the final lesson that I learned : Happiness is not something we find , it &apos;s something we make .
Now we &apos;ve had 50 years of warnings .
And then Magd came .
For a minute , I felt like my existence as a person had been noticed , and I was worth saving .
That &apos;s why when , in California , we try to deal with all the solar we &apos;ve brought online — we now get about 10 percent of electricity from solar — when the sun goes down , and people come home from work and turn on their air conditioners and their TV sets , and every other appliance in the house , we need a lot of natural gas backup .
One of those most remarkable parts about all of this is it gives us an entirely new way to understand new information , stuff that we haven &apos;t seen before .
We branch off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
I had a scholarship .
Well , one of the problems , of course , turns out to be testing .
Well , you feel some chest pain or indigestion .
If you don &apos;t tell us how you did it , we won &apos;t trust you .
The Moorish artists were denied the possibility to draw things with souls .
I end with — the Koreans did this .
And that was because every hydrostatic skeleton that we had found in nature up to that point had the same basic elements .
Actually , you could say I grew up in the capital of Dominican Republic , otherwise known as Washington Heights in New York City .
Either a conscious agent is carrying out the computation , or he &apos;s got a piece of machinery that admits of a computational interpretation .
If the group doesn &apos;t take action , the other 33 groups have to decide what is going to happen to the group that doesn &apos;t comply with those great deals that we are offering them .
So what you &apos;re seeing here are a couple of machines — a pattern of locomotion .
Chris Anderson : So I guess what we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re going to talk about your life , and using some pictures that you shared with me .
This is one of the things they ought to be thinking more about .
And users , for all of us — we can demand technology that works this way .
Buy African products .
As we think about intersecting technologies — everybody has a cell phone with a camera — we could use this everywhere , whether it be health care , patient care , engineering , law , conferencing , translating videos .
( Audience : Jack of spades . ) LG : Jack of spades . Jack of spades .
In this case , they were using a real stunt man . It was a very dangerous stunt .

Hopefully everybody ? More than 10 ?
This approach is called Integrated Water Management , or holistic or closed-loop .
But here is what &apos;s really great .
We have the power to do that .
Beyond these sorts of things , a medical doctor didn &apos;t have a lot that they could do .
Go to the Open House and express your options .
I mean , it seems like you &apos;re still a little bit in the growth phases , you &apos;re still doing these incredible new plans .
They even applaud it .
And as I pause for a few seconds , have a look at the screen .
And I &apos;m just going to read one of them to you .
Would you like Kim Jong-Il , who &apos;s killed about two million people , would you like him gone ?
Essentially , here you have all the bling-bling of the world &apos;s museums organized for you .
And no TV , no radio , no newspaper , no one to talk to .
You get health insurance ? Dental ?
Imagine you are in a maternity ward in Mali , and have a newborn in need of urgent medication .
They needed fewer hospitalizations .
And nature builds large skeletons out of it .
So we can actually use biomaterials now .
( Music ) And just like that , the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality .
SPECT imaging is a brain-scanning technology that uses a radioactive tracer to track blood flow in the brain .
However , still , as you can see , it has a cord , umbilical cord . So , we &apos;re still using an external power source and external computation .
There &apos;s not one that we know of . &quot; &quot; So they &apos;re doing that , and we &apos;re going to launch it later this year , and it &apos;s all an experiment , and it &apos;s all voluntary .
So this is very conscious knowledge .
What force is driving all galaxies to rush away from every other at an ever-quickening speed ?
And the truth is I don &apos;t really understand a lot of what they &apos;re talking about .
Where &apos;s art ? I got productivity . I got sports .
When I reach the summit of a steep mountain in the middle of nowhere , I feel young , invincible , eternal .
All of these thousands of loosely connected little pieces are coming together , and it &apos;s about time we ask the question , how do we want to evolve human beings over the next century or two ?
MT : Which means magic is theater and every trick is a story .
I tried to think , &quot; &quot; How do I respond to that hopelessness ?
Four years ago , I showed you this picture .
We need to be able to measure progression objectively , and ultimately , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure .
You can &apos;t do that with head-tail-tail .
Why has it accelerated lately ?
We need lots more .
Until quite recently , we simply didn &apos;t know how many Brazilians were killed by guns .
My wife started to fine me one dollar for every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation .
This is a challenge that we share with thousands of other researchers around the world .
It was , like , this is my time for shine .
If you ask men why they did a good job , they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m awesome .
It takes what we know , and it twists it .
My foot goes down its throat . It spits me out .
We live on a planet .
The lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles — a car approaching from the front , the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads , any obstacles around the vehicle .
Also the visual separation .
A remarkable idea , and yet evidence is growing almost weekly , with new papers coming out , confirming that this does indeed take place .
And even though the color was pretty hideous , I did love the car , and it really cemented my love affair with cars that &apos;s continued on to this day .
Parents pool their money to hire some local teachers to a private , tiny , unofficial school .
And shipping is the greenest method of transport .
One billion dollars of our taxpayers &apos; money has been located in offshore bank accounts .

CA : Can we see that ? EM : Yeah .
Muzetta &apos;s family give the lie to this .
We &apos;ve driven well over 100,000 miles now totally automated .
Now this is not a problem of resources ; this is a problem of incentives .
So when I virtually touch data , it will generate forces in the pen , so I get a feedback .
( Applause )
Let &apos;s start with the hobbies . When you get dementia , it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself .
And into that ferment came the microprocessor .
I mean I &apos;ve rarely seen lines so flat .
This is a chicken with teeth .
&quot; That misses the point . &quot;
We evolved essentially from an African stock .
Right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year that I &apos;ll talk a little bit about .
And I think that can be some really good news .
It &apos;s my response , my attitude , to oppression that I &apos;ve got control over , and that I can do something about .
Well , the kids loved the food .
Staying is the new shame .
What we see is a unique , personal , virtual reality that is masterfully constructed by our brain .
If the rules for the universe are simple , it &apos;s kind of inevitable that they have to be very abstract and very low level ; operating , for example , far below the level of space or time , which makes it hard to represent things .
OK , so the question is : do we see this in the sky ?
Somebody told me today there was this thing called folders , but I don &apos;t know what they are .
But unless we start testing those intuitions , we &apos;re not going to do better .
That &apos;s getting closer .
I couldn &apos;t make it , &quot; &quot; Everyone held her breath , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Everyone held his breath , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Everyone held his or her breath . &quot; &quot; Whatever I suggested had to blend in .
In fact , I went to Nashville .
As a result , déclassé consumption is in .
How can such a thing exist as part of the real world ? &quot; &quot; And this , if you &apos;ve ever had a philosophy course , this is known as the famous mind-body problem .
I haven &apos;t been shot at in six years , and I was woken up very abruptly this morning by a nightmare that I was being strafed by aircraft , six years later .
And in fact , even in that very first event , LIGO found things that we didn &apos;t expect .
I mean , most of us know that pitch is a fundamental building block of music .
And you just saw Motts the research engineer , there , going into the MRI system , and he was wearing goggles .
Several years ago , we started thinking about it .
It becomes kite-shaped .
People began to buy their own postcards and make their own postcards .
Their treatment is a reflection of the values held beyond prison walls .
She &apos;s being filmed with a hidden camera .
That &apos;s why we all live in developer houses .
This is a very small grain of sand , this whole thing .
It &apos;s great stuff .
He asked the PGA , the Professional Golfers &apos; Association , for permission to use a golf cart in the PGA tournaments .
So when Nicolaus Copernicus said , actually the Earth is not the center of the universe , the sun is the center of the solar system , the Earth moves around the sun .
He quoted the words of all kinds of people who &apos;d had a variety of these experiences .
But really , it wasn ’ t the drugs that were important ; it was this idea that what the drugs did would help shock people out of their normal way of thinking , and getting them to forget the adult behaviors that were getting in the way of their ideas .
What you &apos;re seeing here is , we &apos;ve selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient .
And this is great because , you know , for a quarter , you can play this for a long time . ( Laughter )
You can hold it like a liver , but it has no cells ; it &apos;s just a skeleton of the liver .
For every one single neuron , you can actually have from 10,000 to 100,000 different connections or dendrites or whatever you want to call it , and every time you learn something , or you have an experience , that bush grows , you know , that bush of information .
So by the time I &apos;m finished talking here , there &apos;ll be 864 more hours of video on Youtube than there were when I started , and two and a half million more photos on Facebook and Instagram than when I started .
Using acoustic emission , you know , this little noise that you hear a structure emit , sing to you when they are stressed , and reveal the damage going on , there &apos;s a collective phenomenon of positive feedback , the more damage gives the more damage , so you can actually predict , within , of course , a probability band , when the rupture will occur .
So let &apos;s move to chapter two : the oil era .
Now , you need a laptop .
So we did .
In our fears , the characters are us .
The 20th century , the last hundred years , is riddled with disastrous examples of times that one school or the other tried to explain the past or predict the future and just did an awful , awful job , so the economics profession has acquired some degree of modesty .
If I &apos;m going to use the word &quot; &quot; Wednesday &quot; &quot; in a sentence , and I &apos;m coming up to the word , and I can feel that I &apos;m going to stutter or something , I can change the word to &quot; &quot; tomorrow , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; the day after Tuesday , &quot; &quot; or something else .
The first is electric autonomous flying vehicles .
When will it catch up ? I have to go back to very conventional graph .
So this is what Russian looks like in a visual abstraction .
So thank goodness , they can &apos;t be used to engineer viruses or bacteria .
We can &apos;t afford the fanciest places to stay at night , so we tend to sleep a lot outdoors .
The schizophrenic mind is not split , but shattered .
Sexual reproduction enters the picture .
15 years later , 14 or 15 years later , follow-up study .
And what we found was very , very interesting .
I had to practice it as a kid , and I &apos;m really sick of it . So — ( Laughter ) I would , so what I might like to try to do is to change it , to transform it in some ways , to personalize it , so I might take the opening , like this idea — ( Music ) and then I might substitute — ( Music ) and then I might improvise on that melody that goes forward from there — ( Music ) ( Music ) So that might be the kind of thing — Why thank you .
So now what I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to vary the order in which these decisions appear .
Poignant .
And also , again , it can — also , it &apos;s something that you — it is not something that is radiating outside .
Together , we looked at a variety of biological systems , ranging from natural tropical rainforests through to managed forests and fisheries .
Simply documenting these soon-to-be-demolished structures wasn &apos;t enough for me .
While browsing Facebook , I saw a photo , a terrifying photo , of a tortured , dead body of a young Egyptian guy .
And some people get rich enough , and if they have their ideals — in a sort of domestic sense , they get to acquire their perfect world .
If you look at some of these other items — concussions .
We need to build a log cabin , if you will , at the bottom of the sea .
You might enjoy the awkwardly tight , cut-off pajama bottoms with balloons .

Now looking at these images , it &apos;s difficult to grasp the scale of this operation , which can already be seen from space and could grow to an area the size of England .
Some of you might already know him .
So we really had to think about new , creative ways to flavor , new ways to cook and to change texture — and that was the main issue with this challenge .
Even though this wasn &apos;t the direction we went because the crank — it really is stupid to have it on board , by the way .
And that &apos;s to take all the CO2 , after you &apos;ve burned it , going out the flue , pressurize it , create a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it stays there .
People want to customize their lives .
So , what technology brought , through the very simple tools like these stone tools here — even something as small as this — the early bands of humans were actually able to eliminate to extinction about 250 megafauna animals in North America when they first arrived 10,000 years ago .

We &apos;ve taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit so that we &apos;ve made antagonists of the interspecies communication system .
It was 25 minutes of absolute terror that thousands of people across the U.S. felt .
But you know , there is progress being made in places like Cambodia and Thailand .
And we try to do this for as long as possible .
And it was the same — learning by rote — from primary school through graduate school .
I was so determined to survive that I used my scarf to tie tourniquets around the tops of my legs , and I just shut everything and everyone out , to focus , to listen to myself , to be guided by instinct alone .
But what I &apos;ve learned through speaking with people and writing about these ideas on my website , is that there are some tremendous strengths to being this way .
Suddenly , the two common threats that had pushed them closer together throughout decades , more or less evaporated .
Is it like gravity , which is the same everywhere in the universe , or there would be all kinds of different biochemistries wherever we find them ?
That &apos;s nice .
And let me give you two examples .
His idea of jihad was a global war of terror , primarily targeted at the far enemy , at the crusaders from the West , against America .
And so what happened — and I think there will probably be some people in the audience that will identify with this — I went to my first meeting , first at the U.N. , and that &apos;s when this all started , because that is a very male organization .
( Applause ) BG : Thank you . MG : Thank you very much .
Such hidden biases and black-box algorithms that researchers uncover sometimes but sometimes we don &apos;t know , can have life-altering consequences .
&quot; &quot; Let her go , let her go , God bless her Wherever she may be She can search this whole wide world all over But she &apos;ll never find another man like me She can search this whole wide world all over And she &apos;ll never find another man like me When I die , please God , bury me In my ten-dollar Stetson hat Put a twenty-dollar gold piece on my watch chain So my friends know I died standing pat Get six gamblers to carry my coffin And six choir girls to sing me a song Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon To raise hell as I go along

I couldn &apos;t go out and play basketball at recess without feeling like I was going to pass out when I got back inside .
So even though when the powder was poison , the friend drank the coffee and died , people say Grace deserves less blame in that case , when she innocently thought it was sugar , than in the other case , where she thought it was poison and no harm occurred .
So Netra and I really wanted to use our 200-year plan to curate this digital legacy , and not only digital legacy but we believe in curating the legacy of my past and future .
But I think there &apos;s something really poetic about using nuclear power to propel us to the stars , because the stars are giant fusion reactors .
This is what is killing productivity , what makes people suffer at work .
I challenge each and every one of you to mentor someone different .
Now , we &apos;ve gotten to a point where today , the machine understands complex events like down screens and wide pins .
It looks like a car wash . You come into your car wash .
If they &apos;re real boxes , there &apos;s not much we can do , but in a game we can just say , &quot; &quot; Right , well .
In infrastructure , let &apos;s just take one example .
It doesn &apos;t need light .
That is all aid can be .
I made a hole in the boundary wall of the slum next to my office , and stuck a computer inside it just to see what would happen if I gave a computer to children who never would have one , didn &apos;t know any English , didn &apos;t know what the Internet was .
You need also state ownership , especially of land assets , in order to build and roll out infrastructures very quickly .
That change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift , not only in the fortunes of Monterey Bay , but other places around the world .
And every single part of this mechanism is actually plausible in biology .
And so you too can type in any word or phrase that you &apos;re interested in and see its n-gram immediately — also browse examples of all the various books in which your n-gram appears .
And seeing what happens , it was OK to generalize , and say , I &apos;m sure that this will happen anytime we make one of these things .
As well as triggering severe loss of memory and mental abilities , the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer &apos;s significantly reduces life expectancy and is always fatal .
There is an invisible beauty all around us , each grain with a story to tell ...

And it hasn &apos;t been published , so it &apos;s totally privy information just for TED .
A neuron under the microscope is very elegant with little things sticking out and little things over here , but when you start to put them together in a complex system , and you start to see that it becomes a brain , and that brain can create intelligence , what we &apos;re talking about in the body , and cancer is starting to model it like a complex system .
He &apos;s thinking about what he &apos;s got to do to save himself .
( Applause ) Trans people and trans issues , they &apos;ve been getting a lot of mainstream media attention lately .
Here &apos;s sort of the end of that 10 years of work .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thanks very much . ( Applause )
It &apos;s not a matter of teaching it ; in fact , most of the schools tend to discount intuition as an ingredient of your working process because they can &apos;t quantify it : it &apos;s very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design , but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card or a newsletter .
Post-White House , he opened an investment firm called Generation , where he baked environmental sustainability and other things right into the core investment process .

The car begins to slide out , dramatic maneuver to correct it , and no change whatsoever in the mental workload .
Is our government that generous ? And maybe they are .
Now science may dismiss this methodology , but Polynesian navigators use it today because it provides them an accurate determination of the angle and direction of their vessel .
But before we get there , we &apos;re engaged in a struggle between good and evil , the good of socialism against the evil of capitalism , and the good shall triumph .
What you &apos;re looking at over here is actually the first unit that I know of of non-human currency .
The best available answer is that they were literally the earliest known works of art , practical tools transformed into captivating aesthetic objects , contemplated both for their elegant shape and their virtuoso craftsmanship .
China also believes that it is being contained by U.S. allies and by those with strategic partnerships with the U.S.
&quot; &quot; Because you don &apos;t love us , Norman , clearly you &apos;ve chosen your path . &quot; &quot; Twenty-four hours later , my social worker , this strange man who used to visit me every couple of months , he &apos;s waiting for me in the car as I say goodbye to my parents .

This may not seem to impress , but technological evolution is progressive , so another 10 , 20,000 years , and armaments technology takes you here .
And we have a school . This is our bright — we opened &#91; in the &#93; last two years &#91; an &#93; elementary school where we have 850 children , and the majority are women and girls .
( Laughter ) Thank you very much .
And I was always secretly hoping in some part of me that what was being said to me and about me wasn &apos;t ...
Every individual starts pushing in one direction and this is what happens .
The connection I have with engineering is the same as any other engineer , in that I love to solve problems .
For example , how a nightlight works , or why an elevator door stays open , or how an iPod responds to touch .
And a good example of this is the Rio Tinto , which is in Portugal .
And the reason this picture &apos;s in here is I did this slide show a couple years ago at a big economics summit , and there was a fellow in the audience who came up to me .
Since the age of five , I started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence .
Punishment and examinations are seen as threats .
We are so used to doing monologues .
They took pictures of me spread on the police car , and they laughed .
I said , &quot; &quot; And second of all , bad things happen to children every day , and if you didn &apos;t want these retinas , they would probably be buried in the ground right now .
And it &apos;ll be another six billion before that happens , and any remaining life on Earth is vaporized .
Though , I do know what this means — I think you do too .
So here &apos;s the question : Can we grow axons and neurons down these channels ?
Basically what it told me was — ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) — the kinds of countries we prefer are good countries .
The comparisons we make when we are appraising value , where we &apos;re trying to estimate how much we &apos;ll like things , are not the same comparisons we &apos;ll be making when we consume them .

They know , as someone once said , &quot; Character &apos;s who you are in the dark . &quot;
And when the land-based ice of the Arctic melts , it raises sea level .
Because when you go higher , the atmosphere is getting thinner , it &apos;s getting more unstable , the temperature is getting cooler , and you have a lot more U.V. radiation .
And he is one amazing example of what I have experienced all over Africa .
So what is a story ?
And in experimental feedings to rodents and ferrets , we found that the animals exhibit symptoms never seen with flu : seizures , central nervous system disorders , partial paralysis .
And , you know , if you think about this with the tsunami , what you have is essentially a kind of an army of local journalists , who are producing enormous amounts of material for no reason other than to tell their stories .
This was really the bastion of the French Enlightenment , and this gorgeous illustration was featured as a table of contents for the encyclopedia .
I &apos;m optimistic , because the new machine age is digital , exponential and combinatorial .
But it &apos;s a famous picture , not because of the beauty and majesty of Saturn &apos;s rings , but actually because of a tiny , faint blob just hanging underneath one of the rings .
I was ready to tell him , &quot; &quot; Listen , if someone such-and-such comes tomorrow , please tell him that it was a mistake .
Something I truly believe .
( Applause ) And why only computers ? We can just play with papers .
But 60 years of research has demonstrated that separating children from their families and placing them in large institutions seriously harms their health and development , and this is particularly true for young babies .
And I &apos;ve been very supportive until this picture shows up on my Facebook page . ( Laughter ) And I actually untagged myself first , then I picked up the phone . I said , &quot; &quot; Mom , you will never put a picture of me in a bikini ever again . &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; Why ? You look so cute , darling . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; You just don &apos;t understand . &quot;

They give rise to the trees , they create the debris fields that feed the mycelium .
You want people to use clean needles — and junkies want to use clean needles .
The teacher &apos;s role is entirely obsolete .
Now we have sprawling residential suburbias that are well distinct from production areas and commercial areas .
Dad talked a lot about bad design when we were growing up , you know , &quot; &quot; Bad design is just people not thinking , John , &quot; &quot; he would say whenever a kid would be injured by a rotary lawn mower or , say , a typewriter ribbon would get tangled or an eggbeater would get jammed in the kitchen .
And if you just go back to the previous image , and you look at this area of volatility and hostility , that a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture could have the affect of bringing all those warring factions together in a united cause , in terms of something that would be genuinely green and productive in the widest sense .
The brain will do more of whatever got that reward .
Because Ed , like Vineet , understands that our role as leaders is to set the stage , not perform on it .
What do we have to get to to achieve the Global Goals ?
So , these gloves are a little bit small on me , but here it is .
The first is that social connections are really good for us , and that loneliness kills .
Astrolabes have an incredible history .
It &apos;s a special kind of material that , when you add water , it will swell up enormously , maybe a thousand times in volume .
Learning to play piano for the first time and playing four hands with a friend , or performing a ridiculous skit with friends looking like idiots — things like that .
And so in that sense , I &apos;m much more optimistic about what humans can do .
How is that going to make you feel and what decision might you make next time ?
Look at the nuclei . The nuclei in the cell on the left is in the animal , the one on the right is in a dish .
And so the researchers asked themselves , &quot; &quot; I wonder how many times very secure , important , sensitive conversations are happening on these two-way radios where they forget to encrypt and they don &apos;t notice that they didn &apos;t encrypt ? &quot; &quot; So they bought a scanner . These are perfectly legal and they run at the frequency of the P25 , and what they did is they hopped around frequencies and they wrote software to listen in .
So as a result , I decided to open up a private practice , and I became the first foreigner to litigate in Afghan courts .
If you want to give some of your own money to punish people who aren &apos;t contributing , you can do that . &quot; &quot; And as soon as people heard about the punishment issue going on , cooperation shoots up .
It also changed our lives in many unexpected ways , and those unexpected ways we later reflected on , that eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us , and a year later , we launched Babble , a website for parents .
It &apos;s basically a nuclear-heated torpedo .
One of my mentors in life was Norman Borlaug , my hero .
This person has never been born .
And the way in which you could think about us as a species and us as a planet had just changed so much , and it was incredibly exciting .
&quot; &quot; What does it matter ? &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; A bullet doesn &apos;t distinguish between a Muslim and a Christian . &quot; &quot; This small group of women , determined to bring an end to the war , and they chose to use their traditions to make a point : Liberian women usually wear lots of jewelry and colorful clothing .
Because although she lived across the street they came from different worlds .
You were appointed a social worker .
So we tried to come up with a program — how we could remake this structure to better accommodate TED .
This was a group of eminent economists apologizing to the Queen of England when she asked the question , &quot; &quot; Why did no one tell us that the crisis was coming ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;ll never get my knighthood . I &apos;ll never get my knighthood . ( Laughter ) That &apos;s not the important point . The thing you have to remember is , these are eminent economists , some of the smartest people on the planet . Do you see the challenge ? ( Laughter ) It &apos;s scary . My friend and mentor , Tim Brown of IDEO , he explains that design must get big , and he &apos;s right .
So if you really care about strengthening families , you might want to talk to some liberal groups who are working on promoting educational equality , who are working on raising the minimum wage , who are working on finding ways to stop so many men from being sucked into the criminal justice system and taken out of the marriage market for their whole lives .
It &apos;s really taken off the ground .
( Laughter ) SM : I actually did not want to answer this on the TED stage .
So that was the second project .
( Applause ) Thanks .
Really the Sahara Forest Project is a model for how we could create zero-carbon food , abundant renewable energy in some of the most water-stressed parts of the planet as well as reversing desertification in certain areas .
And the second thing , I think , is that the world needs to have people in charge of that .
We have created more wealth in the past decade than ever , but for a majority of Americans , their income has fallen .
I grew up diagnosed as phobically shy , and , like at least 20 other people in a room of this size , I was a stutterer .
So basically , metabolism , which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next , has side effects .
I have some news for us creatives .
SS : A year . And why don &apos;t you tell them what happened right before you go run your race ?
It &apos;s easy to not see the forest through the trees .
With this simple tweak , the dance moves from being a dictation to a negotiation .
Mrs. Lois Doery , whom I later came to call my surrogate mum , read me many thousands of hours onto tape .
What &apos;s unexpected about this is that it &apos;s soft , but it &apos;s also a strong magnet .
At no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler . No point .
It turns out the stratosphere has winds that are going in quite different speeds and directions in thin strata .
I can feel your noise .
You start to realize that &quot; &quot; Hey , I could go to this live music event and have an utterly transforming experience that will cover my entire body with goosebumps , but it &apos;s more likely that I &apos;ll feel claustrophobic and I won &apos;t be able to get a beer .
Here &apos;s their jam aisle .
Christopher Soghoian : So , it would be funny if it wasn &apos;t true , but , in fact , Hacking Team &apos;s software is being sold to governments around the world .
The chef had overcooked it .
Thank you .
I &apos;ve been doing that for about 10 years .
We kind of see ourselves separate , but we &apos;re very much a part of it .
I really don &apos;t want to just say &quot; &quot; I &apos;m great , &quot; &quot; because that kind of sounds narcissistic , and then I won &apos;t have any friends .
He was about age five .
It &apos;s this crazy idea , that what seems like proof of the camel &apos;s quintessential desert nature could actually be proof of its High Arctic past .
Or if you take an American reference , to the U.S. Capitol Building and you pack 3,000 Capitol Buildings into that block , it would be equivalent to how large that block was .
The vast majority of interactions I see — and I see a lot , believe me — are positive , people reaching out to help or to connect or share information with each other .
But innovation isn &apos;t always incremental .
So he uses a lead that focuses on his shoulder girdle and his arm .
Paralysis was an opening for him .
And as I mentioned a moment ago , the core of the capitalist system has been defined by private actors .
It was quite popularly attended .
Non-mammalian animals couldn &apos;t do any of those things .
And this is the situation you see .
And we all know that &apos;s from eating too much and not exercising enough , right ?
This star is called Kepler-186f .
And besides that , there &apos;s the whole problem of getting the system into the cell in the first place .
Why is is this important ?
What do I get there ? &quot; &quot; We get a visual pattern of what these nine-year-olds called acceleration .
So people , for instance , just to gross you out for a second , had cesspools of human waste in their basement . Like , a foot to two feet deep .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you .
And Peggy Phelan reminded me that maybe my brains could be more important than my boobs .
So , here &apos;s the shot .
They have often been rejected by their families , have had bad experiences with medical care and they come to you fully prepared for you to join the long list of people who &apos;s about to disappoint them .
What does that translate to in terms of numbers of films , really ?
And what &apos;s taking place is that the beetle has got a home spot , it goes out on a convoluted path looking for food , and then when it finds food , it heads straight home . It knows exactly where its home is .
We push the pendulum back into the other direction .
What I &apos;m saying is that this is simply the best way to mitigate risk in a foraging context .
And you can not react to injustice , only to forget about it the next day , just because the rest of Twitter has moved on .
And I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had , and that is that , you know , I had expectations placed on me .
But even now , 2011 , there &apos;s still certain cells that we just can &apos;t grow from the patient .
Now the brain may not look like much from the outside — a couple pounds of pinkish-gray flesh , amorphous — but the last hundred years of neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain , and to see the intricacy of what lies within .
And I could never really understand exactly what it was , or how it was informing me .
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves , but induce immunity against other viruses .
We have no uniform policies regarding quarantine across the United States .
I think that this will result in my surgeries with a better outcome and fewer complications . &quot; &quot; What needs to happen now is further development of our technology along with development of the instrumentation that allows us to see this sort of fluorescence in the operating room .
Brad Pitt : What if I told you that I wasn &apos;t getting older ...
So imagine if Cloe had access to this real-time emotion stream , and she could share it with anybody she wanted to .
And here we are .
So , within six months Europe became the epicenter of the money-laundering activities of the world .
Namely , the extent to which you have one of these biased time perspectives .
We thought that was a good time to announce it .
There is a basic view that real value involves making things , involves labor . It involves engineering .
The reality is that covering Britney is cheaper .
So had the graduate heard the right one word , maybe he would have ended up onstage — oh , I don &apos;t know — maybe with these two .
So , the history of East Asia in fact , people don &apos;t think about nations and borders .
As we sail into an uncertain future , we need every form of human intelligence on the planet working together to tackle the challenges that we face as a society .
You already saw the work by Tony Atala on TED , but this ability to start filling things like inkjet cartridges with cells are allowing us to print skin , organs and a whole series of other body parts .
Opens it up and there &apos;s a pearl necklace inside .
Now , if I had to draw together all these different experiments in task shifting , and there have of course been many other examples , and try and identify what are the key lessons we can learn that makes for a successful task shifting operation , I have coined this particular acronym , SUNDAR .
That &apos;s the inter-monsoon , the time when the monsoon changes .
And astronomers said , if the Earth is moving and we look at a prominent star , let &apos;s say , Sirius — well I know I &apos;m in Manhattan so you guys can &apos;t see the stars , but imagine you &apos;re out in the country , imagine you chose that rural life — and we look at a star in December , we see that star against the backdrop of distant stars .
That &apos;s why I call for the &quot; &quot; Chief Detail Officer . &quot; &quot; Every corporation should have one , and every government should have a Ministry of Detail .
And he tells us to pay , but we don &apos;t speak English .
And that &apos;s the whole piece .
We &apos;ve started the first malaria treatment programs they &apos;ve ever had there .
DL : She saw fish , dolphins , whales , sharks , and even some sea turtles .
We say it becomes more strongly stratified .
The exciting news is that &apos;s starting to happen .
I became one of the working homeless .
And to build a human , you need three billion of them .
And we saw this guy , Haibao .
You can keep sitting here with us .
And here &apos;s this incredibly simple molecule , a nitrogen and an oxygen that are stuck together , and yet these are hugely important for &#91; unclear &#93; our low blood pressure , for neurotransmission , for many , many things , but particularly cardiovascular health .
It &apos;s a story about lemonade .
It &apos;s called bot or not , and you can go and play it for yourselves .
So thanks to these amazing devices , we have been able to gather precious information about tapir reproduction and social organization which are very important pieces of the puzzle when you &apos;re trying to develop those conservation strategies .
And I got three voicemails .
Sadly , a temporary weight gain can become permanent .
Now , these people making these proclamations to me were not bad people .
( Laughter ) And Ghosn came up and said , &quot; I have the car , Mr. Peres ; I will build you the cars . &quot;
We &apos;ve worked on small schools , we &apos;ve funded scholarships , we &apos;ve done things in libraries .
Kanzi and Panbanisha are stimulated by this fun-filled environment , which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities .
E : Ooooowww .
But when he died at the age of 94 , the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him .
Our ways of approaching agency and authority turn inside out to reflect the reality that no one has the answers to the challenges facing citizens in this century , and everyone has the responsibility for trying and participating in finding them .
Though , for a lot of people , the people who step into slavery today don &apos;t usually get kidnapped or knocked over the head .
Because there &apos;s a sport , there &apos;s an activity going on that we &apos;re all aware of , that we condone .
You &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s no baby in this photo , because that &apos;s not how this works , not for most working mothers .
I was 27 , and I was home from Barcelona , and I was visiting my parents for Christmas , and I was cooking dinner with my mother , and we were alone in the kitchen .
We are realizing that this is true .
In fact , the secret police of Russia was the creator and instructor of the Stasi .
That is the original slide from that year , and it has worked in lockstep obedience .
JN : It &apos;s more tangible than world peace , and it &apos;s certainly more immediate .
More broadly , it &apos;s a cryptocurrency .
Let &apos;s talk dirty .
They &apos;re very polite and they don &apos;t get so forward so quickly .
And Nike knows how to get your pace and distance from just that sensor .
Keep to the track , to the beaten track ; Memory holds all you need of the truth .
People in the center , like me , started feeling helpless .
The car is so big , the camera is so small , yet the manual for the camera is so much bigger than the car manual .
Or you could actually meet my need .
Just smart people moving bits . Different rules .
So I had absolutely no idea how that could actually work .
So what we did , we went to Alaska , which is where the grizzlies rely on really high , almost inaccessible , mountain slopes for their denning .
Number Two . Number Two . Two .
I see a lot of very blank faces .
We &apos;ve got plenty of these things .
But I &apos;m teaching them to force that savings habit .
So envision what it looks like all wrapped up .
And also , that was true of the reality of trying to educate me .
The piscivorous fish , the cobia , grouper , amberjacks , those big fish , also the tuna and sharks , are going to hit by this .
So clearly there is some effect .
New technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature ; the nature of what &apos;s happening , showing us our impact on the Earth .
Number three , please all of the people some of the time .
What this picture suggests to us is that we &apos;ve got a radical change in the way information production and exchange is capitalized . Not that it &apos;s become less capital intensive — that there &apos;s less money that &apos;s required — but that the ownership of this capital , the way the capitalization happens , is radically distributed . Each of us , in these advanced economies , has one of these , or something rather like it — a computer .

He said , &quot; &quot; He was not a very careful person as a mathematician .
Alice Walker has said , &quot; &quot; Look closely at the present you are constructing .
My wife and I adore our children .
I &apos;m saying , just do an inventory , expand your social and professional circles .
And have done experiments with about 50,000 students thus far — built , I &apos;d say , about a half dozen schools , my readers , at this point .
... I &apos;ve just ...
( Laughter ) Thank you .
As you see , everything starts to fade to black , and you see people going to sleep .
Be a part of something .
And it felt like technology should enable magic , not kill it .
Let &apos;s do something really simple .
But before I do that , let me tell you a couple of things that made this possible .
I discovered that , if I worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials , my hand really wouldn &apos;t hurt , and after having gone from a single approach to art , I ended up having an approach to creativity that completely changed my artistic horizons .
But basically , we have programs now from preschool right through university , with more and more adults starting their own Roots and Shoots groups .
In Kenya , in August , I went to visit one of the V-Day safe houses for girls , a house we opened seven years ago with an amazing woman named Agnes Pareyio .
In this kind of reactor , you can &apos;t do that .
You move on .
Our access to digital money and our ability to freely transact is being held captive by these gatekeepers .
But the story is not about these chapters .
I mean , after all , we &apos;re not trees , and most of us are not lobsters .
And I wanted to let my imagination run wild .
What about Africa &apos;s capacity to do something about these problems ?
They absolutely encouraged me to take risks , to go , to try , to try . I had an opportunity , an access to a local dance studio , and I had an enlightened teacher who allowed me to make up my own and invent my own dances , so what she did was let me make up my own ballroom and Latin American dances to teach to my peers .
I &apos;m not asking people to share nicely in the sandpit .
Well , that &apos;s a whole other lecture .
So , I want to see how these things have moved .
And if your employees can &apos;t tell them apart , neither can your consumers . &quot; &quot; Now before we started our session this afternoon , I had a chat with Gary .
( Laughter ) To reiterate the point , let &apos;s go closer into Iluvatar .
A FOXO is a protein that we found in these little , round worms to affect lifespan , and here it affects lifespan in people .
But I &apos;m actually not here to talk about fiction .
DR : Well , it &apos;s a funny thing .
I said , &quot; &quot; Excuse me , if I can &apos;t do the stunts , neither can the character . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This was a part that I was literally born to play they gave it to a non-palsy actress .
Either it doesn &apos;t exist at all , or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or some damn fool thing , but in any case it &apos;s not part of science .
And we even went as far as asking ex-commanders of the guerrilla to fly on helicopters with microphones telling the people that used to fight with them , &quot; There is a better life out there , &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m doing good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not worth it , &quot; &quot; etc .
I wanted a better education .
I &apos;ve never seen a representation of a kind of radio interference patterns , which are so ubiquitous and such an important part of our lives .
And this is the only bicyclist that I met in Pasadena , so ...
I had no idea how it was possible .
My mom applied for refugee status .
These organisms , how are they insulating against their own electric charge ?
They become rarer because we fish them .
So we have an opportunity to really open up education .
Cheryl was the nutrition director at High School in the Community in Connecticut .
What defines a story are changes , significant moments and endings .
( Laughter ) Is this how stupid people die ?
And over the course of the next half-year , he slowly learned to approximate the proper adult form , &quot; &quot; water . &quot; &quot; So we &apos;re going to cruise through half a year in about 40 seconds .
Though it &apos;s actually true , you know , the reason I &apos;m talking to you right now is because I was born in Brazil .
There &apos;s also a mission proposed for space , which hopefully will launch in the next ten years , called LISA .
What have I lost in the last decades ?
We came from two different worlds .
So we &apos;re going to have to go all-out thermonuclear response , stimulate the total cytokine cascade .
But we had to make it fairly robust , much more robust than the robots we build in our labs .
Well , what then happened over the last 50 or 60 years , is that goods have become commoditized .
Bia started a campaign , and we even watched her school 24 / 7 through webcam monitoring , and many months afterwards , the government changed their minds .
But the day after the apology , what happened ?
And medication didn &apos;t help him anymore .
Thank you .
That was a real experience for one of my patients , and when he created his mask , he was able to let go of that haunting image .
Don &apos;t put it all in the brain , but put some of the control in tuned feet , legs and even body .
Shouldn &apos;t the reputation that he &apos;s personally invested on building on Airbnb mean that it should travel with him from one community to another ?
By the time he was 20 , he was an options trader .
I had a sick body ; that was all .
He would know where things would fit in the sky .
That is the notion of investment .
At that time , I noticed that corruption , that grand corruption , that systematic corruption , was undermining everything we were trying to do .
A conductive pen from the Lewis lab at UIUC .
You can see this work . It &apos;s on the mouth of the Mersey , just outside Liverpool .
We &apos;ve allowed Judaism to be claimed by violently messianic West Bank settlers , Christianity by homophobic hypocrites and misogynistic bigots , Islam by suicide bombers .
They are culturally invisible . We do not make movies about these .
So , where do we look for inspiration ? We &apos;ve still got Bill Clinton .
Other people are going to say , &quot; &quot; This is great .
We need to get the math ; we need to get the statistics out to the American people .
My seeing her , it wasn &apos;t her , at the mailbox .
You know the words I mean ?
So , it should have happened about 480,000 years ago .
Thank you very much .
And gratefully , it didn &apos;t .
And we &apos;re going to look at their saving behavior .
After I came back home , I was wandering through the grocery store , and I froze in the produce department .
OK , now let &apos;s look at these three portraits .
I might , after all , know that she wasn &apos;t a good driver .
And in some ways we had hooked ourselves back onto this idea : cells , organisms , environments , because we were now thinking about bone stem cells , we were thinking about arthritis in terms of a cellular disease .
From alternatives to battle disease so we don &apos;t need antibiotics and chemicals anymore , to automated feeders that feel when the fish are hungry , so we can save on feed and create less pollution .
That day I ended up spending nearly 60 .
He was building a machine to do mathematics , and Lovelace said , &quot; &quot; You could do more than mathematics on this machine . &quot; &quot; And just as you do , everyone in this room already &apos;s got a computer on them right now , because they &apos;ve got a phone .
When we produce materials , we need to extract them from the environment , and we need a whole bunch of environmental impacts .
If I &apos;m the worst person in the world , you can hate me and move on .
First night in the nursing home unit where she had been in the same assisted living facility , moved her from one bed to another , kind of threw her , rebroke her pelvis , sent her back to the hospital that she had just come from , no one read the chart , put her on Tylenol , which she is allergic to , broke out , got bedsores , basically , had heart problems , and died from the fall and the complications and the errors that were there .
That &apos;s because of the language of guns .
Is matter evolvable ?
I go down into the subway — I take the subway a lot — and this piece of paper is taped to a girder .
( Music ) ( Video ) ( Children &apos;s voices ) Child &apos;s voice : There are more kids in Zaatari than adults right now .
Of course they must be more energy-efficient .
But the key one really is the encoder alone , because we can team up the encoder with the different transducer .
So they go down one side of the mountain , they go down another .
She took my clothes off , and then she pinned me down on the floor .
Everybody says that .
A great deal of them .
The idea there behind these two pictures is that the Chinese government can act above rule of law .
And perhaps more interesting , and more importantly , the question is , can you apply this model more globally outside medicine ?
Because our home is the universe , and we are the universe , essentially .
If you look at the statistics , the odds are not very favorable to us .
How much worse is B than A ?
She listens , because that &apos;s what people who tell stories do first .
We could look across time at the same people — people , for example , who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia — and ask what the contribution of mothering , of genetics are , and we could isolate third variables by doing experiments on the mental illnesses .
He studied law and philosophy with guidance from mentors , but he also realized that being a lawyer involved persuading other people , so he also studied great speeches and acting .
But anyway , take a look at its pollen .
It &apos;s a plot of intensity of light over time .
CA : And that &apos;s the same with universal flu vaccine , the same kind of thing ?
And they will start to use as much as the Old West are doing already .
And with that shift in thinking , we can now start to imagine new questions , new possibilities for robots that we might not have thought about otherwise .
You could apply that to the human brain in explaining some of the behaviors and the functions of the human brain as emergent phenomena : how we walk , how we talk , how we play chess , all these questions about behavior .
Doctor Healy then subsequently became the first female director of our National Institutes of Health .
Thank you very much .
She &apos;s the one he &apos;s looking at , and &#91; she &apos;s &#93; the one he &apos;s coming for . Can you see that ?
Man 8 : Okay , A12 , right there !
And so I consider myself one of these people , along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists , who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas .
And finally , we &apos;re going to put the Marriott Hotel and the Portola Plaza on the top .
What about what we want ?
And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , this is a little deep .
Double click on an icon , that &apos;s a cause .
So I &apos;d help her up and take both her hands and help her walk to the kitchen .
And there are people who think that the existence of my family somehow undermines or weakens or damages their family .
Famine mostly is a rural event now .
If I do it kind of right , it might move kind of like the real thing .
The scientists must insure that the ice is not contaminated .
It doesn &apos;t recognize an ironic smile , or a happy smile , or a frustrated smile .
If you see the red line , you are seeing the trail of the pigeon ; if you don &apos;t see the red line , you are the pigeon .
So whenever they &apos;d launch a big ship , they would invite some dignitary up from London on the train to make a speech , break a bottle of champagne over the bows , launch it down the slipway into the river and out to sea .
And they see what &apos;s going on .
Don &apos;t medicate kids for attention deficit disorder unless it is really , really freaking bad .
But I decided no , it &apos;s a power to prevent , because that &apos;s what I learned when I was growing up .
When you take a picture with your smartphone or digital camera , there &apos;s a lot of additional information saved along in that image .
Is change possible in our emotions , in our traits , in our moods ?
It &apos;s trying to get a grasp on you , on the firmware inside the human skull , so that it can recommend what movie you might want to watch next — which is a very , very difficult problem .
So it &apos;s a selfless act intended to benefit only the other .
The Lancet , one of the two greatest medical journals in the world , last summer labeled this a medical emergency now .
Reviews , ratings , checkmarks : these are the attestations about our identities that we cobble together today and use to lower uncertainty about who we &apos;re dealing with .
So , Von Neumann was already off in a theoretical cloud , doing abstract sorts of studies of how you could build reliable machines out of unreliable components .
The computer in your cellphone today is a million times cheaper , a million times smaller , a thousand times more powerful .
And now , under the spell of a technological illusion , we could ignore our fears and truly interact .
In my tradition , there is a gift that we have made to other traditions — to everybody around the world who knows the story of the &quot; &quot; Good Samaritan . &quot; &quot; Many people think of it primarily in terms of charity , random acts of kindness .
I &apos;ve described to you the opposite of a success story .
Well , what I can do now with my colleagues in computer science is we can create computer algorithms that can analyze the linguistic traces of deception .
And Hofstadter wrote a book called &quot; &quot; I Am a Strange Loop . &quot; &quot; In the course of that book , he describes a moment — just months after Carol has died — he comes across her picture on the mantel , or on a bureau in his bedroom .
In these rooms , the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well , and when Charlie saw this , he got really excited .
So my dream is something like this .
The dog doesn &apos;t speak English , or American , or Spanish , or French .
It was essentially India being itself .
And in a place like Kruger , the soaring elephant densities are a real problem .
My point is that you don &apos;t have to be neutral to talk .
And I still kept — so , in the last year I &apos;ve been spending time with heads of state and generals and tribal chiefs who all want this , and I keep saying , but this isn &apos;t the real thing .
There are applications you can get on smartphones for just a few dollars that do the same thing .
( Applause ) TED is all about patterns in the clouds .
Every single time , he &apos;s going to take one of these away and give the monkeys just two .
So just like personalized medicine , while you might imagine wanting to treat every patient individually , what we &apos;d like to do is build models of individual plants and then tell the farmer what kind of inputs every plant needs — the inputs in this case being water , fertilizer and pesticide .
That &apos;s one of the reasons so much of what we &apos;ve come to think of as Western science and mathematics and engineering was really worked out in the first few centuries of the Common Era by the Persians and the Arabs and the Turks .
Oftentimes , we think that we have to relate new knowledge to prior knowledge .
No , the boy said to me — the boy said to me , &quot; It would destroy me . &quot;
If you agree with the factual analysis , but you don &apos;t feel the sense of urgency , where does that leave you ?
I don &apos;t want the poetry of the calligraphy to be broken , as it &apos;s art and you can appreciate it without knowing the meaning , as you can enjoy any music from other countries .
So how could the secret of everlasting youth actually lie within the bat genome ? Does anybody want to hazard a guess over how long this bat could live for ?
That &apos;s a Boeing 707 .
Otherwise , go bother somebody else today .
Now let me tell you , if you want to experience the visceral feeling of trusting strangers — ( Laughter ) I recommend this , especially if those strangers are drunk German people . ( Laughter )
They left my chest open for two weeks .
And the second is that it could be responsible for the problem of the cold chain that I &apos;ll tell you about as well .
It shows without ambiguity that there is structural change and functional change in the brain when you train the altruistic love .
So it was pretty interesting stuff .
Then they had strangers , many strangers , judge the person &apos;s personality just from Facebook , and what they found was those judgments of the personality were pretty much identical , highly correlated , meaning that Facebook profiles really do reflect our actual personality .
These robots we &apos;re shipping every day .
And I throw this slide in — this is me , actually , two months ago — and I throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal , chambered nautilus .
They said , we &apos;ve been looking at the oceans for a long time now , and we want to tell you they &apos;re not in trouble , they &apos;re near collapse .
And the results of that are kids getting sick .
I mean , that would be a bit like asking Chris Columbus in 1491 , &quot; &quot; Hey Chris , you know , what happens if it turns out that there &apos;s a continent between here and Japan , where you &apos;re sailing to , what will be the consequences for humanity if that turns out to be the case ? &quot; &quot; And I think Chris would probably offer you some answer that you might not have understood , but it probably wouldn &apos;t have been right , and I think that to predict what finding E.T. &apos; s going to mean , we can &apos;t predict that either .
And after he would leave , women and girls would stay behind .
Well , because we can &apos;t transport books across borders , there had to be separate versions read in all the different English-speaking countries : Britain , United States , Canada , Australia , and New Zealand all had to have separate readings of Harry Potter .
So what I &apos;m asking today , the question I want to explore with you today is , what kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality ?
And the pain is not the problem : it ’ s the symptom .
In between , we want to talk to people about it .
And when the book came out , I was heralded as Africa &apos;s answer to Frederick Forsyth , which is a dubious honor at best .
Why can &apos;t we wait for them to die ?
So I want to leave that as a thought with you .
I wondered how we might interface with these animals .
I know it &apos;s not an easy thing , so I admire that you can do this .
Thank you .
In the Second World War , too , the existence of solar radiation was demonstrated by studies of interference that was detected by the radar stations of Great Britain .
Now if you think about it , in the age before GPS and radar , that was obviously a really difficult problem .
( Laughter ) And in those days , I developed an ear to identify birds just by the sound of the bangs they made against the glass .
Maybe we can collect some good password data and actually advance the state of the art here .
He can &apos;t focus , but he loves walking around and getting people energized . &quot; &quot; No one said , &quot; &quot; Get him a coach in speaking . &quot; &quot; They said , get me a tutor in what I suck at .
For about the five years after graduating from an upstanding liberal arts university , this was my day job .
That makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research .
By doing that , we &apos;ve been able to make a superfiber which is about 380 percent tougher , and 300 percent more elastic .
AB : No , we need to be polite about differences .
One trend that we notice in all those things is that the amount of energy per gram per second that flows through this , is actually increasing .
Anybody who sees this project plan needs to immediately say , &quot; I want to do this — and there &apos;s my spot ! &quot;
And off we go .
Most of them are pretty basic .
As I moved through , I achieved a very reasonable facsimile of the Maltese Falcon .
And this is one of the ways you can study play — is to get a 256-lead electroencephalogram .
Remember , our evolutionary-conserved sequences we &apos;re using on this array allow us to detect even novel or uncharacterized viruses , because we pick what is conserved throughout evolution .
Years go by , of course , and the writing , it doesn &apos;t happen instantly , as I &apos;m trying to convey it to you here at TED .
Nobel Prize nominee Hernando De Soto recognized that the key to economic liftoff for most developing countries is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land .
I &apos;m trying to say we have to combine all the systems , and with one condition : never — if you have a subway , if you have surface systems , if you have any kind of system — never compete in the same space .
Recently , I flew over a crowd of thousands of people in Brazil playing music by George Frideric Handel .
Every time I sort of pushed one down , another one would pop back up again .
And then you see a date .
The sciences , to me , are manifestations of our attempt to express or share our understanding , our experience , to influence the universe external to ourselves .
So there &apos;s a certain performance level that the computer would need to get to .
They are bird-blending machines .
( Applause )
Gloria Stuart : That was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight .
But chances are the postcard image you have in your brain is one of these , the dromedary , quintessential desert creature — hangs out in sandy , hot places like the Middle East and the Sahara , has a big old hump on its back for storing water for those long desert treks , has big , broad feet to help it tromp over sand dunes .
We &apos;ll look at ocean warming .
Now this is what you do , is you bend both these legs into a triangle , and you just wrap some tape around .
But why ?
But how would that machine then interact with reality ?
I was doing a pathetically slow speed of about 1.3 knots , and they were doing only marginally less pathetic speed of about 1.4 : it was like two snails in a mating dance .
So , let me show them to you . That &apos;s one , two three , four , five .
Yeah .
It &apos;s brilliant , right ?
My solution : Forget micro-entrepreneurs .
I actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier for creative experimentation , if you will , that we &apos;ve explored and begun to settle this wild land of the Internet and are now just getting ready to start to build structures on it , and those structures are the new formats of storytelling that the Internet will allow us to create .
Bats are also threatened in the U.S.
by which this might happen .
There are other parasites that do this — which render the host sterile .
That &apos;s the smashing part of the heel on both these images , and it gets worn away . In fact , I &apos;ve seen them wear away their heel all the way to the flesh .
But at the same time , you see this video coming up here .
Global citizens , innovators , business leaders , individuals , we need you .
And I held out my hand , reaching for something to believe in .
I think I was afraid that we would become inadvertent icons for the process of falling in love , a position I did not at all feel qualified for .
That &apos;s why we &apos;re changing the perception of insects .
It &apos;s a place where people have the longest disability-free life expectancy in the world .
WK : Yeah . The windmill .
( Applause ) Number four : giant solar flares .
It &apos;s the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all .
And here &apos;s one example that &apos;s really exciting .
But I managed to do it .
Well , it &apos;s not so surprising that they &apos;ve gone extinct . ( Laughter ) But in fact that &apos;s not why they went extinct .
But grind it , roast it , package it , put it on a grocery store shelf , and now it &apos;ll cost five , 10 , 15 cents , when you treat it as a good .
Anna Deavere Smith famously said that there &apos;s a literature inside of each of us , and three generations later , I was part of a project called StoryCorps , which set out to capture the stories of ordinary Americans by setting up a soundproof booth in public spaces .
Something between 20 and 25 percent of all life forms on the planet , including plants , are beetles .
Why is this ? I used medical college girls .
Metallic objects — albeit very small ones , a few tons at most — escaped into orbit around the Earth .
( Music ) In the year of my birth the Nintendo Entertainment System also went into development .
But I have now a message to the ladies .
Here , all this food comes off this farm , and at the end of the season there is actually more soil , more fertility and more biodiversity .
But Torvalds said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m not going to do that . &quot; &quot; His point of view on this was very clear .
And basically , we started this because we were tired of complaining about our politicians .
As you can see , sometimes a subspecies branches off .
The same countries , the same measure of inequality , one problem after another .
One two years earlier had killed more than a million people .
An anti-Sandinista guerrilla was mortally wounded as Commander Zero attacked a town in Southern Nicaragua .
So I &apos;m going to talk a little about each of them .
Visitors are transient . We want people who live here , people who have ownership . &quot; &quot; And so what we &apos;re doing is making a broad array of different ways for people to actually engage with the material inside of these galleries , so you can still have a traditional gallery experience , but if you &apos;re interested , you can actually engage with any individual artwork and see the original context from where it &apos;s from , or manipulate the work itself .
They &apos;re going to work on the genomes of the passenger pigeon and the band-tailed pigeon .
I did comic book arbitrage .
And that source is design for generosity .
Or is this just right for this place ?
See , some have decided a priori what kinds of changes they want to see , and only such changes can be called political reform .
Einstein said this : &quot; &quot; If you can &apos;t write about a subject , in a simple way , it &apos;s because , in fact , you don &apos;t understand it . &quot; &quot; So , if you ... ( Applause ) To Einstein ... ( Applause ) To Einstein ... ( Applause ) So — ah , ah , I don &apos;t have time ! — so , if you do know what you want to say — don &apos;t you ? — you are aware of what you want to say , you just have to do one thing : believe that it is possible to write in a simple way .
We know from ice core research that the transition from these cold conditions to warm conditions wasn &apos;t smooth , as you might predict from the slow increase in solar radiation .
So I think women in our society are becoming leaders , because they realize that for their future generations , it &apos;s very important to maintain our cultural identities .
And there &apos;s two things I do : When I go into a gallery , first of all , I go quite fast , and I look at everything , and I pinpoint the ones that make me slow down for some reason or other .
It &apos;s just love .
( Applause ) Thank you .
And I think these words really nail it : &quot; &quot; It means a society based upon the opinion of civilians .
The green ocean has the same clean air , but forms a lot of rain .
But in fact , what we &apos;ve seen is none of those were true .
( Laughter ) And then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these — look like jellyfish legs , also polyurethane .
It &apos;s the number one killer of women in the United States today .
A year ago in Kenya we had post-election violence .
But this phenomenal project &apos;s been happening .
Thank you .
And what that means is , you are going to walk around with your own personal genome on a smart card . It will be here .
So when Google was about to introduce Gmail and YouTube , they knew that their data storage system wasn &apos;t adequate .
And that &apos;s it , so you can just control it , wherever you want , and it &apos;s just hours of fun . And these are no longer in production , so you have real collector &apos;s items .
The age of the ocean , the tectonic plates , gives rise to a totally new phenomenon that we have heard about in this conference .
Meetup is the platform , but the value here is in social infrastructure .
One is tempted to say that today &apos;s pantheon is the Internet , but I actually think that &apos;s quite wrong , or at least it &apos;s only part of the story .
So , Steven Spielberg , eat your heart out .
So when people have started to speculate about what might have been wrong with Goliath , they &apos;ve said , &quot; &quot; Wait a minute , he looks and sounds an awful lot like someone who has acromegaly . &quot; &quot; And that would also explain so much of what was strange about his behavior that day .
I think it &apos;s important to promote in a more positive way on how we see ourselves .
Because we need an international legal framework for robotic weapons .
Design is not just for designers anymore . It &apos;s a process . It &apos;s not style .
And by sharing resources , we were able to dig deep — much deeper and longer than most media organizations allow these days , because of financial concerns .
It was developed within a two-year period and used on actual exploratory projects .
From the ease with which you swept away obstacles that no one knew could even be budged .
And I want to mention that these seals were used for stamping clay tags that were attached to bundles of goods , so it &apos;s quite likely that these tags , at least some of them , contain names of merchants .
So , natural selection will favor organisms that are more likely to cause damage .
It became the winning architecture to generate exciting new results in object recognition .
Plugged me into the wires , put me to sleep , gave me the muscle relaxant .
So , by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history , Selam unites us all and gives us a unique account on what makes us human .
Among them there was my right-hand man , Najmuddin .
The main unit will then go inside the brain .
There are four things that are critical to stopping Ebola .
Over the next two decades , we &apos;ll see the demand for energy rise by 40 percent , and the growth in the economy and in the population is putting increasing pressure on our land , on our water and on our forests .
And then he happened to stumble across a post about TaskRabbit .
I won &apos;t go into the details of why we think the universe is like this , but it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know .
And you &apos;re not going to get comfortable before you get uncomfortable .
And you can have a hundred million of these homes , and it &apos;s great because they suck carbon .
Give it a try .
We need a beautiful diversity of flowers that blooms over the entire growing season , from spring to fall .
We , all of us , are what happens when a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium evolves for so long that it begins to ask where it came from .
Is it ?
So whenever you talk about Africa , you have to put up this picture of the world from space , and people go , &quot; &quot; Look , it &apos;s the Dark Continent . &quot; &quot; Actually , it isn &apos;t .
They &apos;re more likely to feel intrigued when they encounter something that contradicts their expectations .
She said , &quot; &quot; Who is this Charles Bonnet ? &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; Did he have them himself ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; Tell all the nurses that I have Charles Bonnet syndrome . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; I &apos;m not crazy . I &apos;m not demented . I have Charles Bonnet syndrome . &quot;
It &apos;s crazy .
By last count , there were 48 different online markets that I know of .
I started thinking about this and the caviar vending machine and the Art-o-mat all together , and some reason , I was one night drawing a vending machine , thinking about doing paintings of a vending machine , and the little vial of my DNA was sitting there , and I saw this kind of beautiful collaboration between the strands of DNA and the coils of a vending machine .
I mean , they complain about it all the time .
This is Kareem &apos;s dark eyes and that &apos;s the white background that you see here .
And maybe these healing zones can sprinkle a map , little dots on a map .
In fact , this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important that I began to think about what happens with old technology .
The idea was to have — the same principal , a divided country — take cartoonists from all sides and let them do something together .
But before I go too much further into that , let me tell you a little bit about how we got started with this idea .
The waste water that leaks out is water that already now goes into that coastal environment , and the algae that leak out are biodegradable , and because they &apos;re living in waste water , they &apos;re fresh water algae , which means they can &apos;t live in salt water , so they die .
And there , in the town , he &apos;s approached by a dog who comes like this — one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries , even in America , I think , in some areas — and he &apos;s looking just terrible .
More specifically , I want you to feel like you &apos;re capable of becoming an excellent long-distance swimmer , a world-class language learner , and a tango champion .
There is a glut of film , the quality has to be raised , they need to go to the next level , but I ’ m optimistic .
People are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy .
And of course , the third motivator , one near and dear to my heart as an entrepreneur , is wealth .
( Laughter ) In any case , I didn &apos;t readily claim the feminist label , even though it was all around me , because I associated it with my mom &apos;s women &apos;s groups , her swishy skirts and her shoulder pads — none of which had much cachet in the hallways of Palmer High School where I was trying to be cool at the time .
Don &apos;t we deserve to be saved ? Don &apos;t I ?
I stopped doing surgery about six years ago and became a full-time writer , as many people know .
But it &apos;s the rideshare board , and it &apos;s basically the same thing .
And my position is that men need the very things that women have identified that they need to live the lives they say they want to live in order to live the lives that we say we want to live .
And here &apos;s another image of diarrhea .
One of my colleagues in Bulgaria , Nevena Markova , spent about 20 years studying these profiles .
And it really is reconstructing , quite accurately , teleconferencing .
Right there !
What do you have to get in order to be happy ?
In doing this , what we &apos;ve discovered is that humans are literal canaries in social exchanges .
I want you to know that there are farms out there — like Bill Keener in Sequatchie Cove Farm in Tennessee — whose cows do eat grass and whose pigs do roll in the mud , just like I thought .
We now know that there are many planets at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars .
In fact there is little evidence that there is any cognitive ability in a very young infant .
Through Haiti Rewired , through Build Change , Architecture for Humanity , AIDG , there is the possibility to reach out to 30,000 — 40,000 masons across the country and create a movement of proper building .
This is one of the reasons why Mohammed doesn &apos;t really regret dropping out of school right after his injury .
Research by Catalyst and others has shown conclusively that the more gender-equal companies are , the better it is for workers , the happier their labor force is .
I just want you to name the color of the object .
They want to go in and out of all the places they are because the thing that matters most to them is control over where they put their attention .
It &apos;s the application of massive-scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture .
We will soon be using grid computing to do pretty much everything , like adjust the data and everything that goes with the data .
It &apos;s a little hard to understand that , because you can go to a Costco in the United States and buy cheap fish .
So it &apos;s a really nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues , where we &apos;re asking people to make a sacrifice and they themselves don &apos;t really benefit from their own sacrifice .
We &apos;ve all trained ourselves to perform these utterly miraculous feats of memory using a set of ancient techniques , techniques invented 2,500 years ago in Greece , the same techniques that Cicero had used to memorize his speeches , that medieval scholars had used to memorize entire books . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Whoa . How come I never heard of this before ? &quot; &quot; And we were standing outside the competition hall , and Ed , who is a wonderful , brilliant , but somewhat eccentric English guy , says to me , &quot; &quot; Josh , you &apos;re an American journalist .
21 : 00 hours , and it &apos;s just our squad going through today &apos;s events in our heads , whether we want to or not .
That &apos;s the natural cadence of a trip .
A bigger one for you to look at .
So in the last 10 years and the hope for the future , we &apos;ve seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology , a science of what makes life worth living .
If you &apos;ve had any design courses , they would teach you you can &apos;t read this .
Once he stepped onto the floor and out of the bed , the pressure sensor would detect an increase in pressure caused by body weight and then wirelessly send an audible alert to the caregiver &apos;s smartphone .
On that view , consciousness doesn &apos;t dangle outside the physical world as some kind of extra .
But the good news is that we don &apos;t have to figure it out as we go along ; we have models , we have examples , like Benki and Sanghamitra and Jianchuan .
You &apos;ve got a coil .
Conscious but dazed by the blasts , you lay on your side and attempt to process what has just happened .
I totally want to go to that wedding .
It did not correlate with the poverty levels . It did not correlate .
And they are what give the word &quot; &quot; moonshot &quot; &quot; its meaning .
This idea of fireflies in a jar , for some reason , was always really exciting to me .
If I made the leap into these new technologies , then how did we — what happened before that ?
And an inorganic material would normally be really brittle , and you wouldn &apos;t be able to have that sort of strength and toughness in it .
SS : OK , OK , OK , two things .
No Powerpoint is used in two days .
He didn &apos;t recommend me , by the way .
How about the people who can &apos;t do that because they have no access — the people in the Midwest for example ?
And here is what we wanted to do : we wanted to make it so that sound from the world gets converted in some way so that a deaf person can understand what is being said .
In MLL , it &apos;s the middle set of genes , and in AML , it &apos;s the bottom set of genes .
We just — we go like that , and we imagine that that &apos;s what deafness is about .
This is happening by itself .
( Applause )
Three of the original eight entities were suing each other .
And here are the results of this wonderful project that is The System in Venezuela .
Today , I &apos;m here to share the experience of what it &apos;s like to be the mother of someone who kills and hurts .
We consider first that life has a body .
We obtained an influenza vaccine , we applied it to our Nanopatches and we applied the Nanopatches to the skin , and we waited — and this is in the live animal .
But she does remember one moment .
We forgot about the entire chain around us .
People were generally aware of this , but most of them felt powerless to do anything about it — until one group of citizens , just 12 regular people , put out a call on Facebook to their friends to meet in the central plaza , holding signs with a message : &quot; &quot; Renuncia YA &quot; &quot; — resign already .
It &apos;s current pleasure in exchange for future pain .
And he &apos;d tell me how he &apos;s leaving his wife , and I believed him , until I got pregnant .
So I think reason is not just some neutral tool to help you get whatever you want .
Now , when you &apos;re faced with a problem , you fall back on what you know , and all we really knew was design .
And so if you &apos;re looking for growth industries to get into , that &apos;s not a good one — protecting natural creatures . Human population is going up ; it &apos;s going to continue for quite a while .
These are actually cells that we obtained .
We &apos;re adding life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
And then I started rubbing , very very gently , till some of the edges were quite square . And then I constructed it .
How can we know what &apos;s causing the observed warming ?
A race of advanced extraterrestrials watching our solar system from afar could confidently predict Earth &apos;s final doom in another six billion years .
It &apos;s too slow .
And I succeeded .
Many of them are too young to run for president , but by putting the issues out there , they are influencing the presidential race .
Now , we can speculate and philosophize this , but we don &apos;t actually have to for the next hundred years .
HA : Yes , I was working in a tough situation , very dangerous .
We flew into a town that had a static , outdated website and a frenetic Facebook feed , trying to structure the response , and we launched our platform .
That would be very sad .
( Laughter ) So you can &apos;t actually see them , but it was breathtaking , believe me . ( Laughter )
We mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy .
So in my opinion , the research evidence is compelling and the logic of this is compelling .
So , all in all , in an age when the visual image of any kind was rare , tapestries were an incredibly potent form of propaganda .
Sadly , it &apos;s come true . Malaria , as we all know , kills approximately one million people a year .
There are 168 hours in a week .
And the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty .
This image is totally incorrect , totally incorrect .
I did that . Me !
That &apos;s where all these problems come from .
Everyone wants an AIMS center in their country .
I said , &quot; &quot; Probation ? I &apos;m already on probation , that don &apos;t matter ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It was academic probation , not criminal probation .
Children dress with very colorful , colorful clothes , and it is incredible to see the power that this has in the hands of kids , in a computer . And I have to tell you that it &apos;s so easy to appreciate the impact that access to technology and connectivity can have in the lives and education of these kids .
More participation , more peer coordination , sometimes distorts outcomes and there are some things , like things , for example , in the medical profession that we want new power to get nowhere near .
We just need a time machine .
The Harvard men never ask that question .
She thought my side beat up on her side way more often , that we called them brainless , gun-toting racists , and we both marveled at the labels that fit none of the people we actually know .
And I got really good at predicting how many body bags you would need for the people who were going to die in these camps .
It &apos;s a feature .
They have to try and attract pollinators to do their bidding .
It &apos;s happening .
And the reason is simple : because wind builds up the sand , gravity makes it fall .
And so it was then that I realized there was an opportunity for me to collaborate with these scientists , and so I jumped at that opportunity .
People seem to do a limited amount of strategic thinking using theory of mind .
And we &apos;ve got , as is the case around the world , about 95 percent of all loans returned .
If we ended recruitment fees for migrant workers ?
The girls are brought up to be mothers .
When I was nine years old , my mom asked me what I would want my house to look like , and I drew this fairy mushroom .
And we spent that time designing interactive prototypes for computer software and testing them with little girls .
But I knew that epidemics emerge along the fissures of our society , reflecting not only biology , but more importantly patterns of marginalization , exclusion , discrimination related to race , gender , sexuality , class and more .
In the hospital , they have to speak English .
I remember , for some reason , that they were exactly the same height .
The whole surface of it is covered with 60 million diodes , red , blue , and green , that allow you to have a high-resolution picture , visible in daylight .
The second challenge I have is that I must ask for understanding and even compassion when I talk about my son &apos;s death as a suicide .
Now , we were lucky with our hand-cleaning .
Like all stories , fears have characters .
Through history , people have gone back into their own pasts , sometimes to a precious time in their life , to their childhood , and often , the mind gravitates in the past to a moment of shame , some sin committed , some act of selfishness , an act of omission , of shallowness , the sin of anger , the sin of self-pity , trying to be a people-pleaser , a lack of courage .
This is done entirely using , kind of , the tools that are built into Second Life , so the innate concept of becoming pregnant and having a baby , of course — Second Life is , at the platform level , at the level of the company — at Linden Lab — Second Life has no game properties to it whatsoever .
What we need to think about perhaps for Mission Blue is increasing the biologging capacity .
The old-fashioned lightbulbs , the incandescent bulbs — I &apos;m not going to ask for a show of hands of how many of you still have them in your homes , wasting energy every time you switch them on — change them after this — or whether we have them on the stage here at TED or not — but those old incandescent light bulbs really should have been sold as heaters .
That &apos;s what we want to see . That &apos;s why it &apos;s hard .
We can study the way that one person interacts with another person , turn the numbers up , and start to gain new insights into the boundaries of normal cognition , but more importantly , we can put people with classically defined mental illnesses , or brain damage , into these social interactions , and use these as probes of that .
I mean , really , same example : if you don &apos;t like politicians calling each other names , stop clicking on the stories about what one guy in one party called the other guy in the other party .
The next was to add mobility — so , have the screen on a mobile base .
When we think about human capital we think about the things we can measure easily — things like grades , SAT &apos;s , degrees , the number of years in schooling .
That if you live in the best climate , in San Diego in the United States , or in the shittiest climate , in Buffalo , New York , you are going to be just as happy in either place .
And against the odds , we found a match for her , who turned out to be me .
We &apos;re kind of stuck in a loop , perhaps , and this sense of possibility from computing is something I &apos;ve been questioning for the last 10 or so years , and have looked to design , as we understand most things , and to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine .
Well , you know , we should expect to see that .
But there was a pretty big problem with this .
I know , I think we should keep them as a surprise .
But what we don &apos;t have is a really good model of human psychology .
People say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s wrong with having a conversation .
As you might know , proteins are large biological molecules that perform different functions within our body , like catalyzing metabolic reactions or responding to stimuli or replicating DNA , but before a protein is expressed or produced , relevant parts of its genetic code present in the DNA are copied into the messenger RNA , so this messenger RNA has instructions on how to build a specific protein , and potentially it can build hundreds of proteins , but the one that tells them when to build them and how many to build are microRNAs .
Here that same line of text wraps around a fountain in an illustration that can be turned upside down and read both ways .
So finally , I would like to say , so let &apos;s help Africa walk upright and forward , then we all can be proud of our future legacy as a species .
Then there &apos;s the point of embarkation , that is , the point of transition from ordinary life to being a pilgrim on a quest .
So , when the visitors come , MARS walks up to the computer , starts typing &quot; &quot; Hello , my name is MARS . &quot; &quot; Welcome to RoMeLa , the Robotics Mechanisms Laboratory at Virginia Tech .
And we &apos;ve just over the last few years found out that the microbes in different parts of the body are amazingly different from one another .
I have a bunch of other inventions .
But today , the international drug control regime is starting to crumble .
Is &quot; &quot; better off &quot; &quot; finding a secure job that you can count on for the rest of your life ?
And there are others who are extremely high .
Because that &apos;s when implanted devices inside of people started to have networking capabilities .
You won &apos;t do that by accident ; you will do that because you are guided to do that .
You might recognize him from the previous demos .
We know that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the United States .
And it &apos;s really important you understand that for civilization to make progress , each generation has to do better than the last one .
So instead of starting little websites like the kids in Palo Alto do , the kids in Shenzhen make new cell phones .
Leading with beauty means rising above what is merely necessary .
I worked in tourism for one year in Mexico , one year in Egypt .
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and creepy — obviously in an effort to drive maintenance engineers crazy , that they would not be able to figure this out quickly .
So you get to experience that in real time , right ?
I found a problem , a specific problem that actually found an error with that .
I swear to God . I mean , when you look at the box , and you sort of see how it works .
And the bubbles keep moving up there , and this is what the world looks like today .
And we have had some significant successes .
Think about it : if you were sitting there in 1750 trying to figure out the big changes coming to society in the 19th , the 20th centuries , automated machines , computers , artificial intelligence , a programmable flute entertaining the Parisian elite would have been as powerful a clue as anything else at the time .
Then you see his left leg .
Another is , you can make NGOs accountable .
And so the present self can trounce all over its dreams .
If we add water , what will happen is , this swellable material is going to absorb the water , the polymer chains will move apart from each other , and the entire material is going to become bigger .
If you take the camera above , you start thinking about these numbers again .
This gives a tremendous advantage to the attacker , because the defender doesn &apos;t know who to fight back against .
How do you have safer sex , how do you use a condom regularly if there hasn &apos;t been disclosure ?
And software companies make 35 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades .
Now , I don &apos;t want to create the misimpression that China &apos;s hunky-dory , on the way to some kind of superpowerdom .
I &apos;m really worried that , especially kids today , they &apos;re not going to be dealing with this down-time , that they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture , and that everything comes to them , and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it .
More than half .
And that , of course , had been a question I wanted to know .
And I know I &apos;ve performed for some of your companies or some of you have seen me elsewhere , but this is honestly one of the best audiences I &apos;ve ever experienced .
We have like 40 kids , ex-child soldiers mixed with anybody that we feel like we want to support .
And so it is not just what &apos;s happening to these people — whether they &apos;re losing weight or gaining weight , or becoming rich or becoming poor , or becoming happy or not becoming happy — that affects us ; it &apos;s also the actual architecture of the ties around us .
So now you have an evolutionary excuse .
She feels different .
India is coming on line .
And I certainly didn &apos;t do myself any favors .
It &apos;s part of our survival package , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s become so important for us , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re always listening at that level .
But also , these cultures , these indigenous cultures , are disappearing much faster than the forests themselves .
So I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Mr. Huf isn &apos;t going to be very happy when I told him his house has gone to another , into the atmosphere somewhere . &quot; &quot; So to cut the story short , I decided that I had to go back and do it .
As a Frenchman , I must say that there are a lot of French intellectuals that think happiness is not at all interesting .
I asked people to anonymously share an artful secret they &apos;d never told anyone before .
Again , the research shows that we prefer voices which are rich , smooth , warm , like hot chocolate .
That &apos;s what fear and anxiety does ; it causes you to be — what &apos;s called depth-first processing — to focus , not be distracted .
It goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle , then the junior non-manual , going up high to the professional occupations — doctors , lawyers , directors of larger companies .
Choose to see through them .
Well , that is what the US government has determined that the cost of owning a car is per mile .
But in a way , you know , it &apos;s the same if I look at you and I see a nice bright young lady with a pink top on .
The answer is : long-lived molecules , because if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage , but then the molecule is destroyed — like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis — then the damage is gone , too .
It would be easier for other people to wear the helmet and record their eyes .
And this is Von Neumann and Morgenstern , who wrote the &quot; &quot; Theory of Games . &quot; &quot; All these forces came together there , in Princeton .
And the next steps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years .
Something was missing , you know . I mean , these are — it &apos;s kind of weird to think that someone had to do an experiment to show that , but that was what was going on at the time .
There were like 20 people there .
I actually shared that with some legislators here in the U.S.
They engage in mental time travel . They remember what happened yesterday .
So that &apos;s the good news .
Please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike , or breath , is being pulled . Just experience the whole journey of that sound in the same way that I wished I &apos;d experienced the whole journey of this particular conference , rather than just arriving last night .
Well , in the mid- &apos; 70s , there were not great opportunities for a bioengineer like me , especially in Italy , and so I decided , with some researchers from the United States and the University of Florence , to start probing the murals decorated by Vasari on the long walls of the Hall of the 500 searching for the lost Leonardo .
So if you take a deeper look at the brain , one of the things , if you look at it in cross-section , what you can see is that you can &apos;t really see a whole lot of structure there .
And so in this trailer I took it upon myself to think about travel , and escape , in an idiosyncratic sense .
I have a wonderful husband , a wonderful husband who supports me despite all the criticism he gets from the society .
You can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem , even if the problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism .
Can you see here what Japan did ?
In Ethiopia , for example , the variation in maize prices from year to year is as much as 50 percent annually .
( Applause ) So , very briefly , I &apos;ll just explain to you how this is done , because that &apos;s the more interesting part .
This is a woman who is now working at the orphanage , whose son had been adopted .
Does anyone know what this is ?
And you can think of it in terms of a game-theoretic payoff matrix .
Since you have to pay for the nurse anyway , the cost per immunization ends up being cheaper if you give incentives than if you don &apos;t .
I made a stacking board .
I plug in again the power to it .
( Music ) ( Applause )
And what &apos;s amazing is , even though we flew very high above this forest , later on in analysis , we can go in and actually experience the treetrops , leaf by leaf , branch by branch , just as the other species that live in this forest experience it along with the trees themselves .
If we can actually have a broader theory of value creation and allow us to actually admit what the state has been doing and reap something back , it might just be that in the next round , and I hope that we all hope that the next big revolution will in fact be green , that that period of growth will not only be smart , innovation-led , not only green , but also more inclusive , so that the public schools in places like Silicon Valley can actually also benefit from that growth , because they have not .
And with this detailed information about the real quality of life in this part of the country , Imazon and other partners from government , business and civil society can work together to construct a development plan that will help really improve people &apos;s lives , while protecting that precious global asset that is the Amazon Rainforest .
At the end of this day I could have filled a book just with stories about law from this one teacher .
And I &apos;m convinced that those who see their world as movable nodes and links really have an edge .
She earns around 12,000 rupees .
Three . Five . Three . Five . Five . OK .
This is really , in fact , a television broadcasting a show 24 / 7 called &quot; &quot; We &apos;re Normal . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re normal , we &apos;re normal , we &apos;re normal , we &apos;re normal , we &apos;re normal .
And that &apos;s why you don &apos;t need to model the glass .
And that was actually an excellent business , because we provided jobs for women all around our neighborhood .
Are you restricted by , say , racism , from feeling fully at home where you live ?
And there you see the tail of that great beast wrapping around me .
But I &apos;m not going to the east , because I don &apos;t know Swahili .
&quot; I will be swimming around in you for the rest of your life , &quot; I told my slightly horrified sister .
We won &apos;t talk about that anymore . It &apos;s too depressing .
The 300 people below deck were doomed .
If you want to go beyond a tinkering , if you want to go beyond a hobby of robotics and really tackle the grand challenges of robotics through rigorous research we need more than that . This is where school comes in .
So here &apos;s the pitch : I think it &apos;s important that we don &apos;t just get on this freeway to ICU without thinking hard about whether or not that &apos;s where we all want to end up , particularly as we become older and increasingly frail and ICU has less and less and less to offer us .
And I said , well , in the same way that they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization — and then they all sort of leaned in — they let go of a protein that stops the crystallization .
Here , every single student has to engage with the material .
CA : Traditional wisdom is that it &apos;s pretty hard for married couples to work together .
And I think it would be important for audiences to demand more buttons on their favorite websites , buttons for example that say , &quot; &quot; If you liked this story , click here to support a cause your storyteller believes in . &quot; &quot; Or &quot; &quot; click here to contribute to your storyteller &apos;s next big idea . &quot; &quot; Often , we are committed to the platforms , but not necessarily to the storytellers themselves .
All the human intelligence put in organization design — urban structures , processing systems — what is the real goal ?
And you don &apos;t leave them where they are . You nudge them forward .
I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re buying one military and you &apos;re operating another , and eventually it &apos;s going to hurt . It &apos;s wrong .
And this is Bishop , one of our robots .
Now that includes the cost of military and the cost of the fuel both .
My partner , M , who &apos;s a tech guru , hacked WordPress .
She &apos;s got a big smile . She &apos;s got a big personality .
You type in what you want , and it gives you the translation .
The courts have said over and over again , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t need any more intellectual property protection . &quot; &quot; When you look at copies like this , you wonder : How do the luxury high-end brands remain in business ?
There was no inflation .
The point is that the news media preferentially feeds us negative stories because that &apos;s what our minds pay attention to .
The perverse at heart will seek out the ambiguities , trying to create discord by pinning down meanings of their own .
I &apos;ll follow the rats . &quot; &quot; Then I started going into the tunnels , which made me realize that there &apos;s a whole new dimension to the city that I never saw before and most people don &apos;t get to see .
When I talk to my students about global issues , and I listen to them in the coffee break , they always talk about &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; them . &quot; &quot; And when they come back into the lecture room I ask them , &quot; &quot; What do you mean with &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; them &quot; &quot; ?
So what should we be doing with that guy &apos;s data ?
Visceral is subconscious , you &apos;re unaware of it .
I want you guys to imagine that you &apos;re a soldier running through the battlefield .
And the reason it has a fountain in the courtyard is I wanted one and I had the checkbook , so I bought one and put it there .
Now , that &apos;s really tough to do with a hall that has 1,100 seats .
Child : Our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write .
They enter the queue , they just zip right out .
I &apos;m going to make an argument today that may seem a little bit crazy : social media and the end of gender .
I kind of woke up to this bit in the late &apos; 90s when I met this guy .
And meditation or self-inspection is one of the ways — again it &apos;s not the only one — it &apos;s one of the ways of gaining this kind of inner power .
There &apos;s an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there , experiencing the sun &apos;s demise , but any life and intelligence that exists then will be as different from us as we are from bacteria .
He would send me a fax and show me something .
The next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of jam .
Everything else on there is a labor of love .
So let &apos;s take an example that we all face : chat — text messaging .
If you had told me that this smart , funny , sensitive man who adored me would one day dictate whether or not I wore makeup , how short my skirts were , where I lived , what jobs I took , who my friends were and where I spent Christmas , I would have laughed at you , because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in Conor at the beginning .
So go away from your comfort into a bigger , brighter thing , because that is how we will stop another Ferguson from happening .
What about Africa &apos;s population ? The population isn &apos;t out of proportion to its area , but Africa leads the world in deaths from often preventable causes : malnutrition , simple infections and birth complications .
The thing on the right is a snake form , a ziggurat .
It &apos;s the only place where you can produce , actually , osmium .
Saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons .
And it was also the beginning of our discontent , because if you wanted to distill all of our experience since the Paleolithic , it would come down to two words : how and why .
Right , Bradley , okay , excellent point .
Secondly , drug companies are not going to develop really sophisticated psychoactive drugs . We know that most mental illnesses have a biological component that can be dealt with .
And I can get really despairing . I &apos;ve spent a lot of the last few years really depressed about this , until this year , I learned something that I felt really excited about . I feel like it &apos;s really good news , and it &apos;s so shocking , I don &apos;t like saying it , because I think people won &apos;t believe me .
When you try to solve really complex social problems , the right thing to do is most of the time to create the incentives .
I don &apos;t know who the people in your life are .
So imagine that right now I handed each and every one of you a thousand U.S. dollars — so 10 crisp hundred dollar bills .
To really get the money shots , it &apos;s down to being in the right place at the right time .
He did it , he succeeded .

And as recently as 15 years ago , there were a lot of scientists who thought these technologies wouldn &apos;t work .
That data is logged . We &apos;re logging about 500 different parameters within the data systems , about 13,000 health parameters and events to say when things are not working the way they should do , and we &apos;re sending that data back to the garage using telemetry at a rate of two to four megabits per second .

We &apos;re going to talk — my — a new lecture , just for TED — and I &apos;m going show you some illusions that we &apos;ve created for TED , and I &apos;m going to try to relate this to happiness . What I was thinking about with happiness is , what gives happiness — or happiness , which I equate with joy in my particular area , and I think there &apos;s something very fundamental .

It &apos;s called batting average .
Experimentally , this is what we &apos;ve done in the last year .

Now , I showed this to a physicist friend of mine who has a profound distaste for biology , and he says , &quot; &quot; That ’ s easy ! The things are a different color ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We have to go a little beyond that . Now let me explain why vibrational theory has some sort of interest in it .

Well , Steve noticed that and he said , &quot; We &apos;re not going to let that happen to our product . &quot;
Since it &apos;s organic , I &apos;m really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals .

they said that is the dumbest thing you &apos;ve ever said .
No ? Now ?
Ordinarily , the pendulum would just swing back into the other direction .
They &apos;re psychiatrists .

So this is Mr. Perry . He &apos;s the assistant superintendent .
There was an article which was run by AP , on the wire .
Text messaging : that was originally designed for people who are Deaf .
So , that &apos;s very intuitive , and that &apos;s what we want .
If we could do that , this could be extremely powerful .
Democracy matters because it reflects an idea of equality and an idea of liberty . It reflects an idea of dignity , the dignity of the individual , the idea that each individual should have an equal vote , an equal say , in the formation of their government .
Suppose that two American friends are traveling together in Italy .
This is the situation in Qatar , for those who don &apos;t know .
( Applause ) I was trying to think of the right model to describe this form of random acts of kindness by geeky strangers .
Now what about goals ? Where are we going toward ?
Maria was in a car accident , and she woke up on her 16th birthday to the news that she was a complete quadriplegic , had no movement from the neck down , had damage to her vocal chords , and she couldn &apos;t talk .
All right . So , like all good stories , this starts a long , long time ago when there was basically nothing .
Lidia Yuknavitch : I &apos;m making a confession : I stole three linen napkins — ( Laughter ) from three different restaurants .
It &apos;s called retro-vaccinology , and its implications extend way beyond that of just HIV .
TR : Ninety-nine . Well , that &apos;s an improvement .
So we tried to come up with a way , as a group , to have a kind of design SWAT team .
So the best that our little savings accounts or retirement accounts can do is to try to catch some waves in the good cycles and hope that we don &apos;t get inundated in the turbulent ones , but certainly our decisions on how to steer our little retirement accounts don &apos;t affect the tides , don &apos;t change the shape or size or direction of the waves .
So we began with a card table in the clinic waiting room — totally lemonade stand style .
But he &apos;s about to dispel the gloom by using those bright colors right underneath Noah : emerald , topaz , scarlet on the prophet Zechariah .
Your pupils dilate , your muscles contract , your Spidey sense tingles , basically your whole body is trigger-happy . ( Laughter ) That condition is not conducive to performing folk music . ( Laughter )
He said , that &apos;s what flutes are for — to be played well .
Now , if we do that , if we put the resources and the focus to it , what does it actually cost to get people out of slavery ?
This , of course , is not true for the students who graduate from the top institutions , but for many others , they do not get the value for their time and their effort .
I met women running essential oils businesses , wineries and even the country &apos;s largest advertising agency .
Let &apos;s look at some videos of what happened when we tested these new drugs in worms .
Africa has been good to us ; it is time for us to give back to Africa .
( English ) Omer my brother , I will always love you .
We was so , so stupid . The most stupid bacteria .
But in gay men , you &apos;ve got quite a dramatic rise starting three or four years after treatment became widely available .
But in the last few decades that has totally changed .
Except for my son , who said , &quot; &quot; Well , he could have two dads . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) That &apos;s an index , an indicator of how things have changed .
Somebody get the front legs .
And what do we teach in these schools ?
I study how the brain processes information . That is , how it takes information in from the outside world , and converts it into patterns of electrical activity , and then how it uses those patterns to allow you to do things — to see , hear , to reach for an object .
So it was pretty obvious after this process that , well , we chicken out here and go away because it &apos;s too tense , or we go even further in asking , what else is bothering you ?
They use these to design with and they design for them , which is why we end up sitting in restaurants that look like this — ( loud crowd noise ) — and sound like this , shouting from a foot away to try and be heard by our dinner companion , or why we get on airplanes — ( flight attendant announcements ) — which cost 200 million pounds , with somebody talking through an old-fashioned telephone handset on a cheap stereo system , making us jump out of our skins .
And if it isn &apos;t then it produces a shape which is very phonaesthetically tightly coupled to the sounds you made .
We can &apos;t pick the future , but we can steer the future .
Shared memories — that &apos;s where the old BBC building was ; and personal memories — that &apos;s where I gave my first kiss .
In 2001 , this building received an award .
Owl , yeah .
Doctor , whatever you say , I accept it .
And what was really great is , I &apos;m putting all this work together in the background , and Laura sent me a follow-up email because a good month had passed by .
And that is a slide taken from a TV set and it was pre-processed to be very sympathetic to the TV medium , and it absolutely looks beautiful .
We &apos;re doing this at the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute in the Women &apos;s Heart Center .
1.1 million of them .
It &apos;s Saturday . It &apos;s the holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot; Because I have to exchange your father &apos;s underwear . &quot;
Now imagine what these already ingenious communities could create themselves , and how highly particular their solutions would be , if they were given the basic infrastructures that they could tap into .
( Laughter ) This science is different , more general , than the mathematics-based science that we &apos;ve had for the past 300 or so years .
And so that gives you an idea of how exquisitely sensitive this is .
The Maasais , the boys are brought up to be warriors .
Well , I was very sorry to point out that the pure man &apos;s mind has , in fact , seen at long last what had been seen for a long time .
Well , &quot; &quot; Rare Earth &quot; &quot; actually taught me an awful lot about meeting the public .
And that &apos;s good , it gets two plusses .
What they do best is make a synthesis of human needs , current conditions in economy , in materials , in sustainability issues , and then what they do at the end — if they are good — is much more than the sum of its parts .
So this also works for the house , for at home .
We make it ourselves .
The instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification , etc . , etc .
CA : Ed , thank you .
Now you might ask yourself , how did he do that ?
So the first example I &apos;m going to talk about relates to children with learning impairments .
And obviously he never came down . The statement was never made .
We were living through a time of tectonic shifts in ideologies , in politics , in religion , in populations .
But I &apos;ll try to convince you that spectroscopy is actually something which can change this world .
It &apos;s been a privilege talking to you .
So we took these hundred dollar bills , and we put them on a website called TenThousandsCents.com , where you can browse through and see all the individual contributions .
Fold .
Now , you might think , well , we &apos;re human because of our DNA , but it turns out that each of us has about 20,000 human genes , depending on what you count exactly , but as many as two million to 20 million microbial genes .
This fabrication of place could be one of the world &apos;s greatest achievements , because no one belongs here ; everyone does .
let &apos;s say the revenue of Microsoft .
Some dancers , when they &apos;re watching action , take the overall shape , the arc of the movement , the kinetic sense of the movement , and use that for memory .
Now I cannot tell you how incredibly excited the U.S. military was by the news of the Norden bombsight .
And , of course , graphics : Today 84 dollars and 97 cents at Best Buy buys you more graphics power than you could have gotten for a million bucks from SGI only a decade ago .
And those are the questions that inspired my new project , which is debuting here today at TED .
( Laughter ) Just for my workshop .
And the purpose is not to walk in and construct a home and live there .
These structures are called cilia , and they actually move the mucus out of the lung .
So it &apos;s very well known to engineers , not as well known to biologists .
And what &apos;s exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors who are building innovations that recognize that what people want is freedom and choice and opportunity .
And one of the reasons is , in South Africa , it costs 100 dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity .
But you &apos;re going to get home and realize how different life is . &quot; &quot; And I got home and something happened .
They carried me around and put me on the table , and put the knife between my legs .
Two million years ago humans evolved in Africa and then slowly but surely spread out across the entire planet by reaching into the wilderness that was beyond their horizons .

On 9 / 11 , Joel wasn &apos;t in New York . He was out of town , but he raced back to the city , and raced down to the site of the destruction .
They teach us about what happens in the complex organism .
And so for me , a mesh company , the &quot; &quot; classic &quot; &quot; mesh company , brings together these three things : our ability to connect to each other — most of us are walking around with these mobile devices that are GPS-enabled and Web-enabled — allows us to find each other and find things in time and space .
And again , we can see it in slightly different form there , with the bubble forming and collapsing between those two surfaces .
So we came up with one neighborhood typology — there are several — called a live-make neighborhood , where folks could reappropriate abandoned structures and turn them into entrepreneurial enterprises , with a specific emphasis on looking at the , again , majority 82 percent African-American population .
So that &apos;s , as I said , the little diversion on my main love .
I turn them into two and three-dimensional pieces and sculptures and installations .
It &apos;s as though you made something resonate within them .
Or maybe it was 31 and a quarter percent .
Let me give you another example of delegation .
Particularly if we continue to approach the transformation of organizations the way we always have been .
Life in Space is really not necessarily about how we do things , but why we do things .
There &apos;s a much deeper connection , which I don &apos;t have time to go into and that is that modern genetics is a really exciting area of science .
Here &apos;s the second reason .
They also kiss , hold hands , pat one another on the back .
You need to understand that in those places what really mattered was , firstly , the role of Tudman and Milosevic in coming to the agreement , and then the fact those men went , that the regional situation improved , that the European Union could offer Bosnia something extraordinary : the chance to be part of a new thing , a new club , a chance to join something bigger .
Now , that &apos;s the good news .
The kids of today , they tap , swipe and pinch their way through the world .
And immediately , a lot of different responsibilities , in terms of my education and so forth , were heaped upon me .
And scientists have a lot of theories about why this is , but almost all of them involve nutrition , namely the increase of dairy and meat .
You look outside : you have all that beauty that you see , all that life that you see around you , and here we have intelligent people like you and I who are having a conversation here .
Thank you very much .
If you go on the streets of India and China , you see this kind of stuff .
They also get free land in between the trees , where they can grow their crops .
They did not have any pardas inside their body , hijabs inside themselves ; they &apos;ve crossed the barrier of it .
They sit , they watch the goldfish in the fish tank , they read extremely old copies of Good Housekeeping magazine .
On the graph paper , you can see how all the lines on the graph paper have been distorted .
Since there was nothing there , you might as well not look .
If you wanted to put all of the published works online so that anybody could have it available , well , how big a problem is it ?
( Applause ) But something as basic as happiness , which 20 years ago would have been just something for discussion in the church or mosque or synagogue , today it turns out that there &apos;s dozens of TED-like questions that you can ask about it , which are really interesting .
I did it for your own good .
And so they did .
This simulation was run on 1,000 processors for a month in order to make just this simple visible one .
The architecture is telling a story . The architecture is telling a story
That &apos;s the alliance that changes the world .
We set out to do this .
Their job is to get things done , and if they don &apos;t , they &apos;re out of a job .
It was a bunch of people who wanted to bring in democracy because they wanted to bring in the idea of universal voting and parliament and constitution and so forth .
And that &apos;s what happens to currencies when you don &apos;t stand behind them .
Now , think about where the world would be today if we had the light bulb , but you couldn &apos;t focus light ; if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to .
Dude , are you from Canada ? ( Laughter ) So , like , whatever , with Grand Theft Auto , you &apos;re this kid , like , you &apos;re this guy walking around or whatever , and you can basically , like , the more cops you kill , the more points you get , and stuff like that .
Sub-surface water on Mars , frozen in the form of ice .
The fundamental issue is that , for me , design is the first signal of human intentions .
That is a bit counterintuitive .
Were there things that weren &apos;t being done ?
The thing that was always striking to me was that we as people could have so many really amazing ideas about things we &apos;d like to do , but are so often unable , in the real world , to actually do those things — to actually cobble together the materials and go through the actual execution phase of building something that you imagine from a design perspective .
And I certainly don &apos;t know all the people who might be watching this talk over the Internet , somewhere in Buenos Aires or in New Delhi .
The good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually scale by strengthening civil society .
( Laughter ) We can build a better vine .
Columns are architectural archetypes .
So I thought , three words for one concept . This is not good .
We know looting is going on on a global scale and it &apos;s increasing , but presently we don &apos;t have any tools to stop it .
That &apos;s my mom .
And they will need chemistry . That &apos;s the point .
So , it &apos;s a normal-looking syringe .
The damage comes in the form of a double-strand break through the double helix .
And it &apos;s specifically algorithms , which are basically the math that computers use to decide stuff .

We collect four gigabits per second of data , if you can imagine that kind of data stream coming down .
At RISD , you &apos;re not allowed to draw from an image .
( Video ) Samantha Masters : That &apos;s what &apos;s up , man , this is a righteous man over here .
And this is how we come to care for the common good .
And it &apos;s looking up on the wooded heights of Washington Heights to Jeffrey &apos;s Hook , where the George Washington Bridge goes across today .
And then they talk , and then we pass the baton back and forth between each other .
The support may come in asking people questions , giving them a sheet of paper that has an organizational chart on it or has some guiding images , but we need to support it .
And I couldn &apos;t hear this sound .
And in that time they developed these subtle differences in the genetic architecture behind their blindness .
Also , I can imagine many design manufacturers will have to retool their own business plans and maybe invest in this Kinko &apos;s store . But it really is a big change .
You know , that &apos;s how you do science .
There was no one to comfort me .
They are hospital ships .
And that &apos;s a good thing to measure in M.S. , because patients with M.S. sadly suffer with problems with vision — loss of vision , unclear vision .
And who would want to tax one &apos;s son ?
( Laughter ) This formula works wherever metaphor is present .
But I also am in the fueling business .
And I &apos;ll just do that one more time .
Now , in non-tech speak , what that basically means is taking big , multi-year projects and breaking them up into bite-sized chunks , so that way we can reduce the risk and actually start to see results every couple of weeks , instead of waiting in a black box for years .
This jump up in energy in 2015 represented the best chance that we as a species had ever had of discovering new particles — new answers to these long-standing questions , because it was almost twice as much energy as we used when we discovered the Higgs boson .
You &apos;d be surprised to know that most of the girls that I have spoken to , who did not know about periods at the time of their first menstruation thought that they have got blood cancer and they &apos;re going to die soon .
What are my options ? What choices are now on the table ?
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
And they can pinch them very tight and stop it , or you can have them wide open .
This is a fundamental question that most of us are asking .

You know where I &apos;m going with that .
But there is one thing I know how to do : I know how to program a computer .
And just this past February , I won two back-to-back World Cup gold medals — ( Applause ) — which made me the highest ranked adaptive female snowboarder in the world .
As we know , only half the states have opted in .
So we threw in — we created a primordial soup with lots of pieces of robots — with bars , with motors , with neurons .
And fix it .
Reputation will be the currency that says that you can trust me .
No one in my family ever had joined the military at all , and how I first got introduced to the military was when I was 13 years old and I got sent away to military school , because my mother had been threatening me with this idea of military school ever since I was eight years old .
But this complement may be much inferior to what , with other laws and institutions , the nature of its soil , climate , and situation might admit of . &quot; &quot; That is so right and so cool .
Once you figure this out , you can really impress people at parties .
A hanger .
Even the most data-savvy companies get it wrong .
From a few bones , we infer the existence of dinosuars .
And I have four observations I &apos;d like to share with you today .

Working together is what changes our world .
In 1935 , there were 150,000 cases a year of malaria in the United States , but DDT and a massive public health effort managed to squelch it .
We &apos;ve been able to ensure better futures for the people and the bears .
And then I left .
There &apos;s a flip side as well .
But also , there seems to be a complete sort of gridlock in terms of solving these small solutions .
The only way out of poverty is through business enterprise .
We &apos;ve been more successful in the case of drug policy .
They &apos;re reconstructive .
Is it because women don &apos;t look like men , they don &apos;t look like that male-pattern heart disease that we &apos;ve spent the last 50 years understanding and getting really good diagnostics and really good therapeutics , and therefore , they &apos;re not recognized for their heart disease .
But go and look at what is in there .
And one of my favorite robots is Leonardo .
Kkhh !
We &apos;re 25 , 26 years after the advent of the Macintosh , which was an astoundingly seminal event in the history of human-machine interface and in computation in general .

I &apos;m not skiing along drawing maps ; everyone knows where the North Pole is .
And I thought to myself : What the hell have I done ?
I know you &apos;ve never heard of him , but just mark this day that someday you will hear of him , because he &apos;s really an amazing man . &quot; &quot; Frank Gehry : I heard he had some kind of a fling with Ingrid Bergman . Is that true ?
I was just always trying to make things .
And these meetings had this effect while taking under 20 minutes .

Cisgender means the gender I was assigned at birth is still and has always been female .
And it &apos;s fair to say that if we don &apos;t succeed , it &apos;s difficult to see who will .
Now that , I would say , is architecture performing .
In 1951 , Escher made this drawing . He thought he created an animal fantasy .
If you think 20 percent of genetic information in your nose is a lot of biological dark matter , if we looked at your gut , up to 40 or 50 percent of that information is biological dark matter .
All these choices involve value judgments and social norms , not objective facts .
And I &apos;m your mirror .
It goes into the soil , ending its journey in the lakes , resulting in lakes with extra phosphorus , which leads to the blue algae problem .
So my goal was to overcome the disadvantages of these current treatment methods and create a safe , sustainable , cost-effective and eco-friendly method of purifying water .
And then they would remember the first part of last century , which was really bad , and we could go by this so-called Great Leap Forward .
So I &apos;m here to tell you a story of success from Africa .
We could get them .
So the metaphor I &apos;d like the use I can take from a story of a great idea that &apos;s quite recent — a lot more recent than the 1650s .
It was also people &apos;s deep longing for freedom .
I &apos;m going to begin by reciting a poem .
But he was also in Oxford in the &apos; 50s , and yet growing up as a child in Nigeria , my father used to say to me , &quot; &quot; You must never eat or drink in a Yoruba person &apos;s house because they will poison you . &quot; &quot; It makes sense now when I think about it , because if you &apos;d known my father , you would &apos;ve wanted to poison him too .
We wanted to do something now .
We also heard that 250 billion Indian rupees was dedicated for government schooling .
I didn &apos;t expect that person that I was going to meet to be him .
JS : God knows .
This raises the very real possibility of anonymous war .
The best chess players spend a lot of time not playing games of chess , which would be their performance zone , but trying to predict the moves grand masters made and analyzing them .

How many children did you have ?
Does evolution control the sophistication of matter in the universe ?
I &apos;m in something big , bad and ugly .
And while the hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological dark matter are really only in their infancy , there &apos;s a very , very exciting possibility that exists : that buried in this life , in this genetic information , are signatures of as of yet unidentified life .
But why ?
This solution was initially designed for the Chinese market , but now it &apos;s selling like hotcakes in the U.S. and Europe , where hospitals are pressured to deliver quality care at lower cost .

So the adoption papers were signed .
There are the lunch ladies in Kentucky who realized that 67 percent of their students relied on those meals every day , and they were going without food over the summer , so they retrofitted a school bus to create a mobile feeding unit , and they traveled around the neighborhoods feedings 500 kids a day during the summer .
Now , creative works may indeed be kind of like property , but it &apos;s property that we &apos;re all building on , and creations can only take root and grow once that ground has been prepared .
But if you think about it , if you have a lily pad and it just divided every single day — two , four , eight , 16 — in 15 days you have 32,000 .
And so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in , we can do that .
And if we want to cure ourselves of NDD , or Nature Deficit Disorder , I think this is a great way of doing it .
Basically , we tribalize , and that process of unifying feels so good and is so good for us , that it even helps people who are struggling with mental health issues .
I was so lucky to watch the change of that South Africa into the new South Africa as I went year by year .
That is a &quot; &quot; Who is Who &quot; &quot; list .
But I think I get to come back to this , because imagine having a compact reactor in a rocket that produces 50 to 100 megawatts .
I was more concerned with touching the screen on my Apple than actually feeding him one .
and an iPad .
Actually , I read this great quote the other day , which was , &quot; Style makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you &apos;re going to die . &quot;

The majority of our functional brain is distributed over the outer surface layer of the brain , and to increase the area that &apos;s available for mental capacity , the brain surface is highly folded .
Warren Berger says that design thinking teaches us to look sideways , to reframe , to refine , to experiment and , probably most importantly , ask those stupid questions .

And that urbanization is extraordinary , accelerated pace .
Here we are . Unfortunately , I can &apos;t show you a picture of this symmetrical object .
And the third is the focusing illusion , and it &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about any circumstance that affects well-being without distorting its importance .
I want to talk to you about one of the biggest myths in medicine , and that is the idea that all we need are more medical breakthroughs and then all of our problems will be solved .
This is a real challenge to do this , because animals , when you start to really look inside them — how they work — appear hopelessly complex . There &apos;s no detailed history of the design plans , you can &apos;t go look it up anywhere .
This is probably a fairly small piece of Mathematica code that &apos;s able to be run here .

Because of the speed and brevity of social media , we are forced to jump to conclusions and write sharp opinions in 140 characters about complex world affairs .
And here &apos;s the thing that you need to get comfortable with when you &apos;ve given the tool to acquire information to students , is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process .
In the past , different students were taught in similar ways .
So now I want to take you to the moment of — When you &apos;re an entrepreneur , and you &apos;ve started a new company , there &apos;s the , here &apos;s all the stuff we do beforehand , and then the service launches . What happens ?

So , a moment .
If there was a dial tone and you dialed a number , the odds were two in three you wouldn &apos;t get the number you were intending to reach .
He is not a political man , but in this guise he has given us the institution for democracy , from where we can rise .
That &apos;s 40 billion dollars a year wasted on electricity that does not contribute to our well-being but does contribute to climate change .
We &apos;ll see what I come up with . Thanks for having me .
So there really was no tolerable margin of error .
This is the opposite of what we were built on : independence , self-sufficiency , autonomy .
And as the student video showed , we can impact and move .
You know , you guys are so great , you don &apos;t even know what a connectome is , and you &apos;re willing to play along with me .

When those extra three billion people &apos;s identity is mobile , it isn &apos;t fixed ?
The chimps are actually interacting with each other through the computers .

I &apos;m not an anthropologist , I have no technical study with the subject , but I do have a very , very , very deep passion , and I believe that I had to choose the most beautiful people on the planet in the most beautiful environment that they lived in , and put the two together and present them to you .
Audience : Yes .
My sweet angels , come back . &quot; &quot; Medea she was , next time I saw her .

It wasn &apos;t simple to work in such environments , sometimes having pigs under you while you paint or climbing a stack of garbage to reach a lift .
It was practically everybody .
So the concept here : so if you do have a deceased or injured organ , we take a very small piece of that tissue , less than half the size of a postage stamp .
Because most of you compared the price of this Big Mac to the price you &apos;re used to paying . Rather than asking , &quot; &quot; What else can I do with my money , &quot; &quot; comparing this investment to other possible investments , you compared to the past .

In recent years , because of global warming , they now cover about 10 percent — an increase by a factor of 25 to 50 .
These are just a few of the ideas that are to die for .
Some of them show greater variability .
And they need to think about the substance of their agreement much more than about the labels they want to attach to them .
So the question is , so , why are they all standing there holding books ?
But the religious world doesn &apos;t think that way .

Nuclear — there are two bars here .
One of the ranches is called the Kirkeby Ranch , and I &apos;ll take you there for a minute .
So clearly there was a problem with deforestation .
And that &apos;s the way , ultimately after some ups and downs , I ended up designing the chair I &apos;m going to show you .
Well , they signed me up immediately .
My ideal world is a place where no one is left behind , where everyone is needed exactly where they are , like the fibers and the tendons in a bow , a place where the strong is flexible and the vulnerable is resilient .

Your phone is not very natural .
Even if you don &apos;t want to , it &apos;s very difficult numerically .

This is a tapir .
And unlike the juicy salif , it does not threaten to attach itself to your brain , rather , it simply attaches itself to your brain .
And here &apos;s another example of that interesting cross-pollination between science and art .

We wash the bug out .
HK : I take it as a good sign , because people feel secure in this democracy .
Well , at that time — I should go back .
And that ability to get others to want what you want , to get the outcomes you want without coercion or payment , is what I call soft power .
Other conditions show people the future self .
( Laughter ) Man : Your father , is he alive ?
Additional experiments are going on in other animals that are useful for creating models for human disease , such as monkeys .

The last 20 years has been the age of intervention , and Afghanistan is simply one act in a five-act tragedy .
It &apos;s to have a look at different worlds .
It &apos;s really good . It starts with &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; and goes to &quot; &quot; aw . &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; is high , the &quot; &quot; aw &quot; &quot; is low .
Because of data .
Here &apos;s another example .
I &apos;ve been lucky enough to answer some of these questions as I &apos;ve explored this nocturnal world .
So figuring out all these relationships with relative and absolute location , distance , timing , velocities — that &apos;s really the key to the science of moving dots , or as we like to call it , spatiotemporal pattern recognition , in academic vernacular .
It should not be . Until one of my colleagues said , &quot; &quot; It looks to me like a thermal blister , and the mid-ocean ridge must be a cooling curve . &quot; &quot; We said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s go find out . &quot; &quot; We punched a bunch of heat probes . Everything made sense , except , at the axis , there was missing heat . It was missing heat .
Well , more idea creators .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Brought in more women .
But this , I show you , when kids from the poorest congressional district in America can build a 30-foot by 15-foot wall , design it , plant it and install it in the heart of New York City , that &apos;s a true &quot; &quot; sí se puede &quot; &quot; moment .

Where does it stop ?
( Applause )
I &apos;ve been eating cereal for breakfast all of my life .
So low income here , high income there .
It &apos;s the autobiographical self which some species have , I think .

That was the question we wanted to know , so my colleagues and I decided to take a deep dive into the data .
Anyway , I felt that it was important that you didn &apos;t have to make an adjustment in order to get this kind of action .
They blamed the leader of the opposition for not fighting it hard enough .
Now it &apos;s a little bit less than 30 percent .
And so , she really just completely ignored me most of the time .
And I &apos;m working at all the energy I have to sort of communicate this message that we need preschool , we need Head Start , we need prenatal care .
( Laughter ) KA : By being totally surprising and humorous , Casey Niestat got his funny idea and point seen five million times .
Well , it &apos;s not going to come as any surprise for me to tell you that banks accept dirty money , but they prioritize their profits in other destructive ways too .

But I did come to embrace this new identity , and in many ways I think of myself now as African .
And the technology we have developed — it &apos;s called SIM OFDM .

What are they going to think when we actually form a colony on Mars ?
It &apos;s true .
The more output you churn out , the more variety you get and the better your chances of stumbling on something truly original .
All of this is a variation of the if-then model .
And I believe that magic and puzzles are the same because they both key into one of the most important human drives : the urge to solve .

Now , already in the case of the brain disorders that I &apos;ve been talking to you about , depression , obsessive compulsive disorder , post-traumatic stress disorder , while we don &apos;t have an in-depth understanding of how they are abnormally processed or what the brain is doing in these illnesses , we have been able to already identify some of the connectional differences , or some of the ways in which the circuitry is different for people who have these disorders .
A lot of urban areas have been converted into parking lots in a sort of indiscriminate use .
To be able to change fences and window guards into flowers , it &apos;s fantastic .
So these all have the property of self-similarity : the part looks like the whole .

Now , it turns out that the more egalitarian our relationships , the happier both partners are .
It &apos;s analyzing trends . It &apos;s predicting the future .
It &apos;s quite hard , actually , to get those very small changes .
I don &apos;t need to know that at the end of the year when it &apos;s too late .

So , visualizing information can give us a very quick solution to those kinds of problems .
We &apos;re going to do that very soon .
( Laughter ) Now it &apos;s just the way it is .
So that &apos;s where we are today , and that &apos;s what I wanted to give you a flavor of .

So she &apos;s even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn &apos;t stupid , even though she thought she could look stupid .
We &apos;re not the only ones .
This is the result of my hobby , which is unofficial bin inspections .

They &apos;re not very animated . ( Laughter ) This was the fourth take , I &apos;m told . ( Laughter ) Okay . So , as we &apos;re talking about Cambridge , let &apos;s now move on to technical advancements , because since we started putting this technology on mobile phones less than 12 months ago , the speed and the processing in these devices has grown at a really phenomenal rate , and that means that I can now take cinema-quality 3D models and place them in the world around me , so I have one over here .
So breaking things back down and delivering smartly , elegantly , sophisticated solutions that take into consideration the entire system and the entire life of the thing , everything , all the way back to the extraction through to the end of life , we can start to actually find really innovative solutions .

Wonderful as they are , I believe the time has come for us to complement these bulky electronic giants with what nature has already invented : the microbe , a single-celled organism that is itself a self-generating , self-replenishing , living machine .
But the point is , by constantly depicting the state part as necessary but actually — pffff — a bit boring and often a bit dangerous kind of Leviathan , I think we &apos;ve actually really stunted the possibility to build these public-private partnerships in a really dynamic way .

When this story was published in the Washington Post , I started receiving death threats , and I was forced to leave Afghanistan , as my parents were .

And so , as we evaluated , and as the dust settled from this tragedy , we realized that , of those two problems — in the initial iteration of our organization , we were a disaster response organization that was using veteran service .

And every culture comes up with its own understanding of life , its own customized version of mythology .
The doorbell rang and it was a trick-or-treater dressed as my character . It was so cool .

Now hold your breath , not too long , to imagine what comes next .
I &apos;d say , watch any successful well-written , family-friendly sitcom in the West for your answers .

And I think we can go and use our technology to go and digitize things , put them on the Net , and then download , print them and bind them , and end up with books again .
Any event that happens anywhere in the world , I should be able to know about it pretty much instantaneously , as it happens , for free .
And how much will they pay for this ?

All right ? Anybody else like that , no ?
That &apos;s it , thank you .
100 years later .
I can &apos;t tell you when this will start , because I don &apos;t want my competition to know my schedule .
So the oyster was the basis for a manifesto-like urban design project that I did about the New York Harbor called &quot; &quot; oyster-tecture . &quot; &quot; And the core idea of oyster-tecture is to harness the biological power of mussels , eelgrass and oysters — species that live in the harbor — and , at the same time , harness the power of people who live in the community towards making change now .
Like one of the ways to understand our greenhouse future is to drill down in time to the last period where we had CO2 double what it is today .
He &apos;s not quite a child , and he &apos;s not quite a man .
That &apos;s a very powerful idea , and it &apos;s a very powerful reality .

But along with the scientific challenge and the economic challenge , there &apos;s also a cultural challenge , and this is probably the part about malaria that people don &apos;t like to talk about .
So what is happening ?
Right around D-Day , Bonica showed up to Madigan Army Medical Center , near Tacoma .
Here &apos;s the mystery , then : How do we actually make these polymer chains inside the brain so we can move all the biomolecules apart ?

You can see on the pottery and the baskets .
We didn &apos;t — a lot of flying , a lot of experiments , a lot of things that didn &apos;t work , and ones that did work , and the plane kept getting a little better , a little better .
And I love my country , and I &apos;m not going to fail that . I &apos;m not going to fail that .
So let me just end with a couple of scenarios .
It &apos;s a start .
Whoosh . Okay .
Here &apos;s Koko with her kitten .

Or worse , about to sue them . And so I went through — ( Laughter ) Right ? I went through my entire business career , and never spoke about being a woman , never spoke about it publicly .
But as early as 1968 , this visionary man , Robert Kennedy , at the start of his ill-fated presidential campaign , gave the most eloquent deconstruction of gross national product that ever has been .
It &apos;s also the great theoretical triumph of biology .
But this time , I was the patient .
And this work corrects that bias in our culture , that dehumanizing bias .
A single cave system , like Mammoth Cave , which is in Kentucky , can be as long as more than 600 kilometers .
Mahmood Ali Balogun : I think filmmaking in Nigeria , for those who work in it , is a kind of subsistence filmmaking — what they do to make a living .

Apparently I did . &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m his old girlfriend , Maureen Stapleton , and I could never do it . &quot; &quot; And then she made me go up with the tape of it and prove that George Abbott actually could talk .
He wrote that , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radical acts like the brain of one of the lower animals . &quot; &quot; This is not a metaphor .

They &apos;ve funded research that shows that we can double global palm oil production without cutting a single tree in the next 20 years , and do it all in Borneo alone by planting on land that &apos;s already degraded .
We can track these changes , and have tracked these changes in many such behaviors across time .
So , clearly , we were in a substantially better place for this .
They &apos;re probably going to be angry , depressed , frustrated .
And one of the things I really like about gardening is that it doesn &apos;t take all your concentration , you really can &apos;t get hurt — it &apos;s not like woodworking — and you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation .
And here &apos;s what I found : most people are worrying about the wrong thing .

I &apos;m watching who &apos;s watching me .
You know , the Spanish didn &apos;t sink the battleship Maine , the Lusitania was not an innocent vessel but was loaded with munitions , the North Vietnamese did not attack the Seventh Fleet , and , of course , Saddam Hussein hated al Qaeda and had nothing to do with it , and yet the administration convinced 45 percent of the people that they were brothers in arms , when he would hang one from the nearest lamppost .
And when I came back , I had to give them a lot of gratitude and praise because they showed me that they truly had my back and that they truly had their own backs .

We could test the safety of chemicals that we are exposed to on a daily basis in our environment , such as chemicals in regular household cleaners .
The first thought is that , hey , you know there &apos;s somebody somewhere out there playing some music , and this is a small but I think important human connection to make that perhaps the technology affords .
Would you describe that as global citizenship ?
Taiwan succeeded , China under Mao Zedong didn &apos;t .
Here are three sets of firing patterns . The top one is from a normal animal , the middle one is from a blind animal that &apos;s been treated with this encoder-transducer device , and the bottom one is from a blind animal treated with a standard prosthetic .
Here &apos;s another one : &quot; &quot; Sorry I didn &apos;t respond to you earlier .
And so I asked Jawad , &quot; &quot; How do you guys navigate ? This is a really diverse community .
Is this just an interesting mathematical structure that might be able to explain some previously unexplained features of the world , or can we actually test for these extra dimensions ?
Or languages have different word orders .
What did we want from each other ?

The problem is that we have these color-tinted glasses as we look at all kinds of situations .
Thank you .
And as adults , we &apos;re certainly not alone .
I believe at this time we need a moratorium .

If not , well , this is the hardest problem perhaps in science and philosophy .
It listens to the lecture , and then it uses the amplitude of each word to move a point on the x-axis , and it uses the inflection of sentences to move a same point up and down on the y-axis .
Transistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen , and technology has really benefitted from that .
If you want to change the world , you have to group together , you have to be collaborative .

This little thing says here : five times what NASA &apos;s doing by 2020 . I want to tell you , already there &apos;s about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion investment in private space flight that is not government at all — already , worldwide .

Hey , that &apos;s pretty big .
We can easily resign to the fact or to the thinking that government is too inefficient , too corrupt , unfixable .
Nearly everything that we do , even the most mundane thing , uses nearly all of our brains .
This cross between robotics and things like terrorism is going to be fascinating and even disturbing , and we &apos;ve already seen it start .

We require warrants to be based on probable cause or some kind of individualized suspicion because we recognize that trusting anybody , any government authority , with the entirety of human communications in secret and without oversight is simply too great a temptation to be ignored .
CA : So , we &apos;ve got a picture , I think ? Where is this ?

In 1980 , the top one percent of Americans shared about eight percent of national &#91; income &#93; , while the bottom 50 percent of Americans shared 18 percent .
So luckily , the science — no , sorry — the marketing is getting easier .
Well , after years of working toward a climate agreement , the same governments convened in Copenhagen and failed miserably .
It &apos;s just because people are uncomfortable with the idea , and that &apos;s why I want you today to try to think about this , think about the benefits of bees in cities and why they really are a terrific thing .
That &apos;s kind of too much effort .
RW : Hmmm .
Bad Guy : Good morning .

It turns out , when you add mobility — the ability to roll around the table — you get a little more of a boost .
So if you take , say , natural gas , which is the most prevalent hydrocarbon source fuel , if you burn that in a modern General Electric natural gas turbine , you &apos;ll get about 60 percent efficiency .
And this problem is : where are the plants ?
It evolves .
It &apos;s a very holistic way of improving the lives of the people living in the villages around the park .

Of course , there are the bases , which refer to specific sexual activities that happen in a very specific order , ultimately resulting in scoring a run or hitting a home run , which is usually having vaginal intercourse to the point of orgasm , at least for the guy .
So as a great physicist once said , there &apos;s these little upstream eddies of biology that create order in this rapid torrent of entropy .
People look at the roads , for example , and they &apos;d say , &quot; Angola : 90 percent of roads are untarred . Ah , problem ! &quot;
This is Sea-Monkeys .
Uncontacted peoples hold a mystical and iconic role in our imagination .

These are survival skills .
And indeed , I think , rather than being annihilated , the performing arts are poised on the brink of a time when we will be more important than we have ever been .
Now , we &apos;re all here to dream , but maybe if we &apos;re honest about it , each of us chasing our own dream .

Well , ultimately , it could mean that you could print your own medicine .
It was , what I would say , compositional complexity , and I felt that if I had to fulfill what I talked about — a building for science — there had to be some kind of a generating idea , some kind of a generating geometry .
They said , we won &apos;t think about it until we know it &apos;s right .
RB : Philippe is quite erratic , so I think that he wouldn &apos;t be the best person to design the engine , no .

And if you &apos;re in the half-mile radius of where this bomb went off , you have a 90 percent chance of not making it .
And when I started out , I was just using these blue duct-tape filters over my strobe , so I could make sure I &apos;m actually seeing the light that &apos;s being transformed by the animals .
We need more than that . Where do we draw the line ?
Some of us have a burglar alarm system at home , and some of us don &apos;t .
He saw that first glint of light — he knew what the weather was going to be three days from now .
We might even call them citizens , because they &apos;ve recently risen up to fight against legislative incursion , and the citizens of these networks work together to serve each other in great ways .
A plant , quite simply , needs light , it needs CO2 , but even more importantly , it needs nutrients , which it draws from the soil .
I remember one day , it was a very hot day in the spring , and we hadn &apos;t been in a fight in a couple of weeks , maybe .
Obviously that doesn &apos;t work very well for — CA : What just happened there ? We just saw something land ?
They hatched out in India .
So what we need is space inside the aircraft , inside a very dense area .
Now , would that this were just about Sarah Palin and her reality TV show .
And I learned a new word last week .

Make a decision and give me some blood .
I don &apos;t want him killed . I know he &apos;s going to love cliffs .
And her voice was the most powerful voice .
Yeah . Jack — you &#91; unclear &#93; with Jack ? Jack
But as I sat there for four hours , the full afternoon , reading Maslow , I recognized something that is true of most leaders .
Because , you know , most people , when they hear that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more , they think that I &apos;m saying that we &apos;re going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more .
You know about objects and their properties .
Where do you see your doctor and your dentist ? &quot; &quot; then I &apos;m very much of the United States , and I have been for 48 years now , since I was a really small child .
But a lot of times , whole categories of innovation — ones that can help us live more beautifully — turn out to be illegal .
They wouldn &apos;t go listen to him .
No democracy anywhere in the world offers this feature to its citizens for either legislation or for budgets , even though those are the things done with our consent and with our money .

Howard is not so easily placated .

So the first time I worked with colors was by making these mosaics of Pantone swatches .
When I went to sleep , the next day it wasn &apos;t there .
If you want to add to this picture and try and sketch it globally , you really have to force yourself to go down to the four corners of the Earth — Africa , India , Antarctica , Australia — and start putting together some of these pieces .
So John &apos;s now 18 months further down in that journey , and I &apos;ve now asked him to tell us something about his current predicament .

Why couldn &apos;t Masa have taken an airplane to Sweden ?
We &apos;d actually — ( Laughter ) it would be harder . It would take — Take 2 would be a bitch .
( Applause )
I believe we can connect every school in Ethiopia , every health clinic , every hospital — we can connect to the Internet .
You should be nice to nerds .
Getting to school , for a kid that was actually pretty short for his age , through the Canadian winter , was not a pleasant experience .
MT : Sorry . Now , one way of persuading humans that robots are safe is to create the illusion of trust .
The flashlight gives us this really intense , bright L.E.D. , and six hours worth of rechargeable battery pack , and the lunch box is a nice little package in which you can put everything inside , and a bunch of mini speakers to sort of amplify the sound large enough .
This bias and systematic lack of engagement of indigenous people in both clinical trials and genome studies is partially the result of a history of distrust .
So , sometimes , Wolfram Alpha will be able to do the whole thing immediately and just give back a whole big program that you can then compute with .
Thanks .
I used to be a fan of Bach .
They are a kind of social capital .
( Laughter ) And so , to me , I wanted more value in this , so when she asked if she could play a game , I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so I happened to have all of these little pieces .
You see the canal they dug ?
I went to teach seventh graders math in the New York City public schools .
And that is , to me , the sign of a masterpiece , of a painting when there &apos;s a lack of resolution .
So we won &apos;t give the rest of the code , but we will give the three quotations .
And the question is , should we run them or not ?
You can &apos;t be a feminist who &apos;s also interested in fashion .
The future research is &quot; &quot; How can we find the genetic and molecular markers for the viability of seeds , without having to plant them every 10 years ? &quot; &quot; And we &apos;re almost there .
So unfortunately , this orphan spends most of his time in storage , along with quite a number of other orphans , some of them some beautiful paintings .
This was a golden age of bipartisanship , at least in terms of the parties &apos; ability to work together and solve grand national problems .

We then use optical sorting to color sort this material .
And I will be in your corner for the rest of your life . &quot; &quot; For me , that is the power of girls .
Finally , this is a 26-year-old nun I spoke to .
It &apos;s our own pond . And that &apos;s how it happens . &quot; &quot; And she goes , &quot; &quot; Then how do they get fertilized ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , Men , through their penis , they fertilize the eggs by the sperm coming out .
Toxic waste , I guess , is the key clue to that one .
It craves stories of success in dealing with complex issues , especially in developing countries .
The Ashaninka people are known throughout South America for their dignity , their spirit and their resistance , starting with the Incas and continuing through the 19th century with the rubber tappers .
And then there is social media , and what &apos;s happening on the Internet .
And it feels just incredibly cool to do that .
But what I &apos;m saying here is that we can make a difference and we can do that by investing .
There are hundreds of them all over the earth , but in this country , James Van Praagh is very big .
We &apos;ve got to confront that reality .
They accompany me wherever I go in my life , and I fill them with all sorts of things , records of my lived experience : so watercolor paintings , drawings of what I see , dead flowers , dead insects , pasted ticket stubs , rusting coins , business cards , writings .
So I should say , I guess , that since the time of that original President Johnson report , and the various reports of the U.S. National Academy — 1977 , 1982 , 1990 — people always talked about this idea .
That hit a wall . They couldn &apos;t shrink them and keep the vacuum .

The hospital put him on a water drip for three days .
It took me several months to design the column , but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces .
There &apos;s lots of room , so people can come up and understand what it is before they get involved .
So I want to tell you about someone like this that I know .
Think of this as a form of edited biology .
We &apos;ll go over to Jacques Tati here and grab our blue friend and put him down on the table as well .
There she is .

Whether it &apos;s a &quot; &quot; Floral Fusion &quot; &quot; or a &quot; &quot; Paradise Winds , &quot; &quot; they &apos;ll have their chance .

This is hitting the reservoirs .
On Twitter that night , we were like toddlers crawling towards a gun .
Well real organized crime on the Internet goes back about 10 years when a group of gifted Ukrainian hackers developed a website , which led to the industrialization of cybercrime .

And when you &apos;re hungry , food becomes more attractive , and so forth .
It &apos;s their right to fight . &quot; &quot; Now as you know , Mandela didn &apos;t do that .

This work , which was published in &quot; &quot; Nature , &quot; &quot; late 2009 , after a number of years of analysis , led to the final proposition that we can only find nine planetary boundaries with which , under active stewardship , would allow ourselves to have a safe operating space .
AK : Wow , a hundred million miles away . This is crazy !
We just dismiss it out of our consciousness .
Here &apos;s the first easy problem : You can have 60 dollars now or 50 dollars now . Which would you prefer ?
So imagine , if you as a high school can have the satellite for a week and do satellite space experiments like that .
Those were the achievements of our great regime .
You see , we tend to think the problem is solved when we solve the technology problem .
So why is that happening ?
So listening to this brought something to the ear besides the obvious burst .
One is in India , where there are 240 million farmers , most of whom make less than two dollars a day .
And this routine went on for some time .

And if I can get the camera — okay , great — you &apos;ll see , as I get sort of close ...
In fact , I view the two forces as fusing together into what I call &quot; &quot; connectography . &quot; &quot; Connectography represents a quantum leap in the mobility of people , resources and ideas , but it is an evolution , an evolution of the world from political geography , which is how we legally divide the world , to functional geography , which is how we actually use the world , from nations and borders , to infrastructure and supply chains .

Tell us briefly about that and your role in that .
It is very scary to go through that feeling of &quot; &quot; I am about to die &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; I could die in this explosion . &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s also the fear of losing loved ones , and I think that &apos;s even worse .
And this turns out to be useful .
Second of all , the court doubled down on this exclusion by making it legally inconsequential .
Let &apos;s talk about billions . Let &apos;s talk about
Being criminalized leaves you exposed to mistreatment by the state itself .
And you know , it &apos;s just one of the great things about being a musician , is that it is so unbelievably fluid .
It means &quot; &quot; I have enough . &quot; &quot; And that is utterly true .
The concept that they &apos;re working towards — and they have working prototypes — is that we placed it throughout the motor points of the body where they &apos;re needed .
So my freshman year of college I signed up for an internship in the housing unit at Greater Boston Legal Services .
It &apos;s not a lot of money at the global level .
Tolerance is not really a lived virtue ; it &apos;s more of a cerebral ascent .
And as far as isolation goes , when we as a species do colonize distant planets , there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way .

It &apos;s really hard , but in essence , nerves from the brain go up into the nose and on these nerves exposed in the nose to the outside air are receptors , and odor molecules coming in on a sniff interact with these receptors , and if they bond , they send the nerve a signal which goes back into the brain .
And some of the largest projects in the country were being constructed through government-to-government arrangements with some of the leading countries in the world , the United States and Britain and France and so on and so on .
Three weeks later , I was healed , and I was back in high school .
Ying solved this problem by insisting that all bows and arrows were designed identically , so they were interchangeable .
Virtually all of you could , right ?

So this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing at least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye .
With the siege on Gaza , tunnels brought people all the basic needs like food , building material , other stuff we needed .
And before long , I was commuting between Budapest , Milan and Florence .
You know what today &apos;s leadership is doing ? Concave length .

You can make a biocensor out of yeast to detect pollutants in water .
Alpha is the distribution of the sizes of attacks , which is really the distribution of the group strength carrying out the attacks .
And quite often we sit in a design meeting and we discover that there is this great idea .
And it is an awesome thing to be a part of empowering someone in this way .

So you can look at that piece , but you can look at the other pieces too .
When we first put the mouse into this box , it &apos;s exploring , sniffing around , walking around , minding its own business , because actually by nature , mice are pretty curious animals .
Now , all of the women , or most of the women in Vermeer &apos;s other paintings wore velvet , silk , fur , very sumptuous materials .
But I think that it &apos;s quite interesting to know that there is really mathematical evidence to say that you should never let the sun go down on your anger .
There is jeopardy , and of course , the closer you get , it gets harder .
But they have other communication signals they use .
And here is the fruition of that in actuality .
And Michael Fleischman was another Ph.D. student in my lab who worked with me on this home video analysis , and he made the following observation : that &quot; &quot; just the way that we &apos;re analyzing how language connects to events which provide common ground for language , that same idea we can take out of your home , Deb , and we can apply it to the world of public media . &quot; &quot; And so our effort took an unexpected turn .
For the most basic , most common , most frustrating part of being a patient .
It ’ s a neural system that ’ s wired up to reward the brain for doing a grubby clerical job .

Once upon a time there &apos;s this happy little bacterium .
And then we stuck them under the steps .
I still had migraine headaches .
Government institutions were completely decapitated , including the presidential palace .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s really cool .
And I thought up a lot of ideas .
And my daughter — oh , surely she is extra-intelligent . &quot; &quot; And so on . So I suddenly figured that , how come all the rich people are having these extraordinarily gifted children ?
And I think it &apos;s because of what I &apos;m hearing today in TED talks .
It is to explain death to a child , and it deserves a piece of plain-song music . &quot; &quot; And my blood froze when I read that because I had written the plain-song music 130 years after he &apos;d written the letter .
If you do this , you surely will hit somewhere near the center .
And then when I got home , I sat down and I set myself to task to really try to create something just completely outside of the box .
And we lobbied on behalf of women &apos;s issues .
At DEC , I worked on software for the new area of computerized typesetting .
And we &apos;ve seen that repeatedly through this conference , not just this year , but in past years .
So at the age of 14 my father had to work .
And the one thing I &apos;d like to point out here is that we &apos;ve done this before .
If they could do it for them , surely they could do it for me .
Several scientific studies have shown that abnormal microRNA expression levels varies and creates a unique , specific pattern for each type of cancer , even at the early stages , reflecting the progression of the disease , and whether it &apos;s responding to medication or in remission , making microRNAs a perfect , highly sensitive biomarker .

In Germany , scientists are starting to find evidence of autoimmunity , and in Japan , of brain inflammation .
China &apos;s highest ruling body , the Politburo , has 25 members .
But the most important thing we must do is , I think , we must all walk to the end of our lives and turn around , and ask ourselves a most fundamental question .
These ideas probably remind you of &quot; &quot; Total Recall , &quot; &quot; &quot; Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , &quot; or of &quot; &quot; Inception . &quot; &quot; But the movie stars that we work with are the celebrities of the lab .
But it was interesting because I had some very preconceived notions about , for instance , evangelical Christianity , and I found that it &apos;s such a wide and varied movement that it is difficult to make generalizations about it .
From astronauts &apos; experiences in space , we know that spending time in a microgravity environment means bone loss , muscle atrophy , cardiovascular problems , among many other complications that range for the physiological to the psychological .
So in other words , while our vascular system uses the three dimensions inside us , our urban transportation is mostly two-dimensional .
So I &apos;m on a mission to change that .
The first day they all came back .

The monarch butterfly could be one of the 20 to 50 percent of all species that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates will be ticketed for extinction by the end of the century if we stay on business-as-usual fossil fuel use .
But in the mean time , I &apos;m going to call on the worldwide education expert , who &apos;s my 10-year-old daughter , Noa , to talk to you about why the boys in her class do worse .
Which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice overload problem , which is concretization .
Does it have to take a tragedy or a disaster for us to feel deeply connected as one species , as human beings ?
You were sleeping during that class .
Who decides what reality is ?
And when the resources came , be it oil , we started building these fancy technologies and bringing people together because we needed the concentration .
Then I ran 50 miles — ultramarathons .
Another called MaidSafe works on similar principles .
And she does really good business . In fact , I watched her walk through the streets hawking . And before you knew it , there was a crowd of women around her , buying these dresses .
On the top , now , that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through — the dotted line , the temperatures .

I was a young Australian woman doing extraordinary things in London .
And I realized that , when I &apos;d left the country , free and fair elections in a democratic environment were a dream .
So the best place for x-ray crystallography was at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge .
We might not ever know .
Oh , look how it lies there .
MM : The medium does things to people and they are always completely unaware of this .
Shit offends people . Feces is too medical .
So , how do they do that ?
What they &apos;ve done is they &apos;ve shifted their operations .
Thank you .
Interestingly enough , an example : One young man who earned a C in the first course and wanted to go on to med school , we said , &quot; &quot; We need to have you retake the course , because you need a strong foundation if you &apos;re going to move to the next level . &quot; &quot; Every foundation makes the difference in the next level .

Children don &apos;t like it .
And then Leilei — I know his other name — told us about interconnection , and how we &apos;re all totally interconnected here , and how we &apos;ve all known each other .

But the effect is relatively small .
So that &apos;s why the petitioner , the victims , the peasants , want to take the train to Beijing to petition to the central government , they want the emperor to settle the problem .

Be a mentor .
ES : I can see you . ( Laughter ) CA : And who goes with the second choice , the fundamentally heroic act ?
When I enter into dialogue , I really hope that the other side would pick up my points of view , that I would impress upon them my opinions and my values .
So you imagine , if we &apos;re able to create a self-sustaining artificial life form , not only will this tell us about the origin of life — that it &apos;s possible that the universe doesn &apos;t need carbon to be alive ; it can use anything — we can then take &#91; it &#93; one step further and develop new technologies , because we can then use software control for evolution to code in .
Now if I graph , for instance , some other technology , say transportation technology , on a semi-log curve , it would look very stupid , it would look like a flat line .
You can make objective claims about a domain that is subjective in its mode of existence , and indeed that &apos;s what neurologists do .
So nowadays in the operating room , we no longer need to use sunlight .
When you actually look at the motor of the world economy , it cannot move forward unless there is trade between the different countries .

Only months later , I discover who he really was .
There &apos;s other ways of making flaps .
Richard Dawkins : &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve evolved around courtship and sex , are attached to deep-rooted emotions and reactions that are hard to jettison overnight . &quot; &quot; David Pizarro : So my favorite part of this clip is that Professor Dawkins actually gagged .
After a while , I got a bit — I wanted to go somewhere else .
I am going to tell you how I do it and the most important thing I &apos;ve learned .
I have no idea how that works . We &apos;ll send that over there .
With those three systems , you have what is always necessary — a level of redundancy that says , if one system fails , you &apos;ll still have a way to make sure that you &apos;re being controlled .
And the very best of luck to you .
And as the sandstone weathers , new grains break free .
but he experiences himself , his thoughts and feelings , as something separate from the rest ...
But some of you might not know that the arm itself can actually regenerate a complete starfish .
We got a survey done on medical conditions with people who have similar issues , and I look at medical records , and I say , wouldn &apos;t it be amazing if everyone &apos;s medical records were available anonymously to research doctors ?
The year is 2005 .
Somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles .
The world that meant a lot to me , I saw it vanish in my face .
Kallikuppam had caught up with my control school in New Delhi , a rich private school with a trained biotechnology teacher .
He was a very selfish meme .
On average , there &apos;s one within 20 to 30 miles of wherever you are in the United States .
The employment in the rich countries will go down from about 800 to about 700 million of these people .
But in order to try and explain the whole thing , I would need another 18 minutes or so to do it , so you &apos;re just going to have to take it on trust from me on this occasion , and let me assure you that all of these issues are involved in cybersecurity and control of the Internet one way or the other , but in a configuration that even Stephen Hawking would probably have difficulty trying to get his head around .
Now if we look forward a bit to the 19th century , we find a new style of technology .
( Laughter ) Voice : Look at my smile .
She still made the two-hour trek to the schoolhouse and tried to catch every little bit of information that seeped out of the doors .
Pope Francis , who has made such a difference to this whole issue , visited Tacloban right after that .

The government recently announced plans to return to the moon by 2024 .
And so immediately as you meet people , you shake their hand , and then your eyes go to their shoulder , because you want to see where did they serve , or what unit did they serve with ?
I met humble people .
Now , I get to the final thing , which is the set of which my name is attached .
The second stage was completed at the Penn State University main campus lab , which is where I extracted the chemicals , changed the PH so I could run it through the equipment and separated the compounds I needed from the rest of the chicken .
And then when Rockefeller Center said , NBC , could you put this thing up on the walls ? We were delighted .

And , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time .
( Laughter ) This was a fun one .
Those are their expectations of who you are , not yours .
( Laughter ) Don &apos;t go asking for a Frappuccino there .
It doesn &apos;t , I agree , look very much .
I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Wow , that was great — ( Laughter ) — please lady , don &apos;t say another word . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And the camera is down at her , and this guy has to put the microphone in her face , said , &quot; &quot; What do you mean by that ? &quot; &quot; And I figured , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s all over now , &quot; &quot; and she looks up and she says , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; she &apos;s still watching these guys go ; she says , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t ride a bike , &quot; &quot; no , she says , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t use a skateboard , and I &apos;ve never used roller blades , &quot; &quot; she knew them by name ; she says , &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s been 50 years since I rode a bicycle . &quot; &quot; Then she looks up , she &apos;s looking up , and she says ,
When we originally looked at bringing civil actions against terrorists , everyone thought we were a bit mad and mavericks and crackpots . Now it &apos;s got a title . Everyone &apos;s doing it .
I make the dove appear .
There &apos;s a bit of randomness here too because , when I was beginning Independent Diplomat , I went to a party in the House of Lords , which is a ridiculous place , but I was holding my drink like this , and I bumped into this guy who was standing behind me .
And so many opportunities get missed when that happens .
( Laughter ) Which tells you something about our place in the universe .
Why strangeness ? Because our social relations are increasingly mediated by data , and data turns our social relations into digital relations , and that means that our digital relations now depend extraordinarily on technology to bring to them a sense of robustness , a sense of discovery , a sense of surprise and unpredictability .
Most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day .
And I &apos;m grateful .
Here &apos;s the idea .
What about global politics ?
The only thing that they don &apos;t have is access to resources . They don &apos;t even have a textbook sometimes , and they don &apos;t even have a proper curriculum .
So , there &apos;s going to be a tremendous struggle .
Sughar is a local word used in many , many languages in Pakistan .

I have a wonderful visit to Facebook HQ coming up .
( Applause ) So let me tell you a little bit how this was done .
Because when we looked at the four platforms around the site , one of which is an upgrade of the families &apos; platform , we knew that these had to be moveable to respond to changing conditions , and the changing definition of what Ground Zero is .
And that &apos;s the difference between problems that are additive , like CO2 , which we go slowly up and then we tip , and problems that are depletive , in which we lose what we have , which oscillate , and they oscillate until we lose everything we &apos;ve got .
But I think that glamour actually has a much broader meaning — one that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters , but also comes in other forms .
For myself , I tried to get away from infectious diseases , and I didn &apos;t .
Let &apos;s start here .
And that led to all kinds of things , from being in curricula in universities and schools to — one of my favorite pictures I have from South Asia , it was a couple of men with long beards and a lot of girls wearing the hijab — it looked like a school .
There was shared attention looking at the same sort of thing , and recognizing socially communicated reinforcement at the end .
And all of the data , we aligned based on the following idea : Every time my son would learn a word , we would trace back and look at all of the language he heard that contained that word .
Here &apos;s a question that matters .
One way of thinking about it is to imagine what it would be like if language — where it could only be used literally .
And so does every wild habitat on the planet , like the Amazon rainforest you &apos;re hearing behind me .
What we can measure is that tangible stuff at the bottom of the pyramid .
And , so now , when the polar ice caps melt , my recording studio will rise up like an ark , and I &apos;ll float off into the drowned world like a character from a J.G. Ballard novel .
The more stress , the less brain development , which in turn causes less adaptability and causes higher stress levels .
Why do many people believe that India is still a growth disaster ?
Then we can actually see that what started out as just straight lines is actually a curve called a parabola .
We have to have treatment centers , specialized Ebola treatment centers , where the workers can be protected as they try to provide support to the people who are infected , so that they might survive the disease .
At the present time , my collaborators and I , what we &apos;re aiming for is much more modest — just to find partial connectomes of tiny chunks of mouse and human brain .
Probably the largest urban-renewal project , I think , ever attempted on the planet .
( Applause )
This was taken in the Riviera Sugar Factory in Red Hook , Brooklyn .
John McCain .
And that I do .
The words &quot; &quot; water &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; dry &quot; &quot; do not match , right ?
And then he got so excited , he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better , and the giant didn &apos;t run away , so he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible , bringing a creature of legend from the misty history into high-resolution video .

Because by definition , news is something that almost never happens .
Well , as a synonym , they often use ambiences .
All of origami comes from that .
And how fast do you think we are moving ?
So anybody who &apos;s ever looked at ants has seen them touch antennae .
And so we need to ensure that these people who are living with HIV or at greatest risk of HIV have access to legal services and they have equal access to the courts .
Here we have &quot; &quot; figure &quot; &quot; in white .
And I was a guinea pig , as I hope to continue to be in every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out .
And then I — this sort of thing is ideal for tidying up .

The opposite happened .
If you go back in time about &#91; 75,000 &#93; to 100,000 years ago , let &apos;s look at human evolution , it turns out that something very important happened around 75,000 years ago .
But I &apos;m also happy and honored to be up here and I think that it &apos;s great that I got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I &apos;d had more agency in my career , because maybe then I wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how I got my first job , or maybe I wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how I paid for college , which seems so important right now .
AV : We , or I ?
You &apos;re saying hey , you know , I don &apos;t think I &apos;m going to need them , so I &apos;m just going to trust that , you know , let &apos;s get rid of them , it doesn &apos;t really matter , these guys are going to do the right thing .
And surely , if you &apos;re reading a poem that mentions a cow , you don &apos;t need on the facing page a drawing of a cow .
And so I &apos;m so excited to discuss this with them , and I come in and I say , &quot; &quot; Can somebody please explain the main ideas and why this is so cool ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s silence .
Well , I think what part of the problem is that , in Haiti , although the problem is huge , somehow we understand it , it &apos;s localized .
Proximate self-similarity . And that accounts for this phenomenon .
It &apos;s a different way of thinking about it , but I think it &apos;s kind of beautiful , because it is certainly far more inclusive than the us-versus-them or the abled-versus-the-disabled , and it &apos;s a lot more honest and respectful of the fragility of life .
You open your eyes and there &apos;s the world .
He pointed out the river and the train tracks where the largest domestic slave-trading port in America had once prospered .

There &apos;s this fact that I love that I read somewhere once , that one of the things that &apos;s contributed to homo sapiens &apos; success as a species is our lack of body hair — that our hairlessness , our nakedness combined with our invention of clothing , gives us the ability to modulate our body temperature and thus be able to survive in any climate we choose .

I have eternal imposter syndrome .
There &apos;s certainly no quick security fix .
Voice : Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow , and everywhere that Mary went , the lamb was sure to go .
