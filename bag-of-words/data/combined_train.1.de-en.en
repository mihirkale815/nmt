so in summary , while radical openness is great , given how closed we are , even incremental openness could make things dramatically better . thank you very much .
finally , at the end of use , we could biodegrade it naturally along with your vegetable peelings .
it was purchased the year i was born , and it was extraordinary , because i did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information .
british researchers found that one smile can generate the same level of brain stimulation as up to 2,000 bars of chocolate .
we also , like a lot of companies , create a product that &apos;s based on technology trends .
you also have three microprocessors .
and since , in the last 20 years , i &apos;ve developed a studio in london .
there &apos;s the larvae , and they consume most of the food .
this is part of our collective narrative .
once again , these guys rock it out .
we went to them and they said , &quot; look , could you help us ? &quot;
we all know of them , but nevertheless -- the arabs say , &quot; the dogs may bark , but the caravan moves on . &quot;
now it could have come from one of two places .
the asteroids are a substantial amount of real estate , but not very large . and it &apos;s not very promising for life , since most of it consists of rock and metal , mostly rock .
and you never know when you &apos;re going to come across one of these booby traps .
and if there &apos;s one branch that is broken , then very quickly , because of the nodes of crossing -- internet engineers maybe call them hot points -- there are alternative pathways for channeling nutrients and information .
you could tell it wasn &apos;t a real jail .
i develop and test models of the big bang , using observational data .
if you want to keep going , if you want to change the camera angle , you can do that , and because of that , i can show you that voyager 1 doesn &apos;t just fly by saturn .
it &apos;s also full of anchor tenants at 20 dollars a foot -- triple that in the middle of the inner city .
we numb vulnerability -- when we &apos;re waiting for the call .
the controversy was so heated that the red cross had to open a press conference to clarify it , and the investigation is going on .
so i thought , okay , i &apos;ll try and make an electric toaster from scratch .
i then challenged the kids to identify someone in their own life , or in their own story , or in their own world , that they could identify that had done a similar thing .
i am a vicar in the church of england .
cut to our century , same country , same pyramids , another people spreading the same idea of equality with a different book .
and just the surface appearance are often -- like the astroturf here -- they make me wince .
oh , let &apos;s see here .
now , this has all these benefits : it &apos;s very beneficial in terms of the efficiency of communicating information ; it gives you access to a whole host of people ; it allows people to coordinate their activities in very good ways .
that leads to bad things , like rsi .
and i think that is an expansion of your moral compass when you manage to do that .
but my story that i would like to share with you today is the one about success .
thank you very much .
and growing up as we have , and holding very high the value of free speech , this is a hard thing for us to accept -- for all of us to accept .
i sometimes see when i &apos;m speaking to a congregation of religious people a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces because people often want to be right instead .
and he said , &quot; i grew the worst mustache ever . &quot;
that prisoner covered himself with shit every day , and they used to have to roll him in dirt so he wouldn &apos;t stink .
i said , &quot; well i will make a research about how islam actually came to be what it is today , and what roads were taken and what roads could have been taken . &quot;
america has now elected its first openly black president .
secondly , think about this .
we might divide it -- the plumber would say , &quot; well , where &apos;s the water ? &quot;
one of the things that &apos;s very frustrating about this is that we know , by getting modern neonatal incubators into any context , if we can keep premature babies warm , basically -- it &apos;s very simple -- we can halve infant mortality rates in those environments .
but in the computational universe , we &apos;ve now seen how rules that are incredibly simple can produce incredibly rich and complex behavior .
how are you going to scale ?
and i had snuck in this article on these things called carbon nanotubes , and that &apos;s just a long , thin pipe of carbon that &apos;s an atom thick and one 50 thousandth the diameter of your hair .
the flat sharp edges are like knife blades .
and i will now , here , onstage , try to predict when that will happen -- that asia will regain its dominant position as the leading part of the world , as it used to be , over thousands of years .
jonathan zittrain : the web as random acts of kindness
one of them happened to be me now .
in the united states , there are 60,000 people who have a pacemaker that connects to the internet .
we &apos;re now moving into east africa .
and the first mate takes a rope and ties odysseus to the mast in a nice knot .
how long have we been divergent from each other ?
julia bacha : pay attention to nonviolence
malcolm mclean was moving from one country to another and was wondering why it took these guys so long to get the boxes onto the ship .
we know why these scripts are there .
and i could be wrong , i don &apos;t know , but i wish you would come tomorrow . &quot;
and this is the earliest data that i can find .
and this is , i think , the predicament of our lives : that we don &apos;t take every opportunity to help because our focus is in the wrong direction .
the first was that these were no longer just temporary hits that the recession was giving men -- that this was reflecting a deeper underlying shift in our global economy .
it was not christmas time . there was a christmas tree .
so , this is a six-shot sequence .
reduce occurrence of cancer by a drug that doesn &apos;t even touch the cancer .
from the simplest version in nature , one branch , my engineering collaborator , ron fearing , at berkeley , had made the first synthetic version .
so just imagine : one day very soon , you &apos;re going to be able to plan a trip downtown and your car will be connected to a smart parking system .
rb : no , i mean , i think i learned early on that if you can run one company , you can really run any companies .
the digital highway would follow the rutted trail first blazed by alexander graham bell .
and we don &apos;t understand why they won &apos;t let us in . right ?
stefan wolff : the path to ending ethnic conflicts
so over the next couple of years , students and i worked to develop a process .
i traveled around the world , entered different cultures , wrote a series of books about my travels , including &quot; walking the bible . &quot;
now , look at the guy .
the first occurred because the dodgers &apos; catcher , roy campanella , came to my hometown of rockville centre , long island , just as i was in preparation for my first holy communion .
and there &apos;s a reason for that : we want to settle on an answer .
it was hard , it was a difficult road , but ultimately the leaders of the community came together , realizing we only have each other .
so we must solve this problem in order to become a space-faring civilization .
why ?
they have launched a divestment campaign that has now convinced , i think , 55 universities in 22 states to divest their holdings of stocks with regard to companies doing business in sudan .
here i am now , if this is the end ? thank you .
instead of taking off , she falls back , and she grabs paula radcliffe , says , &quot; come on . come with us . you can do it . &quot;
so that , this belief in each other , knowing that without a doubt and practicing that every day in whatever you do , that &apos;s what i believe will change the world and make tomorrow better than today .
but if you search for a stock photo of diarrhea in a leading photo image agency , this is the picture that you come up with .
there &apos;s no emotional reaction to his mother , because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut .
it has an amount of impact on the planet that &apos;s measurable .
its changes will affect all of humanity .
this has really invigorated me day-to-day , when i wake up , to try and do something interesting with my day .
while you &apos;re waiting around for your nuclear , you have to run the regular electric power grid , which is mostly coal in the united states and around the world .
we made it all freely available on the web , just to -- it was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause .
we gave the world the chemical identity of this molecule , typically a secret in our discipline .
never before has creativity of the millions been as effectively displaced , and displaced because of these , quote , &quot; infernal machines . &quot;
and i really hope that this will happen .
susan parks of penn state has actually studied this .
i did not choose to take up the pen , the brush , the camera .
and this is the opening day at the library of alexandria , the new library of alexandria , in egypt .
it &apos;s thousands of times , maybe 3,000 times tougher than this .
and this is my favorite one . my mother used to say to me , &quot; just because your sister jumps in the lake doesn &apos;t mean you have to . &quot;
what do you think i &apos;m looking at ?
it was senator obama when they created it . they changed the name later .
and i remember at the beginning of my career , again and again , on these dismal outings with orchestras , i would be going completely insane on the podium , trying to engender a small scale crescendo really , just a little upsurge in volume .
of course i can use this power for example for nice spinning -- we call it &quot; helicopter moves . &quot;
maybe i can add quickly this way .
so the monkeys get really good at this .
and pretty soon we were seeing sights like this .
there &apos;s going to be a lot of people .
so we were inspired by the oyster , but i was also inspired by the life cycle of the oyster .
i went to talk to them about certain of the great tragedies of western art .
i &apos;m extremely excited to be given the opportunity to come and speak to you today about what i consider to be the biggest stunt on earth .
it &apos;ll approximate that shape . we do this for real in the test tube .
that its transition from being something that we extract and derive from the world to something that actually starts to shape it -- the world around us and the world inside us .
other studies have shown that boosting oxytocin increases envy . it increases gloating .
but today , the way i want you to understand a black hole , for the proof of a black hole , is to think of it as an object whose mass is confined to zero volume .
and then the most complex are the solid organs .
and doing on titan what rain does on the earth : it carves gullies ; it forms rivers and cataracts ; it can create canyons ; it can pool in large basins and craters .
and so , for example , there is in texting a convention , which is lol .
not even the guys at tesla can fight that physics .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s that bad of a deal .
they get there and they realize it &apos;s fashionable now to have dogs a third as tall as your ceiling heights .
nell is interested in agricultural processes , and her work is based in these practices .
so the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do what we want him to do , and this is very easy .
he &apos;s basically worked the cost to puma .
so now -- -- thank you .
in a classroom with a reverberation time of 1.2 seconds , which is pretty common , this is what it sounds like .
these are both real objects .
and then , also , was working with broad strategies .
so i classify the people into three : uneducated , little educated , surplus educated .
i asked her what that meant , and she said , &quot; miss , it &apos;s kind of a long story . &quot;
and just as i was having that thought , he looked up at me and said , &quot; so that when i grow up , i can show this to my kids ? &quot;
each rung contains information .
and i kind of got a handle on it .
the last article is an article entitled &quot; no new frontiers . &quot;
this was going to be used as a touchstone so when they started to miss each other and feel disconnected , they could reconnect through this image .
amazing how many successful couch surfings there have been .
but a million a month in laptop-land is a big number .
and what if we go back beyond that single ancestor , when there was presumably a competition among many languages ?
here &apos;s what he wrote in starting that out .
it also says a whole lot of things about what mathematicians thought mathematics was , what they thought it could and couldn &apos;t do , what they thought it could and couldn &apos;t represent .
this was the pre-bureaucratic age , an age in which everything had to be local .
now recently , there &apos;s been development in this field .
orbital hotels to start with , but workshops for the rest of us later on .
i see hope . i see happiness in their faces .
and then some of the designs that people do they actually sell in the store .
the problem with ecosystems is that we understand them so poorly , that we don &apos;t know they &apos;re really in trouble until it &apos;s almost too late .
thank you .
you find them in all places in society .
social learning really is visual theft .
so , i came to give you a ride . &quot;
it has wonderful properties .
we started out with model airplane paint and then we found these wonderful little japanese markers , and they work really well .
and this is the most powerful light source in the solar system .
voice 1 : you &apos;ll have to stay here in the safe house until we get word the terrorist threat is over .
and you need a strong government to do that , because you cannot respect private property rights .
actually , she had never been to school , not to a lick , one day .
now my company , fark , deals with news , ostensibly , and as a result we were not in violation of this patent .
and as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear -- and we might be in range of doing something about aging -- this becomes part of the problem .
other organizations send volunteers .
so , what &apos;s needed now is to rebuild these boundaries .
&quot; but what if i saw them ? you know , couldn &apos;t we stay together ? &quot; &quot; no . &quot;
see , starbucks you awake , we keep you awake and alive .
and she goes , &quot; then how do they get fertilized ? &quot;
they started using linkedin and flickr and gmail and google maps , all these things .
so me talking about emotion is like gandhi talking about gluttony , but it is the central organizing process of the way we think .
and they told us one important thing : &quot; you shall not beta-test . &quot;
and there &apos;s actually an instruction on the punch card which says &quot; ring the bell . &quot; so you can imagine this &quot; ting ! &quot;
so , i began , early on , competing against the other kids , seeing how long i could stay underwater while they went up and down to breathe , you know , five times , while i stayed under on one breath .
and this change in thinking of human capital is linked to the fact that india is going through a demographic dividend .
but that &apos;s not all what we need to do . we need to use active systems .
certain subjects came up over and over : how much money they made , what kind of husband they hoped to marry , whether they should jump to another factory or stay where they were .
so i really hope our global audiences can relate .
so , i didn &apos;t do that . but design matters for a number of reasons .
you lose the institutional imperative .
i hope nobody finds that offensive .
the reason for this is incentives .
the small idea is , let &apos;s all of us engage more with this in the way that jason has illustrated .
well , if we &apos;re going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of millennium development goals that we &apos;re set as a world , we need to learn from the innovators , and those innovators come from every single sector .
we know what they are .
very good , us humans ! we &apos;re catching up with the computers .
i &apos;m going to divert and talk about bananas and chocolate .
so you can imagine the scale of this problem .
and hopefully we can show the audience now how it is you do what you do .
i &apos;m a convict ; i am branded &apos; wrong . &apos; what are you going to tell me about right and wrong ? &quot;
for the first time , media is natively good at supporting these kinds of conversations .
and a very important piece of research came out on friday from the institute of health metrics and evaluation in seattle showing that almost 50 percent of the fall in child mortality can be attributed to female education .
at the time my patient posed this question to me , breast density was an obscure topic in the radiology literature , and very few women having mammograms , or the physicians ordering them , knew about this .
in reality , it does not really make you safer .
but here &apos;s what we can say : what &apos;s natural in the last thousand years is that the planet was cooling down .
and in fact , if this is what coding is like , it will only be a narrow sub-community of people with special mathematical skills and technological background that can code .
so human history is viewed as sort of this downhill slide from the good old days .
i have been blown away by this conference , and i want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what i had to say the other night .
on the outside it looks like a very typical garage , a nice garage .
because we found that the relationship between the size of the brain and its number of neurons could be described mathematically , we could calculate what a human brain would look like if it was made like a rodent brain .
we feel so nice that our children can teach us how to read and write .
so i salute each of you and your stellar achievements .
here they go out of their regular , just to be part of that , to become part of the orchestra , and that &apos;s great .
so , i don &apos;t know , just stick with me . right ?
and what &apos;s been taking up the slack in the last few decades ?
but i have to get serious . and how do you get serious ?
that &apos;s what my mother in iraq used to tell me .
it &apos;s a very challenging task . but more to come later .
we &apos;ll look at ocean warming .
does it matter to the foragers what the nest maintenance workers are doing ?
thanks very much for your attention .
politeness is a much-overlooked virtue .
take some time to rest and think about things .
in a world with no systems , with chaos , everything becomes a guerilla struggle , and this predictability is not there .
airs were played in europe at burials , as a body was carried out from the wake site to the burial site , the procession was led by a piper or a fiddle player .
1996 : less than one million new university students in china per year ; 2006 : over five million .
i think it will be quite a challenge for me .
but i would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time .
but there &apos;s still a lot of unfinished business .
here we are on october the 19th .
they go in , and they might be working with a high school student actually working on a novel -- because we had very gifted kids , too .
a few years before he died , after he had resumed writing poetry , but in secret , he confessed to a friend in a letter that i found when i was doing my research : &quot; i &apos;ve written a verse .
that &apos;s what he was doing , propping up the bed because the bed simply didn &apos;t work .
i study this .
i wanted to know if what we human beings see and hear and think is a full and accurate picture of reality .
so if you cut open a little dinosaur , it &apos;s very spongy inside like a.
and then they had to figure out : &quot; well she needs furniture .
hans rosling &apos;s new insights on poverty
and believe it or not , you don &apos;t win juggling champions for doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups .
it &apos;s an antidote to the growing tendency we have to feel that we can really ever experience life by watching it on a computer screen , you know , when we &apos;re in a wi-fi zone .
and by the time i was an intern house officer , i could barely afford to maintain my mother &apos;s 13-year-old car -- and i was a paid doctor .
to those to whom it doesn &apos;t happen , there will be adversities .
i literally couldn &apos;t point to any physical construction .
he does , though , have a little bit of light down in the south that has a very special status .
we now call them non-avian dinosaurs and avian dinosaurs .
and again , it &apos;s fully interactive , so you can rotate and you can look at things in real time on these systems here .
the third lesson we learned is that policy matters . it really matters .
as i said , they were adventurous people .
because all businesses are man-made objects ; all business is involved with money ; all business is a matter of using machinery , and all those things make something inauthentic .
at that point , i became a little more ambitious and decided to see what else could children do with a computer .
and this is how they see the world .
you can &apos;t focus on what you &apos;re supposed to do .
but in the blind taste test , it came in last .
so , why doesn &apos;t it do it ?
so this was before the computer was invented .
that took me to this wet and warm band of the tropics that encircles the earth .
we all have done it , leaving the area because the sound in there is so dreadful .
and it means that you now eat products , which can come from all around the world .
it was so overwhelming , because the amount of things you have to do , it &apos;s just mind-boggling .
so , playing with fire .
and that is what origami used to be .
as a clergyman , you can imagine how out of place i feel .
same strategy .
but it depends not on chance , but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time .
think about it . really bring it to mind . this is important .
i have no interest in being in media business .
they still have an apple left .
here is a lump of flesh , about three pounds , which you can hold in the palm of your hand .
and watch her make eye contact with them right about now .
crime did fall .
that said , it &apos;s been really hard to ignore football for the last couple of weeks .
you all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades or of flipping a heads .
and so we retrofit these with sensors and processors , and these robots can fly indoors without gps .
the patient or spouse agrees not to file a lawsuit if one of the known procedure failures occurs .
it &apos;s way more energetic .
they then move out to the next one , and in the course of just a few weeks , the grass just enters this blaze of growth .
and we look at these exponential technologies from medicine , biotech , artificial intelligence , robotics , nanotechnology , space , and address how can we cross-train and leverage these to impact major unmet goals .
so actually , now the temes are forcing our brains to become more like teme machines .
but fortunately for the world , he did not have to pass an english test .
i didn &apos;t know where i was going , where i &apos;d come from , and i panicked . i had a total anxiety attack .
and the idea , their premise was that we wanted to show pieces of sculpture on the street , and there &apos;d be no subjective decision about what was the best .
they found clever ways to trade items and to sell their accounts to each other so that they could make money while they were playing their games .
ks : thank you .
how do we explore intelligence in this animal that &apos;s so different from us ?
the brain is removed from the skull , and then it &apos;s sliced into one-centimeter slices .
and if you look at it over here , the main thing i wrote on my thumb was the future .
is it worth it to you ?
this is just the food chain unfolding .
i have no more reason to blame myself .
and third , they &apos;re all attracted to each other , but they try to keep a small distance apart .
i think it &apos;s a problem of completion and delivery , because the fine print said , &quot; what game-changing ideas and scientific developments would you expect to live to see ? &quot;
this has never made much sense to me , this argument .
but of course , that only works when we have both of these components .
so i left work an hour early that afternoon and picked harry up at the school gates .
a human child is born , and for quite a long time is a consumer .
same pattern .
sadly , it &apos;s metaphorically true .
so , turning on a wave bubble might not just cause inconvenience .
and if we think of that -- let me put the picture up -- the fibers represent vulnerability .
so they shipped me off to the army , and lo and behold , many years later , i &apos;m considered one of the greatest sons the city college of new york has ever had .
he finds a local sporting team .
and during the evolution of life on the earth , it was the colonization of the land by plants that helped create the benign climate we currently enjoy .
do you know where your grandparents were born ?
another three years , no vision . he leaves again .
now giving the polio vaccine is simple .
but the next step is called &quot; universal responsibility . &quot;
now , in aberdeen , i started my dermatology training .
it &apos;s a precise specification with a precise formal language that causes mathematica to know what to do here .
it &apos;s got a remarkably clear yes / no answer , and just requires phenomenal grunt .
it is not my decision . my job is to make sure that every person , no matter what fate has assigned to you , will have the opportunity to get the best quality health care in life .
and a lot of my experiences resemble mirrors in some way .
thank you .
what has changed is how people respond to vague questions .
so , why aren &apos;t governments blaring this on television ?
she stayed at the top of her class through elementary school , middle school , she scored brilliantly on the national examinations so that she became the first person in her village , ever , to come to the united states on scholarship .
population growth will mainly occur among the poorest people here because they have high child mortality and they have many children per woman .
they want to , as jimmy said , they want to have a dialogue , a conversation .
i think we call it restorative seafood .
even in the oceans , we are creating a lot of light that we could actually ban also for animal life to have a much greater well-being .
regina dugan : from mach-20 glider to hummingbird drone
instead of going around the world and haranguing countries for engaging with china , the west should be encouraging its own businesses to trade and invest in these regions .
and in interactions with people , almost all the time , it is this kind of flexibility that is required .
when you &apos;re totally in the moment , when i &apos;m totally in the moment , the vessel of expression is open .
so , a problem in explaining how children learn language , a problem in teaching language to adults so that they don &apos;t make grammatical errors , and a problem in programming computers to use language is which verbs go in which constructions .
why do teenagers seem so much more impulsive , so much less self-aware than grown-ups ? cognitive neuroscientist sarah-jayne blakemore compares the prefrontal cortex in adolescents to that of adults , to show us how typically &quot; teenage &quot; behavior is caused by the growing and developing brain .
but in &apos; 96 they heard a few weird songs , and it turned out that these strange songs were typical of west coast whales .
that &apos;s much more important than running anti-viruses or running firewalls .
dh : so richard , what were we on the list ? like 1,020 ?
and it should come as no surprise that my first novel at 16 was about neo-nazis taking over nigeria to institute the fourth reich .
or , sometimes i take them to places that people have never heard of because they &apos;re underwater .
and my mind started racing , &quot; puerto rico ? what do i know about puerto rico ? &quot;
they thought you just wear out , there &apos;s nothing you can do about it -- kind of like an old shoe .
we &apos;ve now formed a company called amyris , and this technology that they &apos;re using can be used to make better biofuels .
it was an absolutely amazing experience .
we &apos;d like to tell our story better , and engage young people , and thereby change their perspective .
of course you need to be in physical , very good , condition , so i &apos;m training a lot .
and get this -- you &apos;ll have an eight-week vacation of doing absolutely nothing .
but soon we may see polio eradicated .
and then you have the emerging world cities , with a mixed variety of vehicles , mixed land-use patterns , also rather dispersed but often with a very dense urban core .
right there .
you will never be as young as you are right now .
it was surprisingly non-innovative , moved very slowly , but then there was just so much fiber out there , you couldn &apos;t hold back , and look how quickly the price fell .
that &apos;s what happens .
the first five days after the train crash , there were 10 million criticisms of the posting on social media , which never happened in chinese history .
baby shannon -- you can see her on the left -- is doing much better now , and ryan got a job by taking some of our courses .
&quot; that crazy woman . she &apos;s off again . she &apos;ll say anything won &apos;t she ? &quot;
and then my university education as an ecologist reinforced my beliefs .
we &apos;re trying to struggle to find our identity .
and so it &apos;s perfect for something like that .
so , we began through our nonprofit institute &apos;s training hospitals around the country , and we found that most people could avoid surgery , and not only was it medically effective , it was also cost effective .
to make the story short , here is the coverage of the country .
there are 12 pairs of 50 : 1 reductions , so that means that the final speed of that gear on the end is so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once .
and meditation or self-inspection is one of the ways -- again it &apos;s not the only one -- it &apos;s one of the ways of gaining this kind of inner power .
and this is after two years .
they said , &quot; you know , when do you want to come out ? &quot;
now , the question is , &quot; when will the catch up take place ? &quot;
they &apos;re looking at the really little stuff that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff .
and when i would feel sorry for myself as nine or 10 year-old girls do , she would say to me , &quot; my dear , on a scale of major world tragedies , yours is not a three . &quot;
dna is a very elegant molecule .
those of you from north america will be familiar with the monarch butterfly .
but then , i just thought that this human vision wasn &apos;t good enough .
now i see some puzzled looks like , &quot; why are you asking us what &apos;s the right thing to do ?
things are bad enough as they are . &quot;
and so , whereas dr. oliver sacks has talked about how perhaps one person in a million actually has true synesthesia , where they hear colors or taste shapes , and things like this , phonaesthesia is something we can all experience to some extent .
the problem lies with us : we &apos;ve become addicted to experts .
that &apos;s great .
so , you might be wondering , well , how do they do it ?
we have an awful , awful reality right now .
and yet we still insist , by and large , in thinking that we can understand china by simply drawing on western experience , looking at it through western eyes , using western concepts .
eight , nine , 10 .
and in that moment i understood that everything i had gone to thailand to look for , to search for , i had it already in my singing -- the calm , but alertness , the focus , but awareness , and being totally in the moment .
yay !
there &apos;s no working for each other across the colonies .
and everybody says -- i say -- it &apos;s an education project .
but , somehow , none of that adds up to me , to what i think india really can aim to contribute in the world , in this part of the 21st century .
you get up , it flushes by itself .
what you &apos;ve heard is true .
because they had banker hours basically .
culturomics is similar .

i stepped from my car and said &quot; shalom , &quot; and identified myself , and she told me that her husband abed would be home from work in four hours .
they believe juniper smoke is holy .
but this one was made out of a nylon tag out of my shirt .
the lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles -- a car approaching from the front , the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads , any obstacles around the vehicle .
and there &apos;s a lot of evidence that neural activity can cause your connections to change .
it &apos;s what we &apos;re going to use in the future .
let me now turn to the last project , which involves the national beverage of scotland .
so we really want to build a robot that anyone can use , whether you &apos;re eight or 80 .
it was central planning by mao tse tung .
and making sense of the financial crisis is very , very difficult .
now we knew , when we built this system , the whole point of it , just like with the palm pilots , was that you &apos;d have to , you &apos;d be able to collect the data and immediately upload the data and get your data set .
many of us have a social media presence -- a virtual personality made up of status updates , tweets and connections , stored in the cloud . adam ostrow asks a big question : what happens to that personality after you &apos;ve died ? could it ... live on ?
and roots and shoots is a program for hope .
and these are the types of animals that live in that three-dimensional space , that micro-gravity environment that we really haven &apos;t explored .
it would have the global reach of the world economic forum .
if it &apos;s very good , it &apos;s not going to work , because no one &apos;s going to notice it .
why else would we still be here ?
it &apos;s a means to an end , not an end in itself , and automation allows us to have that machinery .
we don &apos;t know where the structure is .
our school would show bill nye the science guy .
i don &apos;t think so . not a chance . but then , how on earth is it done ?
when you have 20 people and you are the one who has to decide ...
we need to get away from feeling , in the same way , human rights matters because of the other things it brings , or women &apos;s rights matters for the other things it brings .
and the consequence of cheap phone calling , free phone calling , to india , is the pissed-off programmer , is the outsourcing .
their usefulness varies and contributes to variation in the society &apos;s treatment of the elderly .
almost everybody knows this , from nobel laureates to golf caddies , or was taught it , as i was .
and you &apos;ll see why 1984 won &apos;t be like &quot; 1984 . &quot;
here &apos;s another quiz for you -- now suppose we &apos;ve got a test for a disease which isn &apos;t infallible , but it &apos;s pretty good .
in hospitals , they are security issues .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit more .
bb : there were many changes ...
we were in la zouche .
we tried in the water without any skin or ballast just to see how it works .
you could take that money and buy your banjo .
a guy named jeff brinker has found a way to have a self-assembling coding process .
ks : so that was the six we had for you today , but i hope you &apos;re starting to see why we find these things so fascinating .
what &apos;s going to happen to you between this point and that point ?
how can that not make you feel optimistic for the future ?
if anyone wants to try and play drums , then they can .
we saw geysers coming out .
this is why we have to solve our problems , and i know the answer as to how is to be able to get exquisite control over a building block of nature , the stuff of life : the simple electron .
we implemented this checklist in eight hospitals around the world , deliberately in places from rural tanzania to the university of washington in seattle .
so life was much more creative than we had ever thought .
you know , cameron sinclair yesterday said , &quot; how do i get everyone to collaborate on design globally to do housing for humanity ? &quot;
she calculated the up-front cost and the payback over time , and it &apos;s a net-plus on so many levels for the local , national and global economy .
this message is given as a public service .
and after i &apos;ve actually sculpted them , i have to paint them .
and i couldn &apos;t wait to get into the dark in the middle of the night , because that &apos;s when neil young comes out .
this is a physics and information theory term .
so what we &apos;re doing at the moment like calcium , potassium and magnesium from out of desalination brine .
it was that the nobel prize was the tombstone on all great work , and it resonated because i had won 35 out of 36 contests that i &apos;d entered over 11 years , and it made me bananas .
and behavior like this from janitors , from technicians , from nurses and , if we &apos;re lucky now and then , from doctors , doesn &apos;t just make people feel a little better , it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well .
so it &apos;s almost like fossils for the future .
this is a little plot , and every time you show a plot , you lose 10 percent of the audience .
this is something they can use instead of a firearm in those situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone . &quot;
i mean , it &apos;s not easy ; you see a lot of poverty .
the first embrace is something that we think , &quot; oh , this is very easy , &quot; but it &apos;s actually getting harder , and that &apos;s paying attention to the world around us .
you can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately .
boy : this one lighted up , and this one nothing .
it &apos;s not about genes .
every time you think of a city , you &apos;ve got to think green .
and these are my parents .
so that , very much , is in the realm of things i &apos;ve been interested in before .
with your eyes closed , what am i wearing ?
so i said okay .
it &apos;s a stronger risk factor than having a mother or a sister with breast cancer .
they wanted to replace scripture with culture .
so it seems that the only trait that survives decapitation is vanity .
they were spirited to safety . they were reclassified as yugoslav citizens and they managed to stay one step ahead of their pursuers for the duration of the war , surviving burnings and bombings and , at the end of the war , arrest by the soviets .
that &apos;s this line here , growing in power , these are what the iranians call the quietists .
and you can have anything in that room , anything you want , but you can &apos;t see anything .
so the question is : what are we doing ?
we rescued over 550 dancing bears .
you don &apos;t have to burn any incense , and you definitely don &apos;t have to sit on the floor .
well , from there , unfortunately , in 2004 , the project came to a halt . many political reasons .
and many of you were doing what great , if you will , tribal leaders do , which is to find someone who is a member of a tribe , and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe , and make introductions .
&quot; so are you carrying a needle ? &quot;
well , we did that 10 years ago .
and the brahmins and the gods , like in my story , always get to tell their truth as the truth .
the united states has to access that battle space instantaneously .
and it &apos;s kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse , except that you &apos;re now running a string of these things down .
the family &apos;s obese .
the broad consensus in neuroscience is that we can &apos;t yet diagnose mental illness from a single brain scan .
for some magicians or mentalists , sometimes the spoon will bend or melt , sometimes it will not .
he &apos;s going to pick up a grape -- he didn &apos;t drop it , he didn &apos;t break it -- and he &apos;s going to eat it .
ss : this is kanzi and i , in the forest .
i &apos;m here today to offer you that new model .
this is one such volunteer , and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked .
i knew this was happening . i knew the artic was warming .
dead easy to give him respect .
people weren &apos;t aware they could have that .
college graduates are not in short supply .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;ll affect the adults .
so it &apos;s extremely unfair towards the poor .
i think that is too simplistic .
you know what the clinching evidence was that space-time is curved ?
zk : our next technology comes to us from a company in japan called sekisui chemical . one of their r &amp; amp ; d engineers was working on a way to make plastic stiffer .
i was especially concerned of what the girls might think .
you have youtube , we have youku and tudou .
she had two sponges in her hand , and then she had two tied to her knees . my mother was completely absorbent .
when these things die , immediately , organisms come in and encrust and live on that dead surface .
so now imagine that i give each and every one of you 2,000 dollars -- 20 crisp hundred dollar bills .
and when you clean a penguin , you first have to spray it with a degreaser .
and we read every once in while about these crazy lawsuits , like the guy in the district of columbia who sued his dry cleaners for 54 million dollars because they lost his pair of pants .
but others turned this issue on its head , taking us to the possibility of a multiverse .
by laying fallow , i planted the seeds for a healthier future and was reunited with the ones i love .
driving them home , and they want them to be enlightened , so they take them to ben &amp; amp ; jerry &apos;s ice cream company with its own foreign policy .
and if we can catalyze a supportive community to come around these individuals and to participate in their story by lending a little bit of money , i think that can change the way we believe in each other and each other &apos;s potential .
here &apos;s my brain .
here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation .
but it &apos;s a hard process to do because , as you know , the middle of a star is quite hot , almost by definition .
you can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our technical capabilities improve .
like this .
it &apos;s that people start to say , &quot; when i really want to get stuff done , i go to the office . &quot;
here is another example of something which is -- this is a little spectrophotometer .
yeah , it &apos;s a fabulous movie if you haven &apos;t seen it .
they were in perfect condition , very fat and healthy , robust , no entanglement scars , the way they &apos;re supposed to look .
and there is some truth to this , in the sense that we have something of a finite resource , and increased growth is going to push up demand for that .
this here shows , on the y-axis , the increase in the probability that a person is obese given that a social contact of theirs is obese and , on the x-axis , the degrees of separation between the two people .
here &apos;s how the game is played : there are two players ; they &apos;ve never played the game before , they will not play the game again , they don &apos;t know each other , and they are , in fact , in separate rooms .
i dream of a wikipedia-like website that would explain any scientific concept you can think of in simple language any middle schooler can understand .
so , the fourth sort of post-crisis consumerism that we see is this movement about return to the fold .
and he says , &quot; osha ? ocean . &quot;
here &apos;s a really cool problem . i like this .
no , it looks like a mess . it looks like a mess with a guy there , who &apos;s got his hands around that mess , ok .
or the bobcat , needing rabbits and beavers and den sites .
and nowhere does the quality of an education system exceed the quality of its teachers .
this guy &apos;s measuring the water that this leaves in the stream .
thank you .
what if you could find out that , using the dna in museum specimens , fossils maybe up to 200,000 years old could be used to bring species back , what would you do ? where would you start ?
so , you might be wondering why it is that , every time we have high oil prices or an oil spill , we call these ceos down to washington , and we sort of pepper them with questions in public and we try to shame them .
so if we were to do that , what might sitopia look like ?
and they &apos;re not in too many zoos , because of their sexual behavior .
it landed on the surface . this is pictures taken on the way down .
it &apos;s been very confusing for a long time now .
remember , that &apos;s a short time .
gods we &apos;re still fighting about . oh yeah .
csi : climate .
like my next link , the almost irresistible link , ham the astrochimp .
we &apos;re not talking sport today .
but anyway , for some reason , i promised myself that i wasn &apos;t going to move , that i was going to do this thing that mummy wanted me to do .
i did so for a simple reason .
now i can divide my spoken word journey into three steps .
we need to bring health and food and education and respect for all god &apos;s citizens , all god &apos;s children , remembering mama eternal .
wk : this is my parents , holding the radio .
tremendous and beautiful discovery .
i started the program in capetown , south africa back in 2001 .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction , meaning you &apos;re saying that that sharp inflection -- ki-ki , in your auditory cortex , the hair cells being excited -- kiki , mimics the visual inflection , sudden inflection of that jagged shape .
it &apos;s got little dressing rooms and cabanas , where lots of interesting things went on , all summer long .
every red blood cell of your body right now has these hourglass-shaped pores called aquaporins .
uganda has 961 sub-counties , each of them with a dispensary , none of which has an ambulance .
you know , let &apos;s just make an educated guess , and they simply point and they go for 10 percent , right in the middle .
see , people who build world-changing tribes do that .
these animals and their demise occurs in the tuna fisheries .
all right , now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate .
she was chewing betel nut , which caused her teeth over the years to turn very red .
and it doesn &apos;t matter to me whether you &apos;re running a coffee shop or you &apos;re an intellectual , or you &apos;re in business , or you &apos;re flying hot air balloons .
as long as our books are written in english -- because people are rewriting them and recopying them -- it &apos;s going to be there .
islam actually , as a monotheistic religion , which defined man as a responsible agent by itself , created the idea of the individual in the middle east and saved it from the communitarianism , the collectivism of the tribe .
look in the gray areas , and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there -- yeah , it &apos;s amazing . there &apos;s nothing there . it &apos;s no trick .
i think it &apos;s because there &apos;s an imbalance , an asymmetry , in the way we treat creative , emotionally-driven psychological ideas versus the way we treat rational , numerical , spreadsheet-driven ideas .
and the pipa trust board holds that license and pays the country for this .
but it turned out it wasn &apos;t going to be as simple in the end , and it set us back three months because we had one error out of over a million base pairs in that sequence .
i told the priest right away .
and he invited us in particular because we have a very specific type of design process -- one that results in appropriate design solutions in places that don &apos;t usually have access to design services or creative capital .
that &apos;s all it takes , six-and-a-half grand per school .
lighting the merchandise and creating accents that help you to get around .
that &apos;s also an insult to history .
it &apos;s great that we have initiatives to say , let &apos;s go create the education and educate people in the world , because that &apos;s a great force for peace .
there were just bad for me .
i &apos;ve tried to look at the risks of reversion to conflict , during our post-conflict decade .
so it sort of raised more questions than it answered .
they are tested and accredited according to international mine action standards , just like dogs have to pass a test .
there &apos;s many , many more colors around us that we cannot perceive , but that electronic eyes can perceive .
so i tracked down one of the folks who makes these things , this guy in mali just outside of bamako , and i asked him , &quot; how come you &apos;re making fractal fences ? because nobody else is . &quot;
one nation , one system .
but the goal is to go much further and , very broadly , to democratize all of this knowledge , and to try and be an authoritative source in all areas .
six hundred degree f water coming out of the earth .
and my question is , how did we get from there to here ?
matthieu &apos;s own experience is that compassion is the happiest state ever .
this is really unpleasant stuff , and if it was any good , we wouldn &apos;t have this massive increase in mosquitos and we wouldn &apos;t have this massive increase in dengue fever .
before the light bulb was invented , people had figured out how to put a reflector behind it , focus it a little bit ; put lenses in front of it , focus it a little bit better .
and even though they &apos;re used in labs to promote human lives , they &apos;re also considered pests .
see , if i did it slowly , it &apos;d be back on your shoulder .
so i did the only thing my little frantic seven year-old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy .
either way , they present us with a huge moral and ethical dilemma .
and the reason it shouldn &apos;t be is that on any day you can go into trending topics .
and then the clouds came over us , and then , boom ! this massive thunderclap , and sheets of rain .
and again , he said , &quot; this painting of me with my son jeremiah shows me as the successful man that i feel that i am . &quot;
but we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands .
this seems more acceptable , but it still leaves god with the ultimate moral responsibility .
polar bears are amazing hunters .
actually you don &apos;t .
well , a poor understanding .
and if people are migrating into urban , unfamiliar , concrete environments , they can also be helped in anticipation with social supporters ready and waiting for them based on sms knowledge .
em : no , we don &apos;t patent . you didn &apos;t patent because you think it &apos;s more dangerous to patent than not to patent .
this is a river .
and our job is to convince the authorities that these forests have to be protected .
and the issue in africa is that there are fewer nurses , really than doctors , and so we need to find new paradigm for health care .
that shallow history shouldn &apos;t suggest to anyone that we have all of the answers for all of the questions that will confront us in the ensuing millennia .
we used to have to drive up a ramp , and we still do sometimes .
now , i want you to put your data on the web .
he certainly wasn &apos;t smiling when i got there , because he was somewhat humiliated by pauling getting the alpha helix , and the cambridge people failing because they weren &apos;t chemists .
rd : yeah , yeah . it did .
thelma golden : how art gives shape to cultural change
and i decided , it was an old dream that was lingering , that was from so many years ago , three decades ago -- the only sort of world class swim i had tried and failed at back in my 20s -- was going from cuba to florida .
clothed in this nylon bag , made in china , with the name of burqa .
and it led us to the project , the courthouse , which is absolutely a part of a negotiation between tradition and pieces of the traditional courthouse .
we maintain that , put that together as a project to really chart the universe across all scales .
we have problems with the tropical rains .
everybody looks at this prime minister of that country , and he says , &quot; yes . &quot;
this emerging economy really is helping the revival of the world economy .
what causes the bug ? is it the drama of the event -- that it &apos;s so spectacular ?
our intuition is really fooling us in a repeatable , predictable , consistent way .
and i can turn them all on , and you can see them moving across the sky now .
or you could spray .
and i -- you know , when i saw her , such a wonderful feeling .
i was writing a book about sustainable energy , and a friend asked me , &quot; well how much energy do you use at home ? &quot; and i was embarrassed . i didn &apos;t actually know .
but what if the option to have your car stolen was not exactly like this .
because we are counting on you .
at that point , can the child go home ?
so the project really addresses these three core issues in a new and exciting way , i think .
and you can do the same with your genes and track them back in time .
i was on bowman lake in glacier national park , which is a long , skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it , and my partner and i have a rowing shell .
it &apos;s a completely useless ability , if you think about it .
and passing her son to someone through a window .
it &apos;s a story that goes on long after his body no longer does .
dying is seen as failing , and we had a heroic narrative for fighting together , but we didn &apos;t have a heroic narrative for letting go .
everyone here cares about changing the world and has made a difference in that one way or another .
it &apos;s got the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain , where you have 100 billion neurons .
it &apos;s not like we had to find him actually killing somebody live to arrest him .
because big sisters are always supposed to support their little sisters .
anyway , i asked peter , by any chance , could he take us back to where he caught those thylacines .
every time somebody looks at you , you think people are staring at you .
so i &apos;m sorry about that .
so thinking about outcomes , it turns out appearances matter .
i learned one thing : when you walk the talk , people believe you .
the classrooms have no walls .
so we need new stories , new heroes and new tools .
and we have actually flown this vehicle and lost an engine , and continued to hover .
this is the at &amp; amp ; t performing arts center &apos;s dee and charles wyly theater .
all this field of view is a single strand of dna .
here &apos;s another case , a knifing .
to ask them to always have the right answer doesn &apos;t allow them to learn .
and perhaps this is the ultimate gift of feminism , that the personal is in fact the political .
but perhaps more than anything , what this thinking provides is a really positive way of talking about sustainable design .
no single person is really the ultimate actor behind the personality of a neighborhood .
but it turned out , after i sent the works to her , that her dad &apos;s friends , like most of you , are geeks .
so they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing .
but capitalizing on their enthusiasm , capitalizing on their energy means finishing the job that they started 20 years ago .
the rest goes to religion and higher education and hospitals and that 60 billion dollars is not nearly enough to tackle these problems .
experiments suggest that lightning could be the next gps .
a lot of reporters come to yemen and they want to write a story on al-qaeda or terrorism .
meaning white fur , ice blue eyes , a pink nose .
i didn &apos;t expect that person that i was going to meet to be him .
we could do work on the sea floor that would be stunning , and it would be on live tv , if we have interesting things to show .
it &apos;s on the x chromosome . and so in this way you can only get it from your mother .
is there a reason for this ? &quot; and a lot of the replies i got were that muscle is terminally differentiated tissue .
in this dramatically expanded ideal of a liberal arts education where the continuum of thought and action is its life &apos;s blood , knowledge honed outside the academy becomes essential .
so we measured nine other molecules that interact with oxytocin , but they didn &apos;t have any effect .
but those environments are going to be widely spaced in this universe .
but it &apos;s also very serious because all this accessibility stuff started coming up , where people can &apos;t use computers , necessarily .
i don &apos;t know , but we &apos;ll try it .
where is the small hadron collider ?
didn &apos;t go into the internet , kept his money , decided to go into computer games .
i &apos;ve had some great meals at cafeterias .
and when you kill orgasm , you kill that flood of drugs associated with attachment .
you &apos;ve obviously never opened all the toolbars , but all you have to type in is this little , teeny window down here .
i &apos;m the embodiment of all truth . &quot;
two , is other-directed : being what you say you are to others .
when that happens , you provide people with multiple ways of re-entering the world through different windows , and when you do that , it allows them to triangulate the world that they live in and see its shape .
and the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom is a fly in the middle of a sports stadium and the next atom is in the next sports stadium .
if you include all the drain , it takes more than a hundred pints of water to make a pint of beer .
and in that time she saved many girls . and when we met her we asked her what we could do for her , and she said , &quot; well , if you got me a jeep i could get around a lot faster . &quot;
but i wanted to go further than to say our brains make us moral .
we are going to merge with our technology .
when i speak at coaching clinics , i often tell young coaches -- and at coaching clinics , more or less , they &apos;ll be the younger coaches getting in the profession .
instead of doing that actually , we &apos;ve developed some fish sticks that you can feed the fish .
and in fact , because we can create spare parts with things the machines are quite literally making themselves .
i can &apos;t think of anything else that &apos;s happened in my lifetime that way .
and there are three main stages .
so you can imagine , if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting -- and he had hundreds of these stories -- you would have to relax .
so then , i ask , what &apos;s in it for you ?
these losses , they feel , emotionally , they feel very different from what we actually thought about it when markets were going up . &quot;
from lascaux to the louvre to carnegie hall , human beings have a permanent innate taste for virtuoso displays in the arts .
i only wanted data on the women who were going to be attracted to the type of man that i really , really wanted to marry .
why did she say that ?
in other words , solutions by the poor people need not be cheaper , need not be , so-called , jugaad , need not be some kind of makeshift arrangement .
first of all , ambience . i have a whole tedtalk about this .
none of these things is likely , but my , my philosophy is , look for what &apos;s detectable , not for what &apos;s probable .
you know that you can hold a 40-ounce bottle of rum and two bottles of coke in a wineskin ? so what , right ?
now as you know , a great deal of time is spent , inside the climate debate , on the question of , &quot; what if the ipc scientists are all wrong ? &quot;
the problem is enormous .
are these so bad that they outweigh condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death ?
and i &apos;d like to take you there , to that morning , for just a quick video .
go and study it . &quot;
but now with the internet , i &apos;ve just shown you a project where we &apos;ve gotten 750 million people to help us digitize human knowledge .
and oldenburg , who i work with a little once in a while , told me i couldn &apos;t do it , and so that made it even more exciting .
sometimes it &apos;s even 100 percent , much more than many privileged schools .
you have to act it out .
that was a nice thing to get .
this has huge implications .
my favorite is sophocles &apos; oedipus the king : &quot; sex with mum was blinding &quot; in a way , if you like , at one end of the spectrum of sympathy , you &apos;ve got the tabloid newspaper .
i &apos;m going to do some cuts .
down here in this little corner , here , we have the little sub-space of this larger space that is accessible to human beings -- beings with our biological capacities .
linda , my wife , joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals .
people are always going on about , &quot; how did september the 11th change you ? &quot;
but we all actually have the same capacity that they do , and we need to do their work now .
a haploid genome -- we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes -- a haploid genome is around 3.2 billion nucleotides in length .
so i changed the locations , and then we found the base pairing , and francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions .
i was on a three-month road trip this summer .
so you put these together . it &apos;s really hard to see how we &apos;re going to get to the rest of the century without at least doubling global agricultural production .
we are so honored to be here at tedwomen , sharing our music with you .
there &apos;s another drug out there .
it &apos;s in clothing and food and our transportation needs , our energy -- we sprawl just a little bit .
my own law firm has a list of questions that i &apos;m not allowed to ask when interviewing candidates , such as the sinister question , bulging with hidden motives and innuendo , &quot; where are you from ? &quot;
older americans are at a big disadvantage in job applications .
that agriculture will work better if there are railroads to get the goods to market .
16,000 kilometers , four generations , mind you , for a two inch long insect . it &apos;s quite incredible .
so , these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy-gurdy .
after all , they decide , and they did .
first , about a guy named nathan winograd .
but whoever decided that a chicken should look like a heart , a giraffe , a star ?
so imagine you have , say , a hoover in your home and it has broken down . you need a spare part , but you realize that hoover &apos;s been discontinued .
dh : the french judge gives it a 5.2 .
she should not go into banking , for example , or work at a cash register .
and it &apos;s almost impossible to perform .
i &apos;m going to pass it to this handsome gentleman .
so they basically put a map up on the wall , threw a dart , and it landed at a senior home here in colorado .
she was three years old and i was 15 .
but now we try to understand that in terms of the development of a part of their brain called the limbic system , so i &apos;m going to show you the limbic system in red in the slide behind me , and also on this brain .
so this is a student &apos;s opinion on what his experience of games are .
and not just in chicago , but in the entire united states .
most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food .
you know , it was going to be a nice long trip .
think about something you &apos;ve always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next 30 days .
and so they &apos;ve come up with their own set of rules , the &quot; rules of the internet . &quot;
but as a scientist , i &apos;m interested in a different problem of other minds , and that is the one i &apos;m going to introduce to you today .
it was created by scientists , but it couldn &apos;t have been created if they didn &apos;t have a printing press as a tool .
so this approach that we &apos;re taking for cancer prevention may also have an application for obesity .
and he has done path-breaking work on autism and confirmed , also for the authorities here , that gary mckinnon -- who is wanted by the united states for hacking into the pentagon -- suffers from asperger &apos;s and a secondary condition of depression .
