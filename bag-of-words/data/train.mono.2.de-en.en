we published our results in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences and in nature biotechnology .
this was , at a distance , realizing that someone was feeling something , wanting to affect them in a particular way , using media to do it , putting it online and realizing that there was a greater impact .
it &apos;s really important . using applications is ok , but programming is absolutely fundamental .
the war metaphor forces us into thinking that you &apos;re the winner and i lost , even though i gained .
maybe it even got published in a high-profile scientific journal .
i spend as much of my time as possible investigating the marine life .
and i feel very privileged to have stumbled across it living in the maldives .
so this is a story of a place that i now call home .

and as we start to integrate this information , we &apos;re going to know better what to do with it and how better to have insight into our own pathologies , health and wellness .
and no one had systematically looked at the wall tissue .

they &apos;ve been building it so long i don &apos;t remember where it is .
san francisco is also spending 40 million dollars to rethink and redesign its water and sewage treatment , as water outfall pipes like this one can be flooded with seawater , causing backups at the plant , harming the bacteria that are needed to treat the waste .

it was so simple , in fact , that i suspect a really smart high school student , who didn &apos;t even have calculus , could understand what he wrote down .

sometimes you get a little star applause , and then i think even bill gates takes a nervous breath , and the talk begins .
thank you .
our calculation shows that quantum tunneling of the higgs field is not likely to occur in the next 10 to the 100 years , and this is a very long time .
because there &apos;s huge opportunities in that .
but i wanted to work only and truly with business and media leadership to totally reframe disability in a way that was exciting and possible .
this is the guy who started the project in my lab , and this is the guy who &apos;s been doing prostate stuff .
anybody ? all right .
it didn &apos;t make them less happy , it just didn &apos;t do much for them .
one of my colleagues in bulgaria , nevena markova , spent about 20 years studying these profiles .
here &apos;s what i was saying about the laws . they &apos;re really there .
and there are thousands of other examples of this happening -- of video-driven evolution of skills , ranging from the physical to the artful .
is this real ? does the language matter , because he &apos;s not supposed to know english ?
we looked at smoking and drinking behavior , and voting behavior , and divorce -- which can spread -- and altruism .
but the man had somehow a lot of room at the bottom .
we have fit over 5,000 amputees , and one of the big indicators we &apos;re looking at , of course , is , does it improve lives ?
from the moment that our ancestors , perhaps two and a half million years ago or so , began imitating , there was a new copying process .
again , opportunity to tackle markets to get that higher price .
i think you matter to god ; i think you matter to history ; i think you matter to this universe .
and so a plan came up to video the vote .
so in 2011 , power shifted , from the few to the many , from oval offices to central squares , from carefully guarded airwaves to open-source networks .
and when you go home , think of what you are going to change in your research on the following day to make their lives better . &quot;
so , the electromagnetic force , the force that holds us together , gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures .
what lies within us can never be truly colonized , contorted , or taken away .
i had been seduced by that potato and not another into planting its -- into spreading its genes , giving it a little bit more habitat .
and if you just look at how technology has been applied , we &apos;ve solved all the long-range , high-speed , high-volume , large-weight problems of moving things around .
sweden was like sierra leone today .
i wanted it to be something that was not addressed to them or signed by me , something that caused them to wonder what on earth this thing was .
so there were 66,000 of these .
and so she thought , well , what the heck .
you &apos;re not making news out of things falling down .
so they knew at that stage they could carry large weights .
and in the worship of my church , the most frequently used adjective about god is &quot; almighty . &quot;
and when i throw this up into the air and catch it , it has the full three-dimensional structure of the protein , all of the intricacies .
let &apos;s take a look .
so , like , ok , maybe it had to do with the patterns on the little pieces of paper -- you know , like , it was a diamond , or , you know , diagonal .
and when i looked at the sequence of the dna , and compared the sequence of jonas &apos; tumor to that of the rest of his body , i discovered that they had a completely different genetic profile .
he wanted a bigger band .
in the moment , that &apos;s what he did .
and as more of us move into cities , more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me -- it &apos;s soybean fields in mato grosso in brazil -- in order to feed us .
it was a phenomenon where young brides were committing suicide in rural gujarat , because they were being forced to bring more and more money for their in-laws &apos; families .

paul maccready : the wings could touch together on top and not break . we think .
matthieu &apos;s brain scan shows that compassion is not a chore .
and here &apos;s the simplest version in nature , and here &apos;s my collaborator ron fearing &apos;s attempt at an artificial version of this dry adhesive made from polyurethane .
you see , japan did it like that .
so hang in there , and you come up with some pretty peculiar solutions .
there &apos;s a number of mines placed blindly , and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the targets .
it sounds like it was written by an old school teacher of mine .
so we &apos;ve made a silk card with penicillin in it .
i brought it to paul maccready &apos;s company aerovironment to do a feasibility study , and they analyzed it , and came up with a lot of innovative ideas about how to propel it .
this is by jason birdsong .
this , for example , this gentleman is called joseph .

i want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight-track tape .
and he pulled it toward him , like so , and he took the knife and he put it on the tip .
harvest bombs .
and the answer i have right here in my pocket , if i get it .

bobby kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message in indianapolis .
and as an architect , i &apos;ve always found these kinds of systems very limiting , because i &apos;m not interested in ideal forms and i &apos;m not interested in optimizing to some perfect moment .
kofi annan said , &quot; this will be beneficial to my troops on the ground . &quot;
and this is the oscilloscope of the whirlwind electronic computer .
you &apos;re thinking , &quot; wikipedia doesn &apos;t say this fact . &quot;
but they &apos;re adapting quickly .
and as you can see , it &apos;s about eight inches in diameter .
so that peak expiratory flow rate , i &apos;ve entered it up into the interactive software model .
well an idea is that that strategy , that learning strategy , is an extremely powerful , great strategy for getting on in the world , but it has one big disadvantage .
i don &apos;t want to write that stuff . &quot;
it &apos;s a pathological , democracy-destroying corruption , because in any system where the members are dependent upon the tiniest fraction of us for their election , that means the tiniest number of us , the tiniest , tiniest number of us , can block reform .
theirs are actually flavored with miso and sesame paste , so they &apos;re not as sweet as our version .

so you get a big squeeze .
so i do believe that one of the defining fights of our times will be the fight for the control over personal information , the fight over whether big data will become a force for freedom , rather than a force which will hiddenly manipulate us .
and then we &apos;re off to the races , because i don &apos;t believe for a second that we have forgotten how to solve tough challenges or that we have become too apathetic or hard-hearted to even try .
because they weren &apos;t tracking where the kids were before that .
they are what i consider to be the cities of tomorrow , the new urban world .
there was an fao conference last october that was completely devoted to this .
he did this because he understands data as well as books .
they work by harnessing shoulder power .
i go in their homes . and we do this worldwide , and we follow them around town with video cameras .
literally scrambling through what &apos;s called pressure ice -- the ice had been smashed up under the pressure of the currents of the ocean , the wind and the tides .
so we took a room downstairs in the basement that had been used as sort of an abu ghraib annex .
and i have done this throughout my work .
in red , sort of below oecd average .
they were around me in three directions .
but guys , if history has taught us anything , it &apos;s that if you can imagine it , you will get there eventually .
i don &apos;t think there was ever a day where i cut hair i was nervous .
i mean , when i asked them to summarize the 10 tedtalks at the same time , some took the easy route out .
self-deception .
we especially emphasize areas of great relevance to africa &apos;s development , because , in those areas , scientists working in africa will have a competitive advantage .
or if there was a hole i &apos;d think like , oh damn , there was actually someone thought of that thought already .
that was another thing that really touched me .
but that doesn &apos;t change my belief that all of us , deep inside , here in this room and across this country , share a similar set of desires .
and with our minds we can rationalize anything .
this is not just in hebrew , by the way .
and i explained , &quot; it &apos;s a dark night and a crow is perching on a branch . &quot;
one is : you can &apos;t accommodate everybody .
many people have harmed me in my life , and i remember them all , but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with the people who &apos;ve helped me .
i really get fed up when they , you know , the teachers , especially when you get away from this part of the country , they don &apos;t know what to do with these smart kids .

and so i made a drawing with a fish , and i left japan .
this was a woman who didn &apos;t have trouble with her eyes , but the visual parts of her brain , a little tumor in the occipital cortex .
and if we don &apos;t have fire , we actually could not live .

i know the free market fundamentalists will tell you that more growth , more stuff and nine billion people going shopping is the best we can do .
it &apos;s one of the things that we don &apos;t like to think about , but the fact that religious icons and good luck charms show up on dashboards around the world betrays the fact that we know this to be true .

and it was a house where girls could run away , they could save their clitoris , they wouldn &apos;t be cut , they could go to school .
you know this , if you &apos;re doing something you love , an hour feels like five minutes .
so we are right now doing some systematic field tests to basically ascertain whether something like this actually makes sense to the asha worker .
well thank you . that shot the timing .
now , i don &apos;t know if one of the editors was a woman , but that can make the biggest differences .
i not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls like carnegie hall and kennedy center , but also hospitals , churches , prisons , and restricted facilities for leprosy patients , just to mention a few .
your google science fair champions .

losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden .
when the book became the best-selling book in the world for the last three years , i kind of had my little crisis .
except , you still may not really recognize them , and that &apos;s because we have to work in three dimensions .
but burst-pulsed sounds is a bit of a mystery .
and so we didn &apos;t build any models , and francis sort of continued to work on proteins .
looked first to the courts and the legislatures to try to get them to do something to make the system make more sense .

people like rashani zafar , who created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country , and is a real role model for women inside and outside the country .

this is the spacecraft taking nine months to get to mars .
now we are able to follow them and find out their secrets , where the babies go after they hatch , and remarkable things like this you &apos;re about to see .
it &apos;s changing our lives in so many ways , and it will continue to do that .

satellite television and the internet are informing and empowering young muslims in exciting new ways .
so , the dialogue with the local and the global , the audience as participant and player and protagonist , the innovative use of site , all of these things come to play in the amazing work of the fantastic french company royal de luxe .
the problem with that view is like asking all the winners of lotteries , &quot; have you won the lottery ? &quot;
but 99 percent of chinese microbloggers stand firmly on the embassy &apos;s side .
thank you .
luanda , it was full of land mine victims who were struggling to survive on the streets and war orphans living in sewers under the streets , and a tiny , very wealthy elite who gossiped about shopping trips to brazil and portugal .
flight pilots practice in flight simulators so that they don &apos;t make real mistakes in planes .
so , we believe that on europa there is , in fact , a deep ocean .
what that suggests is that , even in the case of hearing loss , the capacity for music remains .
she did so much . she was a playwright .
now , two weeks ago , that dream took a step forward , when the state of nevada granted google &apos;s self-driving car the very first license for an autonomous vehicle , clearly establishing that it &apos;s legal for them to test it on the roads in nevada .
and also , the easiest one was when i was doing it in form of a music .
so the question is : what are they all doing ?
and here the story is fairly simple .
but not the south africa we always talk about -- the gold , the minerals , the first world infrastructure -- a bit about the other side of it .
they claim to be psychics , or sensitives , whatever they can .

surfers , for example , know this incredibly .
these are cholera beds in haiti .
they &apos;re difficult integrals .
but for us , the rain is good .
and i said -- i got worried , i said , my god , i mean i &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body image , what about human subjects , ethics and all of that ?

they owe us , to put a food ambassador in every major supermarket .
it &apos;s this pervasiveness , combined with the centrality to what it means to be a human , the fact that we can tell the truth or make something up , that has fascinated people throughout history .

so they &apos;re spinning these tiny nano fibers of pure cellulose .
this is very early rehearsal footage , but the finished work &apos;s on tour and is actually coming through l.a. in a couple weeks .

this tree frog has toes .
this game &apos;s called &quot; spore . &quot; i &apos;ve been working on it for several years .

joshua prince-ramus : building a theater that remakes itself
i worked on this for some 14 years , and i think it helped me become a better teacher .
and the conclusion of that is that psychology and psychiatry , over the last 60 years , can actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable .
they were doing something much simpler .
so i &apos;m a social scientist by training , so why am i here today talking about smart materials ?

and , yes , they were great philanthropists .
twelve years ago , i was in the street writing my name to say , &quot; i exist . &quot;
and you can see here , as this animates over , steven &apos;s actual data against the background of all other patients , against this information .

i had them right at hand .
so mundane sounds can be really interesting if you pay attention .
it made me question and curious : how could someone actually find joy in cleaning toilets for a living ?
there &apos;s a great deal of argument about whether we , as the great nation that we are , should be the policeman of the world , the world &apos;s constabulary , but there should be virtually no argument about whether we should be the world &apos;s healer .
thank you very much . thanks .
the other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important , and so naturally , people sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities .
so i went searching when i started in this game to convince myself that there was any degree of plausibility to this whole crazy story .

here &apos;s how apple actually communicates .
put your book beneath it and you can read .
unfortunately , empirical data , good , hard stats , don &apos;t exist , and therefore to prove my point , i first of all had to find some proxy way of uncovering how much food was being wasted .
if you stop that behavior on one group that you &apos;re experimenting with , and you allow it in another group that you &apos;re experimenting with , and then you present those rats with a cat odor-saturated collar , they &apos;re hardwired to flee and hide .
we &apos;re threatened by the greatest weapon ever , and knowing a good thing when it sees it , the air force decides it needs the biggest computer ever to protect us .
and the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the end of the summer when they have built the farmers &apos; market and it &apos;s open to the public -- that &apos;s the final exam .

i travelled for a month in nepal with our good friend , matthieu ricard , and you &apos;ll remember matthieu famously said to all of us here once at ted , &quot; western science is a major response to minor needs . &quot;
for so many years we have fed on aid .

i add new images because i learn more about it every time i give it .
no , i think that &apos;s wrong .
immediate detection , immediate response .
i met a father the other day ; he looked a little crazed .
the trickster has a mind that is prepared for the unprepared .
most people are entirely unconscious of these filters .
why do we respond so much to our knowledge of where something comes from ?
the eye is still transparent and you can get light in .
and i also photographed the gift bag they gave me when i left .
and so i got interested in electronics , and you know , i studied to get my ham license . i was wiring up stuff .

now , a completely different thought .
now sometimes neuroscientists need to identify individual molecular components of neurons , molecules , rather than the entire cell .
again , gathering together farmers , gathering together stakeholders in east africa to get standards for organic produce . better prices .
somehow i ended up at the hospital .
and we can be doing it if we could just get over the fact that this little slice of things is going to be for free .

natasha told me that a lot of the kids thought she was stuck up , because they would talk to her and she wouldn &apos;t answer , and they didn &apos;t realize she didn &apos;t actually speak english very well , in the beginning .
that &apos;s our next big challenge .

and when we color-code this image , to bring out the faint light levels , we see that these jets feed a plume that , in fact , we see , in other images , goes thousands of miles into the space above enceladus .
i &apos;ve been all around the world , and there will be a thousand kids crying out your name , and it &apos;s such a weird , visceral experience .
and i know this footage isn &apos;t going to look like anything to you -- we had a crummy camera at the time -- but i was ecstatic .

evelyn glennie : well then , stop clapping . try again .
we can &apos;t hatch plans and climb that stairway of popularity , of success .
now , my brother and i had never heard anything like that in our whole lives . it was so beautiful .
and i don &apos;t have to do anything .
so , what &apos;s significant about this to me isn &apos;t that we can train crows to pick up peanuts .
it has 2,000 life cycles these days .
and i &apos;m going to kick it to keith to explain why that &apos;s important from a technical standpoint .
there are a handful that have escaped into the mainstream , the ones i &apos;ve just shown you , but every day , every month , people are producing thousands of these .
charles darwin and i and you broke off from the family tree from chimpanzees about five million years ago .
now why , steve , why do we need a revolution ?
just because people can &apos;t see us doesn &apos;t mean we &apos;re going to necessarily lie .
now as it turns out -- thank you .
i have a couple of ideas to begin with .
sayyid qutb is one of the founding fathers of fanatical islam , one of the ideologues that inspired osama bin laden .
it turns out that regular play-doh that you buy at the store conducts electricity , and high school physics teachers have used that for years .
to create is to make something that has never existed before .
the way i want to do this is to build a facility where i can study this .
what a 404 page tells you is that you fell through the cracks .
if you look at this building in chile , it &apos;s ripped in half , but it &apos;s not a pile of rubble .
but there &apos;s no way to learn to fly like a hummingbird unless you fly .
but i still think that this -- -- may be this year &apos;s version of this .
so i thought of a different way by thinking , well , the talks revolve around certain themes .
five to seven percent only are inspected -- five to seven percent .
he came up to me and said , &quot; thank you for starting movember . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know what the rules were , i &apos;m a natural born scientist , i guess , or some kind of a throwback to the 17th century , whatever .
we have art students getting together , taking old radiator parts and doing an iron-pour to make something new out of it .
now everybody agrees that thyroid cancers are sky high , and that chernobyl evacuees suffer the trauma of relocated peoples everywhere : higher levels of anxiety , depression , alcoholism , unemployment and , importantly , disrupted social networks .

we want to develop these little tiny capsules about the size of a piece of risotto that we can put into the muscles and telemeter out the emg signals , so that it &apos;s not worrying about electrode contact .
they talked about feeling stronger and braver .
maybe you ought to buy efficiency at 26 bucks instead of 12 .
and now who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip -- not about you -- was spreading through the network ?
that &apos;s the reason i &apos;m using this podium and using these notes .
sierra leone down there . mauritius is up there . mauritius was the first country to get away with trade barriers , and they could sell their sugar -- they could sell their textiles -- on equal terms as the people in europe and north america .
like yourself , i &apos;m a complex amalgam of positive and negative personality traits that emerge or not , depending on the circumstances . &quot;
so i began drawing the story that was moving in my head .
can you even imagine what that looks like ?
instead of a weapon , just this shepherd &apos;s staff , and he says -- he &apos;s insulted -- &quot; am i a dog that you would come to me with sticks ? &quot;
when i got out i had a choice .

a normal investment bank is not a deposit bank , it &apos;s an investment bank ; it has 15 to 20 times .
it &apos;s some strange woman pretending to be my mother . &quot;
so there is no life possible at that type of mutation rate .
it &apos;s fallen by half .
but daylighting our creeks really improves their water quality and contributions to habitat .
you &apos;d be able to open portions in order to change the procession , allow people to come in and out for an intermission , or to enter for the beginning or the end of a performance .

air quality is an obvious thing to anyone who breathes .
my brother is kind of busy .
and my son , youngest son who studied in beijing , in china , he got a long-term perspective .

these are just for information : hypertension , diabetes , obesity , lack of exercise . the usual suspects .
number three -- isn &apos;t this stuff cool ?
our objective is to be a millennium city , just like many millennium cities around : istanbul , rome , london , paris , damascus , cairo .
this picture was taken last year .
and if one were to eclipse the milky way , this is what it would look like .
throughout human history people have played games .
and you put a little fan here .
well , first of all , let me thank emeka -- as a matter of fact , ted global -- for putting this conference together .
anyway , in this same kind of approach , i designed k.
day one , day two , day three , day four , day five , day six .
we have the magic porridge pot in the form of walmart and tesco .
well , it was the whole city .
there is a problem with vaccines around the world not getting to patients . and the reason is that the refrigeration somehow gets broken ; what &apos;s called the &quot; cold chain &quot; gets broken .
now brunel may have asked a question like this , &quot; how do i take a train from london to new york ? &quot;
it &apos;s axiomatic . why not us ?
the vast grasslands of patagonia are turning to desert as you see here .
apple undoubtedly brings this innovation to us early , but its time was approaching because its core technology had been evolving for decades .
nathaniel kahn : scenes from &quot; my architect &quot;
there &apos;s 21,000 employees . this one factory -- and they had several of them -- is half a kilometer long .
but in the long run , if there &apos;s no life there , we create it ourselves .
so , our call to action -- my call to you -- is for you to make going green your next big thing , your gig .
and over the ensuing few years , there were great sagas about designing biosphere 2 .
augmented reality is just the latest technology .
this effect is so robust that we find it no matter how we ask the question .
so we started to change genes at random , looking for long-lived animals .
talk to people in restaurants .
when did that last happen ?
and it turns out that a sound like this is the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their call across the fields and savannahs .
they looked outside , and then they changed what was on the inside .
we went in underneath and tapped it , and we found that it had the ph of drano .
here is a graph that he put together showing the percentage of male deaths due to warfare in a number of foraging , or hunting and gathering societies .
and it gets worse , i crashed it into your house .
so i remember getting my american passport .
nina tandon : caring for engineered tissue
so i am one of those people with a transformative personal story .
rb : no . i suppose if you &apos;re having problems getting a booking in a restaurant or something , that might be worth using it .
or , even better , let &apos;s just take people right out of the emergency room -- undefined , community-acquired respiratory tract infections .
as i slowly lost my speech , i gained my voice .
this whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point where i could say &quot; synecdochically &quot; to all of you .
and i think it &apos;s an idea worth spreading .
now , most school districts can &apos;t really afford organic food , but we , as a nation , have to start thinking about consuming , growing and feeding our children food that &apos;s not chock-full of chemicals .
it &apos;s china there , moving against better health there , improving there .

torsten reil talks about how the study of biology can help make natural-looking animated people -- by building a human from the inside out , with bones , muscles and a nervous system . he spoke at in 2003 ; see his work now in gta4 .
for two reasons , i think .
this is a dolphin that is self-aware .
i &apos;ve had the privilege of living by a meadow for the last little while , and it is terribly engaging .

well , we know that they can roll balls in a straight line using celestial cues .
but they failed , almost completely , to make any .
the first kind tells you , &quot; you can do it ! you can make it ! anything is possible ! &quot;
this is a big question now to help us understand why they should be in the city .
we call this antiangiogenic therapy , and it &apos;s completely different from chemotherapy because it selectively aims at the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers .
this is just an example of one of these computable documents .
it wasn &apos;t like a telephone system where you had control of a line : you had to share packets .
they go from eight cents a mile in 2010 , to four cents a mile in 2015 , to two cents a mile by 2020 .

we have some cameras on the south edge of the ilulissat , watching the calving face as it goes through this dramatic retreat .
there &apos;s an impact , it &apos;s cumulative .

and they invented , what ? gavage .
despite the fact that each and every one of these disorders originates in the brain , most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis of observable behavior .
living in your genome is the history of our species , and you as an individual human being , where you &apos;re from , going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years , and that &apos;s now starting to be understood .
but when he &apos;s in the arena , at best he wins , and at worst he loses , but when he fails , when he loses , he does so daring greatly . &quot;
secondly , to create even more intensive and strict public demand to reduction of chemicals in the agricultural fresh produce .
&quot; but why ? &quot; i asked him .
so the good news is that earlier this year , the state council passed a new regulation on house requisition and demolition and passed the right to order forced demolition from local governments to the court .

fabian oefner : psychedelic science
we &apos;re actually teaching him .
andy hobsbawm : we &apos;ve got the science , we &apos;ve had the debate .
i work with a species called &quot; bonobo . &quot;
so i was so moved by this -- this is incredible . this was connecting , right .
bush &apos;s bigotry was not an isolated mistake , blurted out in the heat of the moment and later retracted .

the ones on the left are from africa , from around a million years ago .
and then i thought -- in my 40s i started thinking , &quot; well , why don &apos;t i do something ?
are we born to be optimistic , rather than realistic ? tali sharot shares new research that suggests our brains are wired to look on the bright side -- and how that can be both dangerous and beneficial .

what we need are people who see the value in investing in these types of local enterprises , who will partner with folks like me to identify the growth trends and climate adaptation as well as understand the growing social costs of business as usual .
so , they started giving me the statistics on how many of these kids had lost an arm .
now , places that didn &apos;t do this -- new york city for example , moscow , jakarta -- we &apos;re talking , at its peak , one in two injectors infected with this fatal disease .

on it , everyone you love , everyone you know , everyone you &apos;ve ever heard of , every human being who ever was lived out their lives .
we would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with -- of course , in the long run , also to deal with global warming .

without provocation , suddenly she attacked , against her prime minister &apos;s orders , the next-door neighbor &apos;s oil fields .

so we &apos;re 35 years behind .
it &apos;s about a meter tall pavona clavus colony .

there are no contracts , no written contracts .
it &apos;s exciting to see that in terms of what we &apos;ve learned , but how many of those 4,000 diseases now have treatments available ?
once it &apos;s a closed system , you will have legal liability if you do not urge your ceo to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided . the market will work to solve this problem if we can accomplish this .
let me leave with one final thought , and that is that one of the greatest english language writers of the last three decades suggested that great art is always a gift .

it is this underlying assumption of limitlessness that makes it possible to take the reckless risks that we do .
if a soldier sees his friend blown up , his brain goes into such high alarm that he can &apos;t actually put the experience into words , so he just feels the horror over and over again .

people who grew up in a place like this did not have the opportunity to climb trees and form a relationship with trees and forests , as i did when i was a young girl .
and we have a much longer way to go when it comes to the idea of restoring perfect hearing .
it was then that i came across these books , and in these books i discovered the idea of task shifting in global health .
we &apos;re doing 15-minute exams with patients .
it doesn &apos;t matter if you fail .

the military council has cracked down on civil society and protests and the country &apos;s economy continues to suffer .
we &apos;re measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day , particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums .
vodka , gin -- yes . yes . you know your mice well .

you &apos;re mad . i &apos;ll drive . i know i can drive . &quot;
which is why i say it &apos;s a social justice issue .
why are we embedded in social networks ?
so i said , have what , shall i translate the internet into some indian language ? that &apos;s not possible .
i just have a feeling this kid &apos;s been there for a week , you know .
and the wonderful thing is that superstring theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions , but when we study superstring theory , we find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling , new form .
and that &apos;s dopamine-fed . and that &apos;s , &quot; i must have this one person . &quot;
and i just feel , at last , one with the stick and one with the drum .
and since we &apos;ve already had so many problems with police use of non-lethal weapons in various ways , i thought it would be a really good idea to look at some of those things and try to relate it to the military context .
being a journalist , after terence died , i wrote a book , &quot; the cost of hope . &quot;
they &apos;re very low to the water , and they &apos;re all uninhabited , except one island has about 35 caretakers on it .
so here i had this falcon , and it was lovely . it looked really great , the light worked on it really well , it was better than anything that i could achieve or obtain out in the world .
it had &apos; chad &apos; written in magic marker on it .
when i see objects , i imagine them in motion .
but on that mountain where we gain that beautiful peace of mind , what are we really achieving ?
all of industry was in play , as investors flocked to place their bets .
they &apos;ll pop it back on and fix the scratch later .
i hope this worries you , by the way -- when you go to see your physician .
now , you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo .
and what &apos;s more , your wife has just run off with your best friend . &quot;
it &apos;s extremely inexpensive and rechargeable every five years .
we have to keep everything under control .
so there &apos;s another function on here .
we tried to do the same thing by negotiating industry-right deals with the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric and other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools .
they don &apos;t employ those workers .
and i &apos;m applying a similar trick to say , what if we looked at the universe in our culture through the eyes of technology ? what does technology want ?
vusi mahlasela : &quot; thula mama &quot;
and this booking is within all the parameters for each individual .
we actually drilled holes into the ice , way deep down below the thawing level , and had some cameras out there for the past month and a half or so .
so i think half of my book advance went into sunscreen .
and so they started following and watching petty thefts , summonses , all kinds of things -- charting the future essentially .
so now , look at inner conditions . aren &apos;t they stronger ?
no one is better at this activity of actually getting us to engage in delivering services , sometimes where none exist , than ushahidi .
there &apos;s a very short list of these places .
he was a master mechanic , and he taught me how to use tools .
it almost made me feel a little bit guilty about having an uplifting talk about the future .
but he said , &quot; we will partner with you , but we &apos;re not going to invest in it . you need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work . &quot;
in fact , you could be in a bottle with a cap on top , and you would not die at all , and you would not need any fresh air .
so , for example , they can say their work is available freely for non-commercial , this amateur-type of use , but not freely for any commercial use .
well i think back to my childhood , a good part of which i spent , after being born here in chicago , i spent in europe .
in the economic system in traditional africa , the means of production is privately owned .
almost like a ghost , isn &apos;t it , huh ?
we studied the winds and the sun to make sure everybody in the city will have fresh air , fresh water and direct sunlight in every single apartment at some point during the day .
what i then saw in this little moving blue dot was the potential for chaos .
it turned out it was quite clever because deep blue , in a company like bmw , has a hook -- &quot; deep blue , &quot; wow , cool name .
so a big disclaimer is put on everything that i do , and i made narratives about all the european or brit celebrities and comments about our public figures .
you know , you can tell -- and i think when we &apos;re getting into collective play , its really important for groups to gain a sense of safety through their own sharing of play signals .
but , as a cancer doc , this is what i see .
i then thought it would be years before we &apos;d be able to make it really , really useful .
marriage-manual author and semen-sniffer theodoor van de velde -- has a line in his book .
well , the evidence is , unfortunately , ample .
and this is the water feeler .
paul steinhardt , a physicist from new york , and aranda / lasch , architects , collaborated in an installation in london at the serpentine .
this little squid is called the fire shooter now it may look like a tasty morsel , or a pig &apos;s head with wings -- but if it &apos;s attacked , it puts out a barrage of light -- in fact , a barrage of photon torpedoes .
go a couple generations forward to where we are , though , and it looks like a completely different world .
and that brings me to another aspect of this , which is , to whom should this get paid ?
and since i don &apos;t like to travel alone , they also invited my daughter , son-in-law and granddaughter , so we had a lovely trip to see russia today , which is not a very pleasant and happy view .
bp obviously has a bit more on their mind now .
some abilities , of course , decrease with age .
but there &apos;s a fourth thing .
can we map that space , using the language of neutrinos or cosmic rays , taking the bounding condition of the body as its limit , but in complete reversal of , in a way , the most traditional greek idea of pointing ?
so the obvious thing for me to talk about today is graphics and audio .
to you and me , that &apos;s a heart attack .
and for three months out of the year , the surface temperatures go up to 150 to 180 .
this is a little company that &apos;s done very well with simplicity and elegance .
it means that i can take these two identical squares , and i can put them in light and dark surrounds .
it &apos;s sort of an alternative universe .
there &apos;s figs and everything else there for the taking .
i mean , we &apos;ve been doing it for two million years , so it &apos;s kind of arrogant to assume that i &apos;ve got something to say that hasn &apos;t been said and performed better a long time ago .
and you have huge differences within countries also .
we can &apos;t even afford to eat anything except beans .
there &apos;s lots of hormones . there &apos;s testosterone , adrenalin .
pick one : stand up and take three steps , or make your hands into fists , raise them over your head as high as you can for five seconds . go !
things wear out .
because there &apos;s another way of seeing it .
and that may not sound very intuitive , but let me flip over to something else you know about , and that &apos;s computers .
finally they were all arrested and taken to the drancy camp and they managed to get out at the last minute thanks to their argentinean papers .
so i went into the library to figure out how did this thing work .
i was very struck by natalie merchant &apos;s songs last night , recovering old poems .
and they &apos;ve all gone on to master &apos;s and ph.d. degrees in excellent places .
note , that when we went into libya , it was not good enough for the west to do it alone ; we had to bring others in .
it &apos;s a woman . you can see the hair .
yeah , it &apos;s a -- this one here , that &apos;s much better .
that will blow away a lot of the opposition .
i lost the fight , but probably won my life back .
i want to tell you about one family that i met , and why i think they offer clues .
because technically i &apos;ve got motors ; i &apos;ve got wheels -- i &apos;m a motor vehicle .
so , about three years ago i was in london , and somebody called howard burton came to me and said , i represent a group of people , and we want to start an institute in theoretical physics .
the service which grew out of this , dial 1298 for ambulance , with one ambulance in 2004 , now has a hundred-plus ambulances in three states , and has transported over 100,000 patients and victims since inception .
diluting it down to the point where there &apos;s none of it left .
we talked about inertia and organ donations and checking the box .
the steam engine , and the other associated technologies of the industrial revolution changed the world and influenced human history so much , that in the words of the historian ian morris , they made mockery out of all that had come before .
nine hours of feeding per day seems to be the practical limit for a primate .
that , by the way , in case you &apos;re paying attention , is not emotionally correct .
after one harvest , they had increased their income enough to buy a second system to do their full quarter-acre .
it &apos;s not interesting because it &apos;s so common .
two other things that i learned that were very surprising to me -- one was how casual we are about energy .
those pictures we use to analyze how much carbon , how the forest is developing , and we can monitor every tree using satellite images through our cooperation .
and how do we think about materials and structure , sort of as an information and computation problem ?
well it turns out that what happens is the negative data goes missing in action ; it &apos;s withheld from doctors and patients .
i &apos;ve been writing about food more or less omnivorously -- one might say indiscriminately -- for about 30 years .
and what you can see is that nearly all the spider draglines surpass them .
and people would come in and learn more about it .
this is sanghamitra .
when you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more likely to be big brother exerting more control , more secrecy , or us watching big brother , or it &apos;s just all to be played for either way ?
sousa was not a fan of the talking machines .
and since we all smell different and produce chemicals on our skin that either attract or repel mosquitos , some of us are just more attractive than others .
it &apos;s not just competitive , it &apos;s also caring .
&#91; unclear &#93; you just looked like you turned it on its end . but when you see it like that it &apos;s more interesting looking .
he actually coined the term homo sapiens -- it means wise man in latin .
my foot goes down its throat . it spits me out .
70 percent of the kids couldn &apos;t find afghanistan or iraq on a map ; 60 percent couldn &apos;t find india ; 30 percent couldn &apos;t find the pacific ocean .
it &apos;s pretty extraordinary .
and she is definitely on her way .
and they are brilliant ; it &apos;s wonderful work .
maybe i wasn &apos;t as smart , but i was at least as talkative .
this guy thought in the same way i did .
it was breathtaking .
youtube , they &apos;re putting this thing on youtube .
yes ? we heard that .
what happens when the economy recovers ?
and the reason that that &apos;s relevant is that very soon i will be walking into what we call a stage two tribe , which looks like this .
so one of the problems with these small robots is their payload carrying capacity .
and so we can send out sound waves , they bounce off objects like fish and are reflected back .
obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention .
i &apos;m going to show you a couple now .
so if humans evolved as runners , if that &apos;s our one natural advantage , why are we so bad at it ? why do we keep getting hurt ?
and what we need to do now is look at the whole pacific ocean in its entirety and make a network of mpas across the pacific so that we have our world &apos;s largest ocean protected and self-sustaining over time .
what is your ideal , and also , what has been edited out ?
if they want , they can call the granny cloud .
i should be able to ask my house where my shoes are .
maybe you &apos;ve had grand plans before but stopped yourself , thinking , &quot; that &apos;s impossible , &quot; or , &quot; that costs too much , &quot; or , &quot; that won &apos;t benefit me . &quot;
shamsul wares : it was almost impossible , building for a country like ours .
but what does this mean when we have no context for what it is that we &apos;re working on , and we &apos;re just doing these little labors ?
you know , they &apos;re a step in size from the entire observable universe .
it shows these women playing with these toys .
it &apos;s just too damn hard .
what experiments would you run ?
notice that the bottles here have caps on them .
but for the most part , we &apos;ve gone from salting to exhausting .
and that message , very frankly , is valuable for society today .
those cells turn themselves over once every eight years .
he found the foster parents , and he said to them , &quot; treat this as an adoption . he &apos;s yours forever .
and kids could bring in drawings and have the store print a sugar plate for the top of their birthday cake .
thank you .
and that &apos;s what we do to all traffic survivors .
i stay . if i go , i will be killed .
well , i was a grown man who had all of these rituals , and it got so there was a throbbing , there was a ferocious fear in my head .
this market is now estimated at over 800 million dollars annually .
now , one publisher , action publishing , was willing to take that leap and trust me and to listen to what i had to say .
well the swedish students protest at this point .
we want to roll out 15 aims centers in the next five years , all over africa .
let me just show you one thing .
you don &apos;t want to tell americans , god forbid , that they have to change their lifestyle .
and each time i get done with ooh , you may say i &apos;m a dreamer but i &apos;m not the only one 222 .
this was on a monkey hunt , hunting with curare-tipped darts .
of course , the milk can is his .
you are the reason why i said yes to the invitation to come here today .
ag : every scientist will recognize that expression of despair .
i &apos;ll explain it all later , just pay attention to the number at the bottom : plus-7.68245837 minutes that will be my gift to you if i &apos;m successful in my mission .
i think it &apos;s worth the trouble because , again , it just helps us to understand .
aging : the problem is enormous , 300,000 broken hips per year ; but the solutions are extraordinary , and they include so many different things .
assumption number one in the food industry used to be that the way to find out what people want to eat -- what will make people happy -- is to ask them .
what if we combined it with this ?
so it &apos;s actually a multi-dimensional user interface .
no matter how you do that , you &apos;re not going to start with a 100,000-dollar instrument and bring it down to no-cost . it isn &apos;t going to work .
and this is actually how a cancer goes from being harmless to deadly .
so you can &apos;t make it too simple .
what &apos;s great about this is , the tools to do this are free .
and stop where you want .
i like &quot; climate crisis &quot; instead of &quot; climate collapse , &quot; but again , those of you who are good at branding , i need your help on this .
he &apos;s already at war with the iranians , with the king of persia .
this is actually a spanish quarry , which sort of inspired the kind of spaces that these galleries could be .
for this to work , this progress must be sustainable .
i learned about ordinary people who could be heroes .
what if we had a very low commitment , but delivered something individually unique to each person who contributed ?
but things are also changing at a very rapid pace .
so they &apos;re simple building blocks .
&quot; connected &quot; is a collaboration with choreographer gideon obarzanek .
but mary went further .
the game was helping us experience what scientists call post-traumatic growth , which is not something we usually hear about .
and this is what it is .
we paid two to three times more than anybody else .
leslie byrne , a democrat from virginia , describes that when she went to congress , she was told by a colleague , &quot; always lean to the green . &quot;
even though , quite frankly , some of your presentations are horrifying , absolutely horrifying .
in a recent study , the evidence has shown that income is the greatest determinant of how long a democracy can last .
let me give you the example .
when i was sleeping , with a tripod and a timer .
we &apos;re getting tired of it . it &apos;s kind of cliched now .
so what &apos;s going on ?
and as you get to the very bottom , you &apos;re faced with the unfortunate reality that if you don &apos;t save anything for retirement , you won &apos;t be able to afford any housing at all .
and that turns into the title of my first book , &quot; inversions . &quot;
and if you think this is absurd , it &apos;s not .
there are kunskapsskolan schools in sweden .
you add all this up together and of course people are apathetic .
and i think this applies across a very broad -- sort of , a lot of concepts .
that &apos;s me , getting a nasal lavage .
nathaniel kahn shares clips from his documentary &quot; my architect , &quot; about his quest to understand his father , the legendary architect louis kahn . it &apos;s a film with meaning to anyone who seeks to understand the relationship between art and love .
this is the subjective height -- the height you saw of these guys at various points .
and i was just like , &quot; yeah , i guess i am .
and this hallucinatory drawing shows you -- everything you see in this drawing is iluvatar .
from over 12,000 civilians deliberately killed in civil wars in 1997 and 1998 , a decade later , this figure stands at 4,000 .
there &apos;s somebody hiding behind there pulling the strings , whether it &apos;s the illuminati or the bilderbergers .
ladies and gentlemen , i made a different choice .
invest sustainably . majora mentioned this .
and whether you become happy or not depends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch .
this is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity in the global phase of sustainability .
so , at 2.3 billion dollars before the first ball was bowled .
time after time , whenever i set out to share some great truth with a soon-to-be grateful recipient , it had the opposite effect .
but experimental science had been tied up with all those things .
it has an urge , and technology has an urge .
and there , for the first time , i encountered the other religious traditions : judaism and islam , the sister religions of christianity .
it &apos;s not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women .
so , we really will continue to focus on products .
this is more than 10,000 feet higher than the previous world &apos;s altitude record held by the sr-71 blackbird .
anybody who &apos;s over 15 doesn &apos;t know what this means , because in the last 10 years , the number of elementary school classroom teachers has been cut in half .
they first taught us about ecology in the context of natural resources .
in mexico , nike has run a campaign recently called , literally , bid your sweat .
so let me end with just a few words about applications that we &apos;ve found for this .
out of this rubble of haiti and from this devastation came something that we call tera -- the trilogy emergency response application -- which has been used to support the aid effort ever since .
he took apart the archimedes manuscript and the other seven manuscripts .
it &apos;s become this intense industrialized zone .
but in reality , it is managed by and for those who have the resources to go out and exploit it .
so i had 50 overall summaries done .
and it turns out there &apos;s one way .
there was a very important study done a while ago at princeton theological seminary that speaks to why it is that when all of us have so many opportunities to help , we do sometimes , and we don &apos;t other times .
and i of course knew stuff , as a designer , about typography , even though we worked with those animals not so successfully .
what this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating .
and by the way , we should point out that this was not a big meaning .
so that &apos;s all that happens .
so , you &apos;re calling for a global ethic .
we shopped double coupons and layaway and consignment stores , and when she got sick with stage four breast cancer and could no longer work , we even applied for food stamps .
but unless you learn how to mix hard power with soft power into strategies that i call smart power , you &apos;re not going to deal with the new kinds of problems that we &apos;re facing .
in the stomach , the eggs went on to develop into tadpoles , and in the stomach , the tadpoles went on to develop into frogs , and they grew in the stomach until eventually the poor old frog was at risk of bursting apart .
you &apos;re just one of the people who hasn &apos;t been told .
and that &apos;s the end .
and those post-it notes involve this and other proteins of its class -- so-called bromodomains .
one of the burning questions , of course , is if we go there and find life in the sub-surface , as i fully expect that we will , is that a second genesis of life ?
it has nothing to do with the fact that i was born there , of course .
and i thought it might serve as a kind of permanent mnemonic device .
probably , it &apos;s a combination of this .
and as these dark clouds were circling me , and i was finding it really , really difficult to think of anything good , i said to myself that i really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow .
i called my friends , painted on their bodies , and had them dance in front of a painting .
and we see these gravitational lensing effects , these distortions that say that , again , clusters are embedded in dark matter .
and the third thing : it &apos;s a symbol of his influence .
but this phenomenal project &apos;s been happening .
so i start with the ace -- yeah , ace . ah , yeah -- spades ?
so in origami , to obey these laws , we can take simple patterns -- like this repeating pattern of folds , called textures -- and by itself it &apos;s nothing .
that became , as it were , a way of confronting large businesses in the business of wasting food , and exposing , most importantly , to the public , that when we &apos;re talking about food being thrown away , stuff that &apos;s beyond the pale .
it &apos;s the achingly sentimental yearning for times that never happened .
or we can use cells alone , either your very own cells or different stem cell populations .
now , the fundamental basis of neoclassical economics would tell you it &apos;s irrational to reject a dollar because someone you don &apos;t know in another room is going to get 99 .
i do speak to sex workers , 15,000 of them for this particular slide , and this is what sex workers say they earn in an hour .
and so , in 2004 , they commissioned us to do a screen test of benjamin .
as designers , we need to be able to transition in and out of play also .
now we actually have been doing it for a long time .
and one afternoon , i got a call from my doctor .
now , we know that that &apos;s wrong .
you have to go to the literature and look up what &apos;s known about feet .
this is benki .
who is going to raise their hand and say , &quot; i want to hear what you &apos;re doing next , &quot; and sell something to them .
i mean this quite seriously .
the biggest challenge is that material science is complex and requires expensive equipment .
so encouraging people to actually go online and share information and data on blogs and wikis is great because otherwise , low level apparatchiks and bureaucrats will continue concealing what &apos;s actually happening in the country , right ?
and that means the complete cycle of coming from inside , out to the physical , to someone perceiving it .
much later , robert maillart &apos;s bridges , which optimize structural form with a calculus curvature almost like a parabola .
when you multiply that by all the nurses in all the wards in 40 hospitals in the system , it resulted , actually , in a pretty big impact .
what we &apos;re told in terms of arguments against leaving this country is that the fate of the women is primary .
then there are other things that don &apos;t cost much and achieve absolutely nothing .
so they had created these artifacts .
i made a promise to her grandmother , your mother , that i would find a family , and now i &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re going to take care of her . &quot;
so i believe that we have an ethic that the earth grows our food , and we need to move to an ethic in this century that the earth should grow our homes .
as you know , it &apos;s not going to turn out well .
i almost couldn &apos;t finish it .
you &apos;ll notice , of course , that there are hot spots -- south asia , africa .
will eventually joined a gang and committed a number of very serious crimes , including , most seriously of all , a horrible , tragic murder .
and i had an armored organization at that point .
this is an area thought to be involved in expressive communication .
my family &apos;s living in the hilton hotel in scotts valley .
so let me go on the next short video .
but it doesn &apos;t count the health of our children or the integrity of our public officials .
but the pleasure and the passion and the joy is still there .
beautiful , because it has symmetry .
and i described to them some of these lego experiments , and they said they felt like they had just been through that experiment .
they were saying , &quot; this is explicitly intended to give police an option between shouting and shooting .
he said , &quot; well , you just bend time and space , it takes an awful lot of energy , and that &apos;s just how you do it . &quot;
and you know some of them would probably be terrible chairs .
some pundit with too much time on his hands has reckoned that the new experiments are approximately 100 trillion times better than they were in 1960 , 100 trillion times better .
we spend 100 billion dollars a year on diet aids .
it &apos;s usually some kind of choice between the vocational and the intellectual .
every day , all of us here , we &apos;re building gods that have gone rampant , and it &apos;s time we started knocking them down and forgetting their names .
they tell us to have a bath .
let me just ask you one question first .
and i think this is beginning to happen in the entertainment business .
basically , a human body is a conversation going on , both within the cells and between the cells , and they &apos;re telling each other to grow and to die , and when you &apos;re sick , something &apos;s gone wrong with that conversation .
the global economic financial crisis has reignited public interest in something that &apos;s actually one of the oldest questions in economics , dating back to at least before adam smith .
and it was a funny kind of sick feeling , but i turned him down .
because architecture is also the asking of questions .
and this is what we spend a lot of our time doing , is just making sure that we can keep up with this kind of traffic load .
and i &apos;m really excited about this , because it &apos;s a very compact core .
but well done , him .
so just to take some quick examples : people text or do email during corporate board meetings .
if we look at the data , we can see that the answer to that question is , mmm .
and that will happen , paradoxically -- everything you hear about global warming -- when we hit co2 down to 10 parts per million , we are no longer going to have to have plants that are allowed to have any photosynthesis , and there go animals .
so , completely irrational , you would think .
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been building the suburbs with a lot of unintended consequences .
charles hazlewood : trusting the ensemble
he was saving lives with this machine .
so this is the story of bread as we know it now .
so i can determine , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re excited or whether you &apos;re aroused , or not , ok ?
eventually , it will be able to have to stay up day , night , day , night , for six months at a time , acting like the synchronous satellite , but only ten miles above the earth .
this becomes an isosceles triangle -- again , very shaky .
and four years later , as i said , it &apos;s been seen by four ...
so i feel that we have a bio-ethical imperative .
right ? so this is the first example .
the illiteracy rate in china among this generation is under one percent .
i think that means doodling is native to us and we simply are denying ourselves that instinct .
actually , the idea came out of an argument that i had at starbucks , that i insisted that i wasn &apos;t having colombian coffee ; the coffee was actually pre-columbian .
his counterpart is not college-educated and works as a laborer , works as a clerk , does low-level white collar or blue collar work in the economy .
can you imagine your world without it ?
so three questions i &apos;d offer you .
there are common elements of this that you &apos;ll see throughout chicago , and then there are your big-d design statements : the pritzker pavilion done by frank gehry .
now this is a tactic that patent trolls are supposed to use on people to get their way .
but when it &apos;s moving back and forth , the retina picks up these changes .
so that christmas -- maybe i &apos;ve got time for this -- that christmas i got the mister wizard fun-o-rama chemistry set .
we have to understand why people are not saving , and then we can hopefully flip the behavioral challenges into behavioral solutions , and then see how powerful it might be .
if you look at the last 35 years and different social transitions from dictatorship to democracy , you will see that out of 67 different cases , in 50 of these cases it was nonviolent struggle which was the key power .
because the more things that are familiar , the more things my hands know how to do , the more things that i can be happy and busy doing when my brain &apos;s not running the show anymore .
this is an un-retouched -- this is not a joke -- un-retouched photo of microsoft word , the copy that you have , with all the toolbars open .
but these clinics have treated tens of thousands of patients to date , many of them children , and spect imaging involves a radioactive injection , so exposing people to radiation , potentially harmful .
what is the exact relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and planetary temperatures ?
as far as we know , evidence to discover the most fundamental truths of all the sciences is here just for the taking on our planet .
but you don &apos;t want to get all of the insects .
it &apos;s our prejudgment that it &apos;s underground .
we have to turn that around .
and so you see this whole society getting frustrated about losing some of its mobility .
was to adopt a very classical model of fear .
you can see from the slide , very very strong .
every day , 24 hours , that pump is at your side , administering medicine directly to your heart , and it &apos;s not a particularly preferable medicine in many senses .
the earliest cell phones , the earliest personal computers were invented in the 1970s .
marvin minsky : health and the human mind
and this is where it gets really interesting , because it &apos;s not that simple , because we are not simple .
all the grayed-out species disappear .
you can also see the evolution of the one-child-only policy as it travels through the bloodline .
and so education needs to work by pull , not push .
they wished they &apos;d not packed rice .
i &apos;ve spent most of my professional life researching media and entertainment and its impact on people &apos;s lives .

there is something more though that has to be there .
like i said , pollen carries the male sex cells .
it &apos;s called the standard model -- beautifully simple mathematical equation .
and we have to realize that we are all going to into this , down to here .

and if a cloud goes past , you can see a cloud on the tips where it &apos;s letting the light through .
i thought narcissism meant you loved yourself .
and that led me to this project .
so i think , yes , there may be ways that non-lethal weapons are going to be great in these situations , but there &apos;s also a whole heap of problems that need to be considered as well .
so , i started out in &apos; 95 with this exhibition that was called mutant materials in contemporary design .
and that changed everything for me . it was totally life changing .
could we have fuel without fear ?
six to eight months , they &apos;re totally equivalent .
the international cat video film festival didn &apos;t have that much of a reaction .
she reaches into her purse and hands him a 20 .

they were killing people . they were doing whatever they want because they have power .
we &apos;ve driven in cities , like in san francisco here .
so , for example , if i was angry and had to hide it , which i often did , being very adept at concealing how i really felt , then the voice would sound frustrated .

we &apos;ve got plenty of these things .
this is a social map of the hijackers and their associates who perpetrated the 9 / 11 attack .
this has come &apos; round to be that all those naked pachyderms have aquatic ancestors .
they &apos;re encoded in the dna .
and i said , &quot; shallow affect : an inability to experience a range of emotions . &quot;
so he &apos;s got memory .
ten million americans already have this for one reason or another , but really worryingly , 16 percent -- roughly one in six -- of american teenagers suffer from noise-induced hearing disorder as a result of headphone abuse .
because if we can do that , if we can actually just collect the data electronically , digitally , from the very beginning , we can just put a shortcut right through that whole process of typing , of having somebody type that stuff into the computer .
we hope that all of you will come to see the allosphere .
the hard problem that alice chose was the rising incidence of childhood cancers .
when public sector debt is low , governments don &apos;t have to choose between investing in education and health and paying interest on that debt you owe .
there are microbes which , through their metabolism , produce hydrogen sulfide , and they do so in large amounts .
all i know is how to make refrigerators . &quot;
maybe you think about the tragically boring board games that hold us hostage in thanksgiving situations .
that was our hf radio antenna .
i want to show you some moments of history in my journey , which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world .
rd : yeah ?
biology -- we have co-adapted through biology to like bright colors .
janet echelman found her true voice as an artist when her paints went missing -- which forced her to look to an unorthodox new art material . now she makes billowing , flowing , building-sized sculpture with a surprisingly geeky edge . a transporting 10 minutes of pure creativity .
here you see a patent for an arm in 1912 .
do you remember what it was ?
she did it because she ran a country that had a national health service .
and hopefully in the next five years , i &apos;ll be giving you a tedtalk on that .
of course we don &apos;t .
we just need you to be authentic and real and say , &quot; we &apos;re sorry .
it turns out that , in fact , the world was given this gift in 1738 by a dutch polymath named daniel bernoulli .
that &apos;s before we got up to the four bucks a gallon .
suppose the rules are : every time you offer somebody a drink , you give them the drink , and you give them your styrofoam peanuts too .
audience : 93 .
because i tried to make it intimate .
i mean , these are state assets .
so the next time that one called i let him get halfway through his spiel and then i said , &quot; you sound sexy . &quot;
delusions and hallucinations are hallmarks of the illness .
if a child soils its nappy at 8 : 30 , he will have to wait several hours before it can be changed again .
now , my breakthrough came in a very unlikely place , possibly the most unlikely place for innovation : my high school biology class , the absolute stifler of innovation .
so this work is nothing but like -- because of the focal length of the lens , it just shows what is on the other side .
and it turns out that different things crystallize out at different stages .
we saw how ps 234 worked .
now you might wonder , how can people fit in a tiny village only this big ?
however , to me , the 500 is really just the first 500 .
and aren &apos;t we grateful for our brains that can , you know , take this electrical impulse that comes from light energy to create images in order for us to explore our world ?
the sun burns our peripheral vision .
so i cold-called the ceo of prostate cancer canada , and i said to him , &quot; i have this most amazing concept . &quot;
there &apos;s a clock , clock , clock , clock .
by month 12 , we could argue whether there &apos;s a little bit of material around the edges , but it &apos;s essentially completely gone .
now , that &apos;s a great idea , but what i &apos;d like to say is that , in fact , this is a great metaphor for the way that ideas happen .
we wanted to know if what is being done is effective .
and we &apos;re a pretty small staff , which is me .
but then i started thinking about my family .
high pressure builds over india .
now , the africa progress panel , led by kofi annan , they &apos;ve calculated that congo may have lost more than 1.3 billion dollars from these deals .
and we don &apos;t have any industry at all -- it &apos;s only because of this deforestation .
and i went off on assignment and came back a week later , and father keene said , &quot; i &apos;ve got to talk to you about hyun-sook . &quot;
i &apos;ll let you hear a sample of that voice .
now i &apos;m going to show you this in 3d .
but at any rate , they are there .
and i will try and explain to you what &apos;s wrong with this notion .
if you take this thing , you know very well it weighs very little .
but that &apos;s not the prime candidate for life in the solar system .
by expressing it as an if-then statement , you can get the message across without appearing to boss another person around .
proteins are targets for drugs .
here you &apos;re looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe and you &apos;re seeing billions of galaxies , right , and nodes , but you realize they &apos;re not even the main structure .
this lady , she developed a herbal pesticide formulation .
we see that there is no quick fix .
even the sutherlands told me that they had an agile thanksgiving , where you had one group of people working on the food , one setting the table , and one greeting visitors at the door .
why is it that martin luther king led the civil rights movement ?
how clever would we have to be ?
our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each , on minute timescales .
some people actually come back and say , &quot; oh , you want to screw me . let me show you what i can do . &quot;
or are there contexts where we &apos;re far better off taking the passenger &apos;s seat and have someone else drive ?
thanks for having me .
and not works for the left or the right , but works for the left and the right , the citizens of the left and right , because there is no sensible reform possible until we end this corruption .
krista donaldson : the $ 80 prosthetic knee that &apos;s changing lives
for reversing disease , that &apos;s what it takes , but if you &apos;re just trying to be healthy , you have a spectrum of choices .
because i realized that nature had invented reproduction as a mechanism for life to move forward , as a life force that passes right through us and makes us a link in the evolution of life .
i had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak , looking like the michelin man .
so rovs aren &apos;t new .
jl : i won &apos;t use them . thank you .
the first two are shared with many , many other species , and they are really coming out largely of the brain stem and whatever there is of cortex in those species .
this material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true .
please join us in this epic adventure .
but remember , the people in baghdad , the people in iraq , the people in afghanistan -- they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day .
321 is 103,041 . 103,041 .
and they &apos;re now fully capable of handling any of the loads you would see in flight -- just like putting down your convertible top .
now some of you might actually right now be thinking , it &apos;s downright crazy to have 10 tedtalks summarized into just six words .
diane downs : at night when i close my eyes , i can see christie reaching her hand out to me while i &apos;m driving , and the blood just kept coming out of her mouth .
there is the orange system .
i believe this is going to democratize health care .

five years later , those women lived twice as long , and you can see that the people -- and that was the only difference between the groups .
this film shows the testing of a new explosive fill on a warhead .
so i can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fresh perspective and see if i can optimize it in its most idealistic fashion .
and it began when i flew back from london after my time at the u.n. in kosovo .
now , the shortcut .
mtv europe worked with us and made that spoof , and they &apos;ve been slipping it in between music videos without any introduction , which i think is kind of fun .
this experience of working with duke also led me to initiate a program called sound science .
we can &apos;t sustain this without the measure of our success really changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red .
but he was , in fact , a moral philosopher , and he was right on why we &apos;re moral .
but the interesting thing is , of those three , india &apos;s looking real good , as you just saw in the data .
here &apos;s the virgin mary on the backside , which they started to wipe off .
the split starts to emerge between those in the military who see a future they can live with , and those who see a future that starts to scare them , like the u.s. submarine community , which watches the soviet navy disappear overnight .
in this map from moldova , the green color shows those districts that have low spending on schools but good educational outcomes , and the red color shows the opposite .
there are all these different things for us to get the data that we need to do .
it &apos;s little discrete -- that &apos;s spelled d-i-s-c-r-e-t-e -- bits .
it happens when i dance , when i &apos;m acting .
i &apos;m a storyteller .
this room may appear to be holding 600 people , but there &apos;s actually so many more , because in each one of us there is a multitude of personalities .
there were 20 ph.d. &apos; s plus me and the professor crammed into this tiny office space with them firing these rapid-fire questions at me , trying to sink my procedure .
and when we said to our parents and grandparents , &quot; how would you feel if tomorrow morning you woke up black ? &quot;
and i think that institutions should stand up and release all their data under unrestricted licenses , and it would be a great benefit to everybody .
the second school i was at had big trees too , had a fantastic tulip tree , i think it was the biggest in the country , and it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation around it , around the playing fields .
it &apos;s the kind of original movement for any puppet for us onstage .
shea hembrey : how i became 100 artists
and here &apos;s the peeling action of the mecho-gecko .
she picks the water up from there , desalinates it , for free , transports it over there , and dumps it onto the mountains , rivers , and streams .
so , because nobody in their straight mind would row straight past hawaii without dropping in , i decided to cut this very big undertaking into three segments .
it &apos;s a full spectrum of tools .
plan b appeared in its first full-blown form in 1998 -- something called the digital millennium copyright act .
very soon we will all be dead and gone , but the problems will stay , unless we have people taking over from where we stopped .
to say ahh , if this happens then we are going to have a pandemic ?
so , everyone told me afterwards that inviting the prospective parents over was , again , the stupidest thing i could have possibly done , because who &apos;s ever good enough for your relative ?
he mumbled something about his mother , and i told him she &apos;d probably find him outside anyway .
she &apos;s 16 years old .
so that is the house of tata .
and that means that if we want to avail ourselves of it , we &apos;re allowed to postulate chemical events in the origin of life which have a probability as low as one in 100 billion billion .
you can &apos;t just look at the dessert cart as say , &quot; no , no , no . that looks disgusting to me . &quot;
volcanoes erupt .
and that was , of course , the very common story .
and this is all big raised platform .
school -- and remember , i made it through one year , so i think i &apos;m qualified to talk on school -- is a game , it &apos;s just not a terribly well-designed game , right .
john q. walker : great piano performances , recreated
my colleagues and i have been working for 10 years to rediscover this lost world in a project we call the mannahatta project .
what about a wolf ?
and then it bursts into a forest of redwoods .
well my personal story , my personal journey , what brings me to the ted stage here today , is a demonstration of exactly what &apos;s been happening in muslim-majority countries over the course of the last decades , at least , and beyond .
when we look at a map of los angeles or london , it is hard to believe that as of 2005 , only 15 percent of the world was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail .
and we thought it had something to do with this protein called amp kinase , an energy protein .
why would daddy bring elder revels ?
i see a lot of hands coming down .
and the way i look at it is : if you don &apos;t have knives and forks in your school , you &apos;re purely endorsing , from a state level , fast food , because it &apos;s handheld .
and we helped him build a company , for profit , that would build on ide &apos;s knowledge , and start looking at sales and exports , and be able to tap into other kinds of capital .
who &apos;s going after chinese , which now has 400 million internet users out there ?
it is about action .
and i plan to start from a cliff , like catapulted from a cliff .
and so this is one of the great challenges that is going to happen .
so now the next question you may have is , well why can &apos;t we just pay people to do this ?
we felt like we were surrogate parents .
you may not appreciate the person , you may not appreciate anything else , but maybe you appreciate the fact that they &apos;ve got a tough gig .
this is like -- it feels like the united nations just here .
and he says , &quot; well i used to be a banker and now i &apos;m a gold miner . &quot;
it &apos;s called an allele .
and i &apos;m like , knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all a &apos;s .
they will completely lose .
the first is -- death is a big problem .
if they won &apos;t submit , kill them .
sometimes these pieces are mathematical , in that way that i look at a shape and say , what about if i use this and this and this .
but again , that only shows part of the picture .
that &apos;s what i wanted to do .
there &apos;s no manual . this is exactly what you expect , especially if you haven &apos;t interacted with a computer before .
we can &apos;t see into the engine room .
and i &apos;ll just say what i &apos;m about to do . what i &apos;m about to do -- i hope you can recognize that there &apos;s a distorted sine wave , almost a triangular wave upon this hewlett-packard oscilloscope .
and the birds on the floor tend to have lower pitched calls , so that they don &apos;t get distorted when they bounce off the forest floor .
in fact , i &apos;ve heard it said in the disability community that there are really only two types of people : there are those with disabilities , and there are those that haven &apos;t quite found theirs yet .
now , when you think of a coral reef , this is what most people think of : all these big , hard , elaborate corals and lots of bright , colorful fishes and things .
when we landed on the drop-zone , everything had changed .
for example , a trillion dollars of real estate remains uncapitalized in india alone .
so i went to cambridge , because it was really the best place in the world then for x-ray crystallography . and x-ray crystallography is now a subject in , you know , chemistry departments .
in the cities , a lot of the cost of property is actually wrapped up in its speculative value .
this is what &apos;s called a hydrothermal vent .
i wanted a pure thing , and i can &apos;t get it .
thank you .
i parked a different place every night so i would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police .
50 percent of the women accused me of playing a trick , of putting the same color nail polish in both those bottles .
i was having my inscriptions , my admission to biology .
because they &apos;re focused on honoring what is most beautiful about our past and building it into the promise of our future .
that &apos;s my question .
a mexican composer : arturo marquez .
it &apos;s pretty annoying for the fishermen .
so , it &apos;s not quite as good as you might think , you might hope .
i &apos;d like to share with you the story of one of my patients called celine .
and these can be things that maybe you &apos;re already doing .
there &apos;s self-acceptance , there &apos;s family acceptance , and there &apos;s social acceptance .
bf : up and over his shoulders .
and it gets quiet .
and the organisms , i promise you , have all of their priorities in order .
it &apos;s beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration .
the present joins a flow of time from before and after .
well , we feel that now is the time to prove we &apos;re right .
so every grain of sand is unique . every beach is different .
i didn &apos;t feel sick at all .
and something very unusual happens .
the estimated range is between 20 and 50 percent for a series of goals of biodiversity and fishery enhancement and resilience .
thank you .
and this tells me one of two things .
and that &apos;s what that moment with patricia schroeder i think shows : that if we are to bring about an end to the world &apos;s worst atrocities , we have to make it such .
and she said , &quot; no , those are the lights of key west . &quot;
technology is transforming the face of food vulnerability in places where you see classic famine .
did i know anything about this ?
this is from a global survey .
it took quite many years for the program to become what it is now .
and we would visit each other .
and with our hyper-consumption of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease , kindness might just be a bit of a red herring .
kirk citron : and now , the real news
second , the development institutions that channeled these transfers were opaque , with little transparency of what they financed or what results they achieved .
there &apos;s two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change -- so on .
this act defines what a national lottery will look like .
but the media lab is an interesting place , and it &apos;s important to me because as a student , i was a computer science undergrad , and i discovered design later on in my life .
they are not going to touch that , because it &apos;s not your matter .
so , maps of things leading to organized understandings of the universe in which we emerge .
so historically there has been a huge divide between what people consider to be non-living systems on one side , and living systems on the other side .
and this is why things don &apos;t get done at work -- it &apos;s because of the m &amp; amp ; ms.
his mother showed up the next week at my brother &apos;s classroom and begged seven-year-old kids to share with her any picture they may have of her son , for she had lost everything .
three to four feet , it might as well have been a football field away .
if that is indeed true , biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation ?
after that point , they thin out a lot .
and then what the best part is , we started getting a flood of videos in of people doing crazy things with it .
look at this thing and say , &quot; well , i didn &apos;t think i was a very good sleeper , but actually i did better than average in 50 to 60 year olds . &quot; ok ?
white-nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats .
there &apos;s many things about it . it becomes very simple , and basically what you &apos;re doing is you &apos;re just touching the machine , you &apos;re touching the cloud and you &apos;re going to compute that way .
and she said , &quot; but the thing i liked about your talk is you &apos;re a storyteller .
and it goes around and around and around , the same way that military-industrial complex worked a long time ago .
david pizarro : the strange politics of disgust
jh : it looks like we &apos;re loaded for bear here .
that after 10 years , the focus on the construction sector would have produced both jobs and , hence , security -- because young people would have jobs -- and it would have reconstructed the infrastructure .
the quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons .
and so the lesson is this : it doesn &apos;t really matter what you &apos;re selling ; you just have to think about who is your customer , and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior .
when i was a boy , in front of every house in the summer evenings , you would find young people together singing the songs of the day , or the old songs .
what is multimedia-tasking ? it &apos;s the fact that most of us , most of our children , are engaged with listening to music at the same time as they &apos;re doing search on the web at the same time as they &apos;re chatting on facebook with their friends .
in other parts of the world , you have an infrastructure that allows for manufacturing to take place .
i will try to explain to you about the context of why and when i posted .
you cannot ask people to work under these conditions .
and joe was very worried about the device that he was working on .
so if mom does put a blanket over the baby , it &apos;s still receiving effective phototherapy from below .
it &apos;s a dead world . nasa should not spend any time or effort studying mars anymore . &quot;
she only wants to spend time with her friends .
so , when i get those calls about performance , that &apos;s one thing .
the kids were amazing : extremely eager and often very bright .
this is another case where a theoretical paradigm in biology really worked -- was the germ theory of disease .
and coming back to the car , i always used to say that the car is like your mother-in-law : you have to have good relationship with her , but she cannot command your life .
this is a u.s. customs and border protection room , a contraband room , at john f. kennedy international airport .
and fraser &apos;s on his knees , arms tied behind his back , and he &apos;s crying .
and we also use functional mri , called fmri , to take a video , a movie , of brain activity when participants are taking part in some kind of task like thinking or feeling or perceiving something .
what if the sky was 41 percent gray ? wouldn &apos;t that be the perfect sky ? &quot;
the project launched in april 2005 .
now , i have to apologize to our magician friend lennart green .
but probably even more important is that the work that comes out of these years flows back into the company and into society at large , rather than just benefiting a grandchild or two .
when you look at the biggest user and the second largest user , we use 20 million barrels and the chinese use 10 .
and occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin and the two of us enjoy each other , and each one tries to get out of their own , and ultimately it fails of course , and then we &apos;re back into this thing .
the mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this , but not terribly successfully .
as his spirits sagged , his body deteriorated until , i believe , he slowly brought about his own death .
this looks nice .
i know because we have reports from seychelles , which fit in as well , down here .
third step is cognitive dissonance .
so imagine a grid , like the one i &apos;m showing you right now , and now imagine , within that grid , that two-dimensional sheet , imagine neurons .
he happened to be a birder .
but the process itself is without purpose , without foresight , without design .
this is a very good year .
well , who are we not to say this ?
there are , i don &apos;t know , some lessons from all of this , personal and political -- and in a way , they &apos;re the same thing .
to borrow a phrase from carrie fisher , which is in my bio there ; i &apos;ll just toss it out again -- &quot; these days even instant gratification takes too long . &quot;
and afrigadget is a blog that looks at technology in an africa context .
and watch it now slip , and see what it does with its tail .
therefore , any curriculum for training emotion intelligence has to begin with attention training .
in 1967 , in the middle of the biafran-nigerian civil war , dr. njoku-obi invented the cholera vaccine .
so there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now , but the problem with some of them is that they &apos;re not scientific enough .
poverty breeds despair . we know this .
laugh though you will , all the drug dealers and gang members with whom i dealt had one of these long before any police officer i knew did .
but it seems like by investigating , by attacking cancer , by searching where cancer is not , there has got to be something -- there &apos;s got to be something -- that &apos;s making this tissue resistant to tumors .
and that means that there is a one-way transfer of energy from our environment into our homes and cities .
so , it seemed that the toxin that was killing the gharial was something in the food chain , something in the fish they were eating .
and i was protecting the project from it , i realized . i was protecting it -- i didn &apos;t want this special , little group of photographs to get sullied in some way .
i was making all these scribble pictures .
but this is how we do it in the united states .
benki knew this .
when i &apos;m photographing them , i cannot help but remember my grandfather &apos;s lesson .
or , you take this particular un-retouched photograph . now , interestingly enough , i get a lot of emails from people who say , &quot; is there any perceptual difference between males and females ? &quot;
that set me on the road to examining biomechanics .
around each one of our courses , a community of students had formed , a global community of people around a shared intellectual endeavor .
audience : five . five .
this defines the imagined futures of our fellow hungarians -- robicsek , teszler and bartok -- as it does my own .
and i think , look at the tsunami , it &apos;s a classic example .
and it sounds like an easy problem .
audience : oh , 722 .
so , we &apos;re down there , and this is at 400 feet -- that &apos;s looking straight up , by the way , so you can get a sense of how far away the surface is .
since it &apos;s organic , i &apos;m really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals .
she paused and said , &quot; i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s 6,000 yuan or 6,000 american dollars , but anyway , it &apos;s 6,000 . &quot;
this is from my second book .
we self-edit as we &apos;re having ideas .
so we have to be disciplined and focus on things that are critical .
covering the tragic tune with something different , something radically different .
or wait to capture the second half of it .
isn &apos;t that cool ?
and we &apos;ve already started construction on section two .
this is about justice . really .
so i quit my degree , i headed off to the himalayas , i became a monk , and i started studying meditation .
so here is some nectar from my film .
if you go on the streets of india and china , you see this kind of stuff .
it even beeps , because it &apos;s an alarm clock , after all .
so , that &apos;s just one use . incredible , there is probably 350 , 400 uses .
now this is several years ago . adjusted for inflation , it &apos;s a decent sum of money for a few minutes of work .
and then it was only later that i realized how very similar these questions were to the ones i used to ask myself as a child frightened in the night .
it even had an offshoot running to haifa in what is today israel , on the mediterranean sea .
really , this is more about putting the player in the role of george lucas , you know ?
so with that , i &apos;ll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : geography always matters .
of course , africa is a continent full of catastrophes : there are immense ones , such as the horrific rapes in congo and depressing ones , such as the fact that 5,000 people apply for one job vacancy in nigeria .
well , i can tell you that this divergence that you &apos;re seeing here doesn &apos;t happen only in our five-minute experiment .
but with &quot; disappear , &quot; there &apos;s really no analogies -- so evan , what you want to do here is to imagine the cube slowly fading out , okay .
you start sweating to dissipate the heat that you &apos;re going to create from muscular exertion .
because this is the place if aliens land , i hope they come here .
and i don &apos;t know when or how it happened , but the speed at which i went from being a talented writer and journalist to being a homeless woman , living in a van , took my breath away .
and it would be a lovely thing to be able to wave to someone and have all our reiterations wave at the same time .
it &apos;s real , what &apos;s happening .
this is the death star .
during this 60-hour siege on mumbai , 10 men armed not just with weapons , but with technology , were able to bring a city of 20 million people to a standstill .
what you can see over here is tamara , who is holding my phone that &apos;s now plugged in .
if you &apos;ve got that , you &apos;re with me for the entire journey . okay ?
juanita is her name .
we &apos;re talking &apos; 95 now .
in a political campaign , you start with no interest and no capacity to turn that into action .
i can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are .
so what then distinguishes the israeli / palestinian conflict from that in northern ireland , or the civil war in sudan from that in liberia ?
before that , they were all soft , fluffy structures .
thank you .
thanks very much . it &apos;s been an honor .
science has the power to predict the future in many cases now .
thank you .
i control the brain in order to understand how it works .
now , when looking at africa vis-a-vis other things , and countries in africa vis-a-vis other things , comparisons become important .
the surimi sticks &#91; of &#93; crabmeat , or is being sold as crab meat , is white fish that &apos;s being dyed with cochineal .
i needed teachers , in the classroom , every day , who were going to say , &quot; you can move beyond that . &quot;

we &apos;re taking over a thousand samples for each brain .
and then , for instance , this other exhibition that was entitled workspheres in 2001 , where i asked different designers to come up with ideas for the new type of work styles that were happening in the world at that time .

anybody do any writing today ? did anybody write a word ?
so for the first time , i got invited to speak at the national parliament .
and the guy that made this , he made a slot machine out of lego .
why ? because the taliban withheld education during the period of time in which these men and women would have learned to read .
do they all get there on time ? the supply chain .
one , empire was the least original thing that the west did after 1500 .
maybe i can come back next year , or something like that .
and the next lines are , &quot; through the unknown remembered gate , where the last of earth discovered is that which is the beginning . &quot;
i won &apos;t send any more commandos in until i know it &apos;s safe .

magic isn &apos;t that intense . i have to warn you , though , if you ever play with someone who deals cards like this , don &apos;t play for money .
it &apos;s rain . africa is fertile . they can grow the crops .
and in 2008 , in chengdu , sichuan area in china , nearly 70,000 people were killed , and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor .
there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world .
so if you think of a map of your country , i think you &apos;ll realize that for every country on earth , you could draw little circles to say , &quot; these are places where good teachers won &apos;t go . &quot;
so , with all of these things put together , i think that the chances of life are much greater than i would &apos;ve ever thought .
this includes about three and a half to six years for a site permit .
some of your own regrets are also not as ugly as you think they are .
thank you .
go ahead and play this one .
it &apos;s in your tedgift bag . no , no .
it is actually a living connection to the cosmic event that we are part of , and a story that is certainly ongoing .
in 1989 , i entered the british foreign service .
you learn things unconsciously .
imagine what it means for your personal security as a heavily armed civilian population gets angrier and angrier about why this was allowed to happen .
we can &apos;t have anything to do with you . &quot;
self-control is not a problem in the future .
boyd varty : what i learned from nelson mandela
ed : awl , also , good that the leather crafter &apos;s guild is here .
so the first thing we &apos;re going to do are the things that don &apos;t require a lot of robotics .
so this project really has taken on this inner organic life of its own .
twenty-three percent said , &quot; yes , as soon as possible . &quot;
now , he tries e again . that chord doesn &apos;t work .
i see -- always , it stirs my heart -- a picture of dr. martin luther king , jr .
because our hamburger recipe , our ultimate hamburger recipe , if you make the buns and you marinate the meat and you do all this stuff , it does take about 30 hours .
if they then mixed with each other there , then those modern humans that became the ancestors of everyone outside africa carried with them this neanderthal component in their genome to the rest of the world .
and so when thomas jefferson wrote in the declaration of independence , &quot; we hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , &quot; he did not mean &quot; we hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are clones . &quot;
we could have a coast-to-coast , free wireless communication system .
at the end of that time , i went off to australia , about 20 years ago .
and if we can understand leadership like that , i think if we can redefine leadership like that , i think we can change everything .
there are other dimensions for flaps .
we should draw examples from these different illustrations , not to have diplomacy which is disconnected from people and civil society .
it &apos;s really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark and try to put a tag on it .

often , speech and thinking become disorganized to the point of incoherence .
so i am a pediatric cancer doctor and stem-cell researcher at stanford university where my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation .
now we &apos;ve talked a little bit about how to talk to someone who &apos;s lying and how to spot a lie .
why ? because as your attention shifts to your cell phone , you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly to the car braking in front of you , and so you &apos;re much more likely to get engaged into a car accident .
and i was rather taken aback .
in fact , the west has lost its work ethic .
i needed to put it into a context .
and so a year ago , i showed this off at a computer show called e3 .
but for me , the reason for this actually has to do with dogs .
so what i did , i took all those emails , and i put them together into something called angrigami , which was an origami template made out of this sort of vile stuff .
by young students from standford university on an extreme affordability project that they had , basically .
we must disenthrall ourselves , and then we shall save our country . &quot;

from the zen master seng-ts &apos;an : &quot; if you want the truth to stand clear before you , never be for or against .

theo jansen : i want to put these forms of life on the beaches .
but i felt it was too much to ask to have to adjust each individual armrest in order to get it where you wanted .

sorry , start again .
these are potential sources for high-speed data transmission .
it &apos;s hard to teach , and it &apos;s not all that easy to learn .
now , if .0001 of these cells got mutated , and .00001 got cancer , you will be a lump of cancer .
see , evolution protected us during our childbearing years and then , after age 35 or 40 or 45 , it said &quot; it doesn &apos;t matter anymore , because they &apos;ve had their progeny . &quot;
yeah , boston .

most of us -- now that the &quot; me decade &quot; is well in the past -- now we actually do this .
but at the time , that was the largest molecule of a defined structure that had been made .
and then in 2003 i started parikrma humanity foundation from my kitchen table .
and this is possible because civil society joined the companies and joined the government in the analysis of the problem , in the development of remedies , in the implementation of reforms , and then later , in the monitoring of reforms .
now , i &apos;m also really big on photography .
something like this , not very pomp , not very sophisticated , this .

they &apos;re emotional . they &apos;re aware .
it &apos;s essentially there &apos;s no sign of life from outside at all .
it just so happens that stewart &apos;s brand of funny doesn &apos;t work unless the facts are true .
we have this tendency to think that only solid , material things are really things at all . waves of electromagnetic fluctuation in a vacuum seem unreal .
and the sum looks like this .
i certainly would like to know what happened to the person who had that insight back then , if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion .
the consequence of the single story is this : it robs people of dignity .
and that changes the equation slightly , doesn &apos;t it ?
more special people , more special places .
and my timing was not great either : 2005 , when i did the atlantic , was the year of hurricane katrina .

after having spent more than a decade understanding , studying , and trying to convince policymakers and donors about what was wrong with africa &apos;s agricultural markets , i decided it was time to do something about it .
we are primates , so the correct comparison is to other primates .
and that &apos;s exactly what we did 10 years ago .
they all have the same virus , but they &apos;re different enough that there &apos;s reason to believe that they &apos;ve been independently acquired .
but i was convinced i was going to get him to buy a license plate protector .
now my place is 90,000 people who are respecting each other , who are not fighting .
we &apos;re awfully careful in the lab to try and avoid various biohazards .
for people to experience who you are .
but it &apos;s a great intention to have in a relationship .
tonight , i want to have a conversation about this incredible global issue that &apos;s at the intersection of land use , food and environment , something we can all relate to , and what i &apos;ve been calling the other inconvenient truth .
so i said to him , &quot; do you want to come with me ?
it was such a smooth ride .
and , even more luckily , the guy said that he was sorry and i bribed him for compensation money , otherwise i press charges .
this is the first stunt woman , rosie venger , an amazing woman .
bl : you see this white v-shaped mark on the back of the shrimp ?
but experts do get things wrong .
and then she looked back up and said , &quot; i would ask him to forgive me for being his mother and never knowing what was going on inside his head . &quot;
so as we continue here , i want to tell you about what this is like in factories .
now if you give the partner grapes -- the food preferences of my capuchin monkeys correspond exactly with the prices in the supermarket -- and so if you give them grapes -- it &apos;s a far better food -- then you create inequity between them .
so i &apos;m not the first to figure this out . this is a quote from brian eno : &quot; the problem with computers is that there is not enough africa in them . &quot;
and it is in the total of all those acts that the history of this generation will be written .
another reason is our american emphasis on the virtues of self-reliance and independence , so we instinctively look down on older people who are no longer self-reliant and independent .
when i was a child , i lived in california , which is , you know , mostly a very nice place to live , but for me as a child , california could also be a little scary .
compare the banker in 1900 , who really just needed a good accountant and to know who was trustworthy in the local community for paying back their mortgage .
here &apos;s the second problem : you can have 60 dollars today or 60 dollars in a month . which would you prefer ?

and we go to live concerts , and we get that as much as we can .
you know , there is some push and pull , but design is really helping define the whole experience from the inside out .
if you go back a few hundred years , all around the world it was a very closed society .
the stuff has a very short half-life , same with brain science .
it was around this time we went from 1k to 16k , which was quite the leap .
how do we put real information and real structure into new ideas , and see the world in a different way ? and it &apos;s not going to be binary code that defines the computers of the universe -- it &apos;s sort of an analog computer .
we were actually recording history .
the parents predicted the kids would say , spending more time with them .
and so , i lived in kigali for about two and a half years , doing these two things , and it was an extraordinary time in my life .
and that comes in tremendously handy , because groups are smarter than individuals .
do you feel like you &apos;re moving a thousand miles an hour ?
we felt helpless .
and i said , &quot; that &apos;s a good job . that &apos;s interesting .
lastly , you want to be the nurturing agent .
i know ; i spent a lot of my career in artificial intelligence , trying to build machines that could do some of this thinking for us , that could give us answers .
once you get the formula right you can replicate it .
so the wings have their own parachute , and you have your two parachutes .
this is the outcome from a patient perspective -- same day after the treatment .
ed : all right . now last week , when i did this , you had me measure that spot to the right .

this is a picture here taken from orbit .
where they have the same kind of security to take risks .
well , let &apos;s first look at the probability -- and this is very , very difficult to estimate -- but there have been only four studies on this in recent years , which is surprising .

the woman paid him no heed .
it is so big , they have taxis in the mall .
these guys can tell us .

you , like the people that are trapped in my work — — have become part of my work as well .
and the landscape was always made by this sort of weird , uneasy collaboration between nature and man .
guess what ?
the reason is kurdistan .
i tend to win those arguments , because i know the tricks .
those were three things that i stuck with pretty closely all the time .

luckily , those patents did not exist everywhere .
and the deal that they strike is the extracting country gives kiribati five percent of the landed value .
this is the second generation . it &apos;s going to be in flash .
they don &apos;t shy away from infrastructure .

our idea of mobility is trying to make the connections between all the systems .
thanks .
now this is a totally reasonable assumption , given that i have made quite a habit of encouraging people to spend more time playing games .

so as we think about power in this century , we want to get away from this view that it &apos;s all i win , you lose .
regulate , regulate , regulate .
and social business needs markets , and there are some issues for which you just can &apos;t develop the kind of money measures that you need for a market .

i suffered through spanish for junior high , first year of high school , and the sum total of my knowledge was pretty much , &quot; donde esta el bano ? &quot;
salmon sharks aren &apos;t the only sharks we tag .
and as we think about that , let &apos;s take inspiration from the absolutely amazing capabilities of the human body and the human mind .
then , after some moments , you just go a little back , and then it starts burning .
and this was an important thing about 19th century technology , that all these relationships among parts could make the most brilliant idea fall apart , even when judged by the most expert people .
here &apos;s lesson number one .
i thought there were them and there were us , and i was not one of them .
now broadmoor is broadmoor hospital .
you have your interpretation . we have ours .

this is something i call the 50-20 paradox .
the gray dots have grown exponentially .

a classic example is james hansen , a nasa climatologist pushing for 350 parts per million carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
the sense of , you know , life could be better , i could join this -- i could be a perfect person , i could join this perfect world .
and they look something like this .
gregory petsko : the coming neurological epidemic
and that was : what is the purpose of this ?
kb : now , anything coming at all ?
and we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends .
because one thing he did know , that when fathers are connected to their children , it is less likely that they will return .

in what i call the flushed-and-plumbed world that most of us in this room are lucky to live in , the most common symptoms associated with those diseases , diarrhea , is now a bit of a joke .

there &apos;s my very own saturn v.
jf : and before leaving , we would like to show you another kind of mathematical problem that some of the boys have worked out in their spare time , in a less serious vein , for a sunday afternoon .

this happens 160 times per second , and if anything fails in this process , rezero would immediately fall to the ground .
stars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together .
so this is one of our experiments .
i call this &quot; groundswell collaborative consumption . &quot;
but even as morality binds people together into a unit , into a team , the circling blinds them .
and it certainly was .

these never really caught on either : the electric shoe warmer and drier . never a big seller .
so i &apos;ve looked at about 70 of these .
there is a profound need to belong .
it &apos;s really only a successful escape .
and then , the most important thing is , it gives us large math for low cost .

we got an inside look at the gang , from the very bottom up to the very top .
and sometimes just taking an interest in the individual , in the fellows you &apos;ve met , and the businesspeople you &apos;ve met , it can make a huge difference , especially in africa , because usually the individual in africa carries a lot of people behind them .

which was a very good thing , providing low cost clothing .
all we have to do is go around and sample , dig into the ground , find those bugs , sequence them , correlate them to the kinds of characteristics we like and don &apos;t like -- that &apos;s just a big database -- and then fertilize .

you pick them up , and once you see something that you &apos;re interested in , the staff person can scan them in and then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store .
so it &apos;s not just about the number of people ; the system itself creates a disincentive to conserve because you can lose your water right if you don &apos;t use it .

he was struggling to explain something to me : a beautiful experiment that uses lasers to cool down matter .
it &apos;s a hard problem because the water sloshes about , but it can do it .
in 1990 , she was asked this question .

it &apos;s very powerful work .
why are statisticians not measuring these ?
it &apos;s because of curtis cooper that we know , currently the largest prime number we know , is 2 ^ 57,885,161 .
so the human brain is larger than it should be , it uses much more energy than it should , so it &apos;s special .
to one group he said , &quot; i &apos;m going to time you to establish norms , averages for how long it typically takes someone to solve this sort of problem . &quot;

and the real tragedy was , if you look through her records , she had been seen in four or five other health care institutions in the preceding two years .
and i used to be one , so there .
iceland &apos;s a nordic country , so , like norway , it &apos;s able to tap into the system .

it &apos;s one of my favorite bathing suits .
well no , not pieces of plastic , but stone seals , copper tablets , pottery and , surprisingly , one large sign board , which was found buried near the gate of a city .

well , it uses it to defend itself from its predators .
feel free to survey me if that helps .
we then gave them the choice between number three and number four .
at the beginning , it can &apos;t walk at all , but it will get better and better over time .
but this is not just about students sitting alone in their living room working through problems .
the reason it &apos;s different is that , just in the past few years , our machines have started demonstrating skills they have never , ever had before : understanding , speaking , hearing , seeing , answering , writing , and they &apos;re still acquiring new skills .
it starts with a foundation , basic skills .
there is so much diversity around the globe .
the vast majority of economists -- it is so uncool to call yourself an ideologue of either camp .
and the very next shot , right after this -- so you can see what i was doing .

if they &apos;d been observed in phase , the theory would have been refuted .
i began to collect every instance of circle-triangle-square .

as you all know , that return from exile , the second temple , reshaped judaism .
this is producing all sorts of tensions , all sorts of dynamics that are deeply disturbing .

those girls have never touched google .
i &apos;d like to talk to you today about the human brain , which is what we do research on at the university of california .

governments are not changing it . why ?
finally , we could make the particles migrate to over the poles , so we could arrange the climate engineering so it really focused on the poles .

the next thing that happens is the light ends evaporate , and some of the toxic things float into the water column and kill fish eggs and smaller fish and things like that , and shrimp .
using the very first telephone , watson was in fact dialed into the heavens .
maybe the system , of which i was a part , was letting you down .

the best civil engineers we had , the best planners , the best architects .

and as we heard last night , as we &apos;ve heard earlier this week , are absolutely , fundamentally vital to the ability to craft new solutions , is we &apos;ve got to craft new political realities .
many women were taken as slaves by rebels and soldiers , as sexual slaves who were forced also to carry the ammunition and the water and the food for the soldiers .

but if you &apos;re boltzmann , you know that if you wait long enough , the random fluctuations of those molecules will occasionally bring them into lower entropy configurations .
jh : well , i love the idea that somewhere within this idea of fine motion and control with the traditional skills that you have with your hand , some sort of more elemental force gets revealed , and that &apos;s the beauty here .
it quickly escalates .
we need someone for .

craig venter &apos;s tremendous and brilliant attempt to dna sequence things in the ocean is great .
for each project we do a film .
then it came way down .
and that , and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that , may be , in the end , the finest reward that we earn from this journey of discovery that started half a century ago .
they all come up and they &apos;re like , &quot; you know , my aunt &apos;s sister &apos;s babysitter &apos;s dog &apos;s chicken went to china and adopted a girl . &quot;
i have been there for a long time .

as late as 1992 , ibm was known to say you couldn &apos;t possibly build a corporate network using internet protocol .
well done , everyone . now that is worth plus-one physical resilience , which means that your body can withstand more stress and heal itself faster .

and i asked them to do a project together , tackle the issues affecting their country in cartoons , yes , in cartoons .
then i was very lucky to win the competition to build the second pompidou center in france in the city of metz .
only three percent were lawyers or doctors or teachers .
in essence , what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve studied the science , we &apos;ve looked at the behavior , we &apos;ve seen over 2,000 kills by these amazing animals .
all right , i &apos;m going to get on my knees and do it .
the students should teach their teachers .
today , indian women have a sizable life expectancy edge over indian men .
the reason i &apos;m showing you this is i &apos;m hoping that the scene that i &apos;m going to show you will look familiar and sound familiar , now that you &apos;ve listened to some girls &apos; voices .
we also have the sweat bees , and these are little gems flying around .
having gone through the data , i then needed to demonstrate where that food ends up .
&quot; ... youngest republican , &quot; okay , we &apos;re finished .
you can read it in about two hours .

i have to take a moment .
we addressed on the board the major questions that have not been answered .
the telescope , going up in space , it unfolds in two places .
i was not an activist .
because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space , the same size as our home , the solar system . now that cube is very empty by human standards , but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter .
i will tell you a little bit about irrational behavior .
that &apos;s a homemade noise dampener .

the maximum efficient distance for regeneration is only about one centimeter .
it could get awkward , right ?
often the first time anyone saw what happened to their house was on virtual earth .

what i discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces .
but as we look , what &apos;s out there , we &apos;ve barely scratched the surface on what is available on this planet .
so we are four of us in four corners of the world .
you would think it might take eight years to go back to the same speed , maybe 10 years -- no , it &apos;s 45 years .
there are little machines doing things in experimental bases .
it was unequivocally not something a squirrel could chew on .
thank you .
if we had started in 2005 , it would have required emission reductions of three percent per year to restore planetary energy balance and stabilize climate this century .
the reasons for this have a lot to with the dominance of the two big demographic groups right now : the baby boomers retiring -- and then there &apos;s a gap , generation x , which is a small generation .
depression , for example , is the third-leading cause of disability , alongside conditions such as diarrhea and pneumonia in children .
em : there actually are far more charging stations than people realize , and at tesla we developed something called a supercharging technology , and we &apos;re offering that if you buy a model s for free , forever .
i don &apos;t necessarily think the film is so interesting .
so , for the essence of what makes the difference to enable progress , seek good explanations , the ones that can &apos;t be easily varied , while still explaining the phenomena .
such a random jumble of letters is said to have a very high entropy .
and this represents their habit of basking on the surface when the sun is out .
fiction is flowing water .

there are so many good things which are happening right here in kibera .
so , we &apos;ve targeted those systems to make the molecules work better .
so , to begin with , however , i have to give you a very , very quick lesson in developmental biology , with apologies to those of you who know some biology .
let me act compassionately .
so people get wrapped up in it . and we took a team of designers , and we sent them off to america . and we gave them a budget , what we thought was a set of deliverables , a timetable , and nothing else .
it &apos;s in that context that i work .
because before the &quot; vagina monologues , &quot; i will say that 80 percent of my consciousness was closed off to what was really going on in this reality .
i don &apos;t know what this kind of stuff will do in their gills .
now this was -- you make a joint of six , you make an icosahedron .
i can give you fast control with low reduction ratios in these gears , or i can give you power ; i can &apos;t give you both .
i will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat .
mandela , the great man mandela .
let me tell you the story of shriram , an 18 month boy in bihar , a northern state in india .
these decisions are clearly a reflection of the actor &apos;s policy .
but that , as i said , we live in this environment where all these obstacles are being put in our way .
in coal mines , this canary was supposed to be close to the miners .
so they will , in fact , be quite easy for us to detect .
it &apos;s a several thousand-pound animal .
and in my little corner of the world , these two things are actually related , and i want to tell you how tonight .
i don &apos;t eat breakfast . no lunch .
so you &apos;re feeling the wind -- and this tremendous wind now that you &apos;re going to be feeling -- and you want to go perpendicular to the wind or downwind , if you are in fact able to see where the blast was in front of you .
keep your seats -- it &apos;s going to be okay .
the body yes , but not all the motor skills that we have .
and the differences in scale between this tiny sea dragon and this enormous humpback whale was like something out of a science-fiction movie .
we get one from mom , one from dad .
i took the copenhagen subway map and i renamed all the stations to abstract musical provocations , and the players , who are synchronized with stopwatches , follow the timetables , which are listed in minutes past the hour .
now the lesson of that seems clear to me , and i don &apos;t know why it isn &apos;t informing public debate .
all of those are gone .
we &apos;re still trying to explain and come to terms with what is the evolutionary advantage of this .
nobody &apos;s ever done it before , so i &apos;m going to go do it .
the second reason i undertook this is because i &apos;m concerned about the rise of fundamentalism , religious fundamentalism , and people who say they take the bible literally , which is , according to some polls , as high as 45 or 50 percent of america .
let me tell you a little bit about how languages fundamentally differ .
we just think of good weather and bad weather .
or you can go to places like this .
now there are still barriers in front of we people with disabilities .
they weren &apos;t allowed to stay there anymore ; they had to be returned to vienna -- as i say , an unfeasibly long way away in those days .
one day , 16 years after i had this poster on my wall , i lay in bed and looked at her , and i suddenly thought , i wonder what the painter did to her to make her look like that .
and this substance may seem invisible to us , but it has a physical reality .
and it need beavers to create the wetlands , and maybe some other things .
that &apos;s basically how this thing operates .
over here , you see a paleographic chart that shows what has been deciphered so far , starting with the letter a , &quot; ālep , &quot; at the top , and &quot; bêt , &quot; in the middle , and so forth .
and he was really gagging . i thought he might throw up on me , actually .
we are not good at reasoning with uncertainty .
i don &apos;t work with people in any kind of traumatic situation .
instead of having vaclav smil &apos;s &quot; massively fatal discontinuity &quot; of life , we can ensure the continuity of life .
next challenge , the biennial of the americas in denver asked , could i represent the 35 nations of the western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture ?
dad helped design the control panels for the ibm 360 computer .
or is it an imitation of one half the set of sounds we make to express disappointment ?
because i want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible .
i played in the backyard , learned to read , and even ate some of my vegetables .
you guys were amazing .
little did we know at that time that a trip to the dump and some research on the internet and plucking up the courage to act upon inspiration would take us on a life-changing journey of accidents and discoveries .
it &apos;s been a real honor . thank you .
you may think that &apos;s a weapon right there . in fact , that &apos;s a stamp . i used a stamp to defend canada &apos;s borders .
reputations are volatile . loyalties are fickle .
and the way to ask that question is to look at the neanderthal that comes from southern europe and compare it to genomes of people who live today .
can &apos;t you move them over to a place where there &apos;s less of a risk ? &quot;
if you had an acute congestive heart failure , they could bleed a pint of blood from you by opening up an arm vein , giving you a crude leaf preparation of digitalis and then giving you oxygen by tent .
but the thing is , i don &apos;t want to be a traffic cop .
now , if we &apos;re talking about medicine , and we &apos;re talking about healing , i &apos;d like to quote someone who hasn &apos;t been quoted .
so you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government .
so there &apos;s a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better .
science is objective , consciousness is subjective , therefore there cannot be a science of consciousness .
i brought my scientific colleagues and sustainability practitioners into the prison .
we either draw in a liquid sample , or we can actually take a solid core from the wall .
now these are multifunctional areas of the brain .
i mean , even here , yesterday i was walking across the street , and they showed three bishops were executed 500 years ago , right across the street from here .
and here &apos;s one that does concern me .
obviously trial and error is very important .
they can &apos;t subordinate those interests to the greater global public good .
and , in fact , emotional contagion can be broader still .
it gets me to meet incredible contractors like this , jim ellenberger from ellenberger services .
he negotiates with the serbs .
sometimes it can take two years to type that information into a computer , and sometimes , actually not infrequently , it actually never happens .
and for each car so financed , scrap almost one clunker , preferably the dirtiest ones .
if i take these countries back to the years of their independence , which is almost the same year -- &apos; 71 , &apos; 72 -- it &apos;s a quite amazing development which had happened .
if i project that , that would make me think that i would live until 120 if i don &apos;t crash on my motorbike .
what &apos;s pushing on it ?
so , it was a really big deal when the letters showed up .
in her case , i knew there was nothing i could do that was actually going to save her life .
and for example , some things we could do that would be policy solutions which are not really in the political air right now but perhaps with the change of administration would be -- use markets .
but for us , i want to talk about three factors today .
we go back regularly .
we have no idea what we &apos;re going to discover .
this was even before the web .
do you have that ?
we need networks that can find out what &apos;s going on .
and this is visible in the unstoppable change in language -- the fact that by the time the academy finishes their dictionary , it will already be well out of date .
you have to pay the army and the police to show law and order .
and thank you to all the photographers .
so one of the reasons that i have come here to talk about this today is to -- frankly , selfishly -- unburden myself and let it be known that this is not an untroubled mind that has written all of these books .
and in 1945 , he published an article in a magazine called atlantic monthly .
just push them through , good . thank you .
so i &apos;m going to show you now a little experiment that we did .
the inhabitants literally built up these homes with their own hands , and this labor of love instills a great sense of pride in many families living in this tower .
so anyway , you &apos;ve got basically an idea of where things came from .
and with a particular rotation , we can look down through this pattern in eight dimensions along a symmetry axis and see all the particles at once .
we want to clear away the toxic soil from this area and have an organic garden .
so how does electricity ignite residential fires ?
beauty and seduction , i believe , is nature &apos;s tool for survival , because we will protect what we fall in love with .
if you ever go bar hopping , who do you want to take with you ?
and i think that that is very troubling , and in a sense , i &apos;ve been reflecting on turning that part of us off .
she said , &quot; yes , sir . &quot;
there are only 700 atms in the country . opportunity .
we had a memorable fight . feminism is dated ?
way back machine . and i said to myself , oh yeah !
i then go to a news site , look for some headlines .
i got an indoor sunburn doing this while shooting in los angeles .
the second question is , who are you connecting ?
this is an opportunity ! energy needs -- it &apos;s an opportunity .
natasha : later , i &apos;ll do that later .
emily dickinson once wrote , &quot; parting is all we need to know of hell . &quot;

so &quot; god is in heaven surrounded by his angels &quot; was translated as -- &#91; igbo &#93; .
about half of them , 600,000 , have permanent damage to their heart that will cause them to have very bad problems later on .
in other words , we can &apos;t create supermodel mice .
so we &apos;re able to do the simulation , but this is two days on a desktop .
now to put some neurobiological meat on this abstract model , we constructed a simple one-dimensional world for our favorite subject , fruit flies .
the center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment .
okay .
we &apos;re obsessed with morality as social creatures .
you then put a membrane on that and you apply pressure -- so that &apos;s part of the extra program .
but at the same time , when we hear that the housing market is hopeful , we think , &quot; oh , my house is definitely going to double in price . &quot;
if we had redwood-like biology , if we got a touch of gangrene in our arm then we could just , you know , extract the nutrients extract the nutrients and the moisture out of it until it fell off .
and we then wanted to see whether we can match our ancestral maps with digital maps made somewhere in the world .
this is a perfect 90-degree angle by nature .
and what vannevar bush was saying was the way we use information is broken .
some of them were hypothermic , some of them were frostbitten , some were both .
so everything that matters , that &apos;s important , is invisible .
that &apos;s the quest .
what &apos;s interesting is that at the same time , the number of genes that we &apos;re discovering is rising very quickly .
and so what we needed to do was increase the wing area so that we just had more grip , develop higher forces .
and as we just heard earlier , of course , we &apos;re also learning how to put information on dumb objects .
that &apos;s a very appealing picture , however , it &apos;s just not true .
this particular classroom happens to be in the state of michoacan .
i saw this leaflet and it said , &quot; there are millions of slaves in the world today . &quot;
it makes sense , right ? there &apos;s open space , the planes can take off and land without worrying about creating noise or avoiding tall buildings .
they have two types of flight muscle : so-called power muscle , which is stretch-activated , which means that it activates itself and does not need to be controlled on a contraction-by-contraction basis by the nervous system .
theories can be shared , and you don &apos;t have to be a professor with multiple degrees to have your ideas valued .
he &apos;s not happy , and why isn &apos;t he happy ?
after about 15 seconds , her friend appeared -- she had been hiding behind a display -- and they laughed and hugged each other and ran away .
ok , i can see , if i found something , up , up , and they continue , up up up .
the camel smells were unbelievable .
we have our first stars .
thank you .
we can cope with the subtleties of language brilliantly -- and there are interesting evolutionary questions about how we got here .
hold on .
there &apos;s also a time to give .
now , retro-vaccinology is just one technique within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design .
now , i did not speak portuguese .
we are all cut from the same genetic cloth .
so we are faced with a paradox .
if you press on a hose pipe in a sealed system , it bulges someplace else .
let me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion .
so , different species of plants grow in different places , and some pollen carries further than others .
i wanted &quot; upwake &quot; to have the same audiovisual qualities as a movie would .
back to the theme of the presentation : in multidisciplinary research , how on earth does a process engineer used to working with boilers end up producing a medical device which transforms his own life ?
as pascal said , even the one who hangs himself , somehow , is looking for cessation of suffering -- he finds no other way .
he set up his prosaically entitled newsgroup , bankfrauds @ yahoo.co.uk before arriving in britain in 2005 to take a masters in chemical engineering at manchester university .
thanks so much for your talk .
robert ghrist : welcome to calculus .
well , he had all these wonderful little golden apples , and she &apos;d run ahead , and he &apos;d roll a little golden apple .
well i &apos;m afraid not .
and you can see it &apos;s not that easy , that it is war which caused this .
well i find parents out on the front lines very aware their children are going down for the count .
the fear is that the longer we delay any solution , the more the world will look to the u.s.
well for the sake of time , i want to focus on just three strategies .
in this deceptively casual talk , charles leadbeater weaves a tight argument that innovation isn &apos;t just for professionals anymore . passionate amateurs , using new tools , are creating products and paradigms that companies can &apos;t .
the digital universe is the basis of our space show productions that we do -- our main space shows in the dome .
use more force ?
imagine a restaurant that serves michelin-starred food , but actually where the restaurant smells of sewage and there &apos;s human feces on the floor .
the viruses , those quasi-organisms among which are the prophages , the gene weavers that promote the continued evolution in the lives of the bacteria , are a virtually unknown frontier of modern biology , a world unto themselves .
he said , &quot; we have lived in this world where little things are done for love and big things for money .
but it &apos;s only half the story if we &apos;re really looking at solving problems of poverty , because it &apos;s not long-term sustainable .
the icon of icons finally has a face .
anyway , he was a photographer and a street educator , and he always taught us to obey the law very strictly .
and today &apos;s political slogan is , &quot; bijli , sadak , pani , &quot; which means &quot; electricity , water and roads . &quot;
now if you look at the cost of opec , it cost seven trillion dollars -- on the milken institute study last year -- seven trillion dollars since 1976 , is what we paid for oil from opec .
if i really want the music to go there , the best way for me to do it is to listen .
and the game is won .
and his colleagues don &apos;t think of him as a crank .
a harrowing predilection for the uses of force had become commonplace , with an equal distaste for the alternative forms of influence .
and the last thing is that -- actually , the direction of the conversation .
but if you &apos;ve graduated from high school , i can almost guarantee you &apos;ve seen this information before .
they couldn &apos;t anticipate cell phones and the internet and all this kind of stuff .
actually he did , but it turned out to be the u.s. air force , which doesn &apos;t count as extraterrestrial intelligence .
it probably has lies in it as well .
i &apos;ve felt it in the operating room , at the bedside .
so i scraped a load of reported figures from various news outlets and then scaled the boxes according to those amounts .
it &apos;s physically possible to lose weight .
i &apos;m interested in what i like to call the &quot; triple bottom line &quot; that sustainable development can produce .
everything left over is external to me .
pete alcorn : the world in 2200
but if you put something on top of it , it disbalances it . and so it would tip over .
mega-farms , feed lots , chemical amendments , long-distance travel , food processing .
and this is : how do you make a teacher great ?
so that means that certain parts of the periodic table are axiomatically off-limits .
they have to have a much more participatory governance in many civil society organizations .
if i put the flap on the edge , it uses a half circle of paper .
the charges of all known particles can be plotted in a four-dimensional charge space , and projected down to two dimensions like this so we can see them .
with this event , a new era in native american history began .
no , because a widely shared design practice doesn &apos;t necessarily give you a unity of culture -- and it definitely is not &quot; in the dna . &quot;
it &apos;s an indian story about an indian woman and her journey .
and they can send the poison into the system .
wk : i think we have discovered a very important issue in the arab world -- that people care , people care about this great transformation .
my brother , henry , he died tragically when we were teenagers .
1985 , right at the center of the reagan years -- that &apos;s , we &apos;re , there &apos;s , we &apos;ve , it &apos;s .
no , it &apos;s pockets of walkability on the sites of under-performing properties .
and i wanted to finish with this photograph , a picture i made on a very stormy day in new zealand when i just laid on the bottom amidst a school of fish swirling around me .
and on this farm there was the farmer , his wife , and there was the four-year-old daughter .
we change as people through games , because we &apos;re involved , and we &apos;re playing , and we &apos;re learning as we do so . thank you .
that &apos;s all that &apos;s necessary .
and so today , i would like to present to you a few examples of what this represents .
we &apos;re pasting portraits -- so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market .
but be careful .
so , how could this happen ?
the fort in san francisco at the time had about 1,300 soldiers .
and we realize how great would it be if we just had some a , b , c and d labels to talk about them more easily .
remember i said feeling , model , reality ; i said reality doesn &apos;t change . it actually does .
and it goes down the sides and goes into the critter &apos;s mouth .
and this is the answer -- we would have to change .
love , action .
in the last three years , i &apos;ve traveled to 45 different countries , working with schools and companies in the midst of an economic downturn .
i can see his hands reaching out , and i can see his face in terror , looking at me , saying , &quot; help me , dad . &quot;
and it was just lightning fast ; the way she was working was almost unbelievable .
so that &apos;s a bit of a support for the leviathan theory .
it is taking the hand of the architect to actually remove the hand of the architect in favor of the hand of the artistic director .
and they &apos;re focusing on function .
another example , this was completely packed with houses , and then we built this , what we call , a knowledge square .
do they , perhaps , include green infrastructure , so that we can take runoff and water that &apos;s going out of our houses and clean it and filter it and grow urban street trees ?
these are the sentiments of someone that &apos;s been away from home .
so it was traumatizing , actually .
it sits there about , say , 1.3 times the mass of the sun .
and generally arrive about 30 pounds lighter at the other end .
and the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies , just barely walking and talking , would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers , but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli .
paint your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward , 100 years forward , how you would like to think of the world , balancing moral progress with richness .

to tell you the kinds of societal challenges that are going to come up in the new machine age , i want to tell a story about two stereotypical american workers .
now , i started out as a strategy professor , and i &apos;m still a strategy professor .
he &apos;s by far the happiest man ever measured by science .
it &apos;s not , perhaps , the dimensions appreciated by art critics or architecture critics or city planners .
you know , all i wanted to do was draw pictures of horses when i was little .
now maybe cows have a really rich internal mental life and are so smart that they choose not to let us realize it , but we eat them .
how do you evaluate all the scientific data around a product , the data that &apos;s changing on a weekly , if not a daily , basis ?
it &apos;s coming from us .
how we get spectra ?
yet , their draglines are not the toughest .
and by that i mean it &apos;s products for which the research and development costs are really high , and the manufacturing costs are low .
and then i went in and i had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages .
so we must find other solutions .
so that would give us extra cortex to do more interesting things than just operating the body .
for example , if you take , and you make a comparison between a recent kind of city , what i &apos;ll call , simplistically , a north american city -- and detroit is not a bad example , it is very car dependent .
okay , so i &apos;m going to take this really filthy water , and put it in here . do you want a drink yet ?
and now let &apos;s look from the south , looking up , and let &apos;s see this in relief .
and it &apos;s economic empowerment and the ability for a woman to say , &quot; i am as much contributing to this family , or more , than you are . &quot;
when they come to me , they help me to treat the people , to help .
these christians , who are these christians ?

and in the time since galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies , the known universe has come to us through light , across vast eras in cosmic history .
the getty here is moving their books to the ucla , which is where we have one these scanning centers , and scanning their out-of-copyright books , which is fabulous .
they also made a basketball court .
and sometimes you create high art , and sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work .
and hopefully from that i get to learn something .
somehow , without any help or push from her older brother at all , suddenly amy disappeared off of the top of the bunk bed and landed with this crash on the floor .
they fly in and they pollinate .
no legends , no fairytales .
it &apos;s the homebrew computer club -- just like a hackerspace .
and they are heterosexuals who come from countries that have traditions of polygamy and relatively high levels of female autonomy , and almost all of those countries are in east or southern africa .

but much later , in 1871 , he did have something to say about it .
and that &apos;s a problem .
still , we very much wanted to see the aircraft that we &apos;d all helped build in the air , off the ground , like it was supposed to be .
they make use of exactly the same winds .
it &apos;s all that adrenaline rush . it &apos;s hard to give it up .
the man &apos;s sons were banished to live three kilometers away , in a cowshed .
these people inspire me , and they inspire me because they show us what is possible when you change the way you look at the world , change the way you look at your place in the world .
so , three types of vision , right ?
i says , &quot; i enjoyed your film . that &apos;s why . &quot;
each point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry of this very complex and beautiful shape .
we can allow smart and lucrative growth models that help people already be near where they want to be , so they don &apos;t need to go somewhere else .
but by the teen years , the features of transistors will be a few atoms in width , and we won &apos;t be able to shrink them any more .
and i can &apos;t get this thought out of my head , and i can &apos;t get that vision out of my sight , so i did what i had to do .
because it doesn &apos;t look like chinese food to them .
it &apos;s been going on since we can think of lombroso and the way he would define criminal faces .
it could be an &quot; l , &quot; of course .
but well before my imagination was my vocation , my imagination saved my life .
and to me , that is very , very critical .
but it &apos;s sublinear , and what that translates into is that , if you double the size of the organism , you actually only need 75 percent more energy .
outdoor clothier patagonia encouraged prospective buyers to check out ebay for its used products and to resole their shoes before purchasing new ones .
and at one point -- and i had some wine , i have to admit that -- at one point i said , &quot; if there was a contest , i would join . &quot;
&quot; you must get them custom made -- special , humongous guitars . &quot;
that did not make sense . they were not above a magma chamber .
that &apos;s just 12 percent of the population .
now , chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me , so i &apos;ve done that .
yeah !
well , that &apos;ll be all the slides .
so most everyone watches tv .
remember what i said , my love .
but we really need to test that .
so that &apos;s not all of the trials that were ever conducted on these drugs , because we can never know if we have those , but it is the ones that were conducted in order to get the marketing authorization .
and my family moved out of an urban place , where we used to live , to a remote rural area where it was safer .

it enables him to hire men who used to get paid 50 cents a day and pay them five dollars a day .
i want to talk about penguins today .
i still do a lot of that , mainly for estimating .
and feynman also understood this .
and the thing that you really take away from that , the kind of surface thing that you take away from it , is not that we &apos;re all one , although i &apos;m going to tell you about that , but rather how different we are .
what kinds of people would join a global community welcoming people from every discipline and culture , who seek a deeper understanding of the world , and who hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all ?
and so we work on these particular issues to see if we can create a morality from the bottom up , so to speak , without necessarily god and religion involved , and to see how we can get to an evolved morality .
and copenhagen , although it &apos;s a dense city , is not dense compared with the really dense cities .
thou shall not stereotype .
that looks like a coastline .
this is the time to swim with real humility .
there is some good successes .

there &apos;s no question , none , that so-called lifestyle diseases -- diabetes , heart disease , stroke , some cancers -- are diseases that are far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world .
thank you so much . i &apos;m going to try to take you on a journey of the underwater acoustic world of whales and dolphins .
about two months ago , i had the great breakthrough -- one of my great , kind of shining achievements -- which is that my website finally became a top result for &quot; steven johnson . &quot;
we interpret what we see , select the most workable of the multiple choices .
you can imagine yourself being a mouse or fly inside of it , looking out of its camera .

the sharp , crisp outlines of this formation make it the best one for finding shapes in .
if you actually insulate and isolate the machinery of the ship from the hull , you can reduce that noise by 99 percent .
now , those are fun to look at .
and the market reformer was successful there .
if we can get the 10 cents , all the rest of it flows .
now , from the shah &apos;s perspective , though , he wanted to keep this as secret as possible , so when yitzhak rabin , for instance , traveled to iran in the &apos; 70s , he usually wore a wig so that no one would recognize him .
imagine us as a human race not knowing where we came from .
it gives it information . by adding information to matter , it gives it a function that &apos;s different than without that structure .
and the last one i &apos;ve already mentioned , that fell to you .
i get it .
any incentive system can be subverted by bad will .
peace is not &quot; kumbaya , my lord . &quot;
